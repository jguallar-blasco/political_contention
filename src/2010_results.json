{"2010FOMC20100127meeting.txt": [" MR. NELSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will discuss the staff\u2019s recommendations for normalizing the terms on the primary credit facility and reducing TAF auction amounts to zero.  We are not requesting any decisions from the Board at this time. Turning first to primary credit\u2014primary credit was established in 2003 as a no-questions-asked lending facility available only to sound financial institutions as a backup source of funds.  In order to encourage institutions to use the facility as a backup funding source without a need for the Federal Reserve to administer credit requests, the funds were provided at an above-market rate and generally on an overnight basis.  When the facility was established and during the years prior to the financial crisis, the primary credit rate was set at 100 basis points over the target federal funds rate.  Analysis of the available information had suggested that a 100 basis point spread would make primary credit at least a bit more expensive than similar funds for almost all depository institutions. These terms on primary credit appeared to have been largely successful in accomplishing the Federal Reserve\u2019s objectives for the program.  Except in rare instances, depository institutions used the facility as a backup source of funds and appeared to be willing to use primary credit when the federal funds rate rose above the primary credit rate. Easing the terms of primary credit was one of the Federal Reserve\u2019s first responses to the financial crisis.  On August 17, 2007, the Federal Reserve narrowed the spread of the primary credit rate over the FOMC\u2019s target rate to 50 basis points and lengthened the maximum maturity to 30 days.  On March 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve lowered the spread to 25 basis points and extended the maximum maturity to 90 days. The substantial easing in the terms of primary credit was a necessary step to provide liquidity to banks during the financial crisis.  However, there is now a significant misalignment between the terms of primary credit and the intended use of the facility in routine circumstances.  In particular, primary credit is too inexpensive for the interest rate alone to motivate depository institutions to use the facility as a backup funding source, and loan maturities longer than overnight encourage depository institutions to use primary credit as an ongoing funding source.  Currently, about 20 depository institutions have been borrowing primary credit continuously for over three months, and five have been borrowing for more than a year.  A branch of Depfa, a German bank, which alone accounts for more than 90 percent of primary credit, has been borrowing continuously for 15 months.  Several Reserve Bank discount officers have expressed concerns that some depository institutions have become overly reliant on discount window funding. With conditions in bank funding markets approaching pre-crisis levels, the staff recommends that the terms on primary credit be adjusted back toward their pre-crisis configuration.  The Federal Reserve took a first step in that direction on January 14, when the maximum maturity on primary credit loans was reduced to 28 days.  A second step in normalizing the terms on primary credit could be an increase in the spread between the primary credit rate and the top of the fed funds target range to 50 basis points, which would set the primary credit rate at 75 basis points if the target funds rate is unchanged.  In one scenario for such a move, the Chairman could foreshadow an increase in his monetary policy testimony in late February; if they so desired, Reserve Bank boards of directors could then recommend an increase; and the Board could approve the recommendations shortly thereafter.  Any increase could be announced using language that made it clear that the move was not a signal about the outlook for the stance of monetary policy.  A third step in normalizing the terms on primary credit could then be to shorten the maximum maturity on primary credit loans to pre-crisis levels\u2014overnight for all but the smallest institutions\u2014perhaps in early spring.  The announcement of such a change could indicate that the Board expects depository institutions to use primary credit as a backup source of funds. The Board and Reserve Banks might elect to defer any further tightening of the primary credit rate spread for several months in order to assess the experience with a 50 basis point spread.  If a spread of 50 basis points is sufficient to limit use, it may be preferable to a wider spread, in part because it might help reduce stigma:  A narrower spread would likely result in somewhat more frequent use of the window, which, by making borrowing less unusual, might help overcome the negative views about borrowing on the part of bank management, supervisors, and market participants. Turning now to the term auction facility (TAF)\u2014on January 11, the Federal Reserve auctioned $75 billion in 28-day TAF credit.  The auction was again substantially undersubscribed, with depository institutions requesting only $39 billion.  As a result, the funds were provided at the minimum bid rate of 25 basis points, the rate paid on excess reserves.  The Board has indicated on its website that there will be an auction on February 8, but no amount has been specified. In light of the continued improvement in bank funding markets and the resulting diminished demand for TAF funds, the staff recommends that TAF auction amounts be reduced to zero relatively quickly.  In particular, the staff recommends that $50 billion be offered in February and $25 billion in March and that the auctions be discontinued subsequently.  Reducing TAF auction amounts to zero would be consistent with the ongoing normalization of Federal Reserve liquidity operations, would ensure that no bank currently using the facility remained reliant on TAF funding, and would help to reduce reserve balances modestly in advance of a period in which the FOMC might be tightening policy.  The staff also recommends that the minimum bid rate on the TAF be increased to 50 basis points if the primary credit rate were increased to 75 basis points so as to preserve the spread between the primary credit rate and the TAF minimum bid rate.   An alternative approach would be to auction small amounts of TAF credit on an ongoing basis so that the TAF could be ramped up immediately in a contingency.  However, responses to a survey of the Subcommittee on Credit Risk Management and feedback from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff members who conduct the auctions suggest that the TAF could be ramped up from zero with a delay of at most a couple of weeks.  Because regular discount window credit, potentially at a reduced rate, would remain available as a first line of defense against heightened credit strains in the early days of a severe crisis, the added benefit of auctioning a small amount of TAF credit on an ongoing basis might be less than the benefits of reducing TAF auction amounts to zero for the intermediate term.   Even if the auction amounts are reduced to zero, the TAF would remain authorized in Regulation A.  Whether to have a permanent TAF and, if so, in what form is an issue that could be addressed further in the future, when the Federal Reserve\u2019s post-financial-crisis monetary policy framework becomes clearer.  That concludes my prepared remarks", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the original memo I thought you also proposed\u2014maybe I just missed this in your commentary\u2014that we withdraw the \u201crenewable on request\u201d clause.  Is that correct", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Pecuniary externalities.  Governor Kohn", " MR. SACK.  I think it\u2019s problematic to go too quickly, especially with the reverse repos, because first of all, the tools are new and the markets have to adjust to them.  Second, when we use reverse repurchase agreements, it requires a reallocation of flows of short-term funding.  We will be taking funds that used to flow, say, into the tri-party repo market.  You will have someone with securities that they used to finance in tri-party repo, and they now have to find the funds from another source.  Ultimately that source has to be the banks because the reserves come out of the banks.  And our view is that the reallocation of flows and the relationships and changes it would require should caution us about thinking we could go extremely fast with reverse repos.  So I think there are advantages to starting early and gradually ramping up the program, especially on reverse repos", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just have one question about the \u201cearly reserve drain\u201d strategy, which is on page 8 in the middle.  I guess my question about this, and a lot of the discussion about this, is that under this scenario you\u2019d be doing the reserve-draining operations considerably before you\u2019d be trying to raise overnight rates.  But in order to do that, you are really putting upward pressure on short-term interest rates anyway, say, 30-day rates or other short-term rates.  So in a macroeconomic sense, how much difference is there really.  Aren\u2019t you really saying that you\u2019re raising one type of very short term interest rate so that you don\u2019t have to raise another type of very short term interest rate.  Most of what we look at macroeconomically speaking is at a quarterly level anyway.  So, how much difference is there really.  If I vote for this strategy, am I not just voting for higher short-term interest rates", " MR. BULLARD.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  You have a 30-day Treasury out there, and now you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m going to give banks an option to deposit at the Fed at some rate.  So suppose you have to go to 75 or 100 basis points on your term deposit in order to get it to attract enough reserves in there.  Isn\u2019t that an alternative for the bank as opposed to going and buying the 30-day Treasury.  So you\u2019re putting upward pressure on rates no matter how you cut it.  Forget about the overnight rate.  No one is trading at the overnight rate.  And the macroeconomics for that, if you\u2019re writing papers about it, you would not worry about", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It depends on where the money is coming from", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  It depends in part where the money comes from.  Imagine a bank that every day has excess reserves, and then you have a term deposit facility, and it just moves some of those excess reserves that it has every day into the term deposit facility.  Well, that is not going to really affect anything else.  It\u2019s really if the money is getting pulled from other sources.  If that bank were selling bills to fund the term deposit facility, it would be something different.  So I think it really depends on where the money comes from.  I think the argument is that, at the very beginning of this process, the money is probably moving from an overnight bank reserve to the term deposit facility and nothing else really is going on, so the pressure is de minimis.  But as you go further, then you are starting to rearrange", " MR. KOHN.  I would think that the expectational effect would dominate whether this interest rate goes up a little or that interest rate goes down a little.  Once we start draining reserves, people will build in a path for some rate\u2014the federal funds rate, some market rate\u2014and I think that will really be much more important than whether 30-day Treasury bills are higher or lower by 10 basis points", "   MR. SICHEL.  An important element of our outlook is the anticipated pickup in private payrolls.  As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 6, we expect payrolls to flatten out this quarter and then to begin to turn up more definitively in the second quarter.  Final sales have been growing for a few quarters, which should help businesses gain confidence in the resilience of the recovery, a point supported by recent indicators of business sentiment.  In addition, as shown by the blue line in the panel to the right, the recent very large increases in labor productivity have, in our estimation, pushed the level of productivity in the nonfarm business sector well above its structural level (the red line).  We believe that there is limited scope for firms to achieve further outsized gains in productivity, suggesting that hiring will need to commence soon as output continues to expand.   Indicators of layoffs also are broadly consistent with a leveling-out in employment.  For example, the middle panel plots initial claims for unemployment insurance over recent business cycles.  The turquoise bars mark NBER recessions, while the yellow shaded region to the right covers the range that we currently estimate to be consistent with unchanged employment.  As you can see, claims have just entered the upper end of that range.  The bottom left panel highlights some margins of adjustment other than direct hiring that firms tend to use around the time of an upturn in employment.  The workweek (the black line) and temporary-help employment (the red line) both have turned up recently.  While the recent upturns in these series are modest so far, they are in the range of moves that have been associated with employment upturns in the past, with those points marked by vertical lines for the last two episodes.  However, indicators of hiring remain lackluster.  The bottom right panel shows a composite index of help-wanted advertising that blends the old newspaper index with a measure of Internet job listings; this series has flattened out recently and has yet to show clear evidence of an upturn.  Although we view the available information as supportive of our forecast of a pickup in payrolls, considerable uncertainty attends our forecast of imminent employment gains. Exhibit 7 turns to the outlook for inflation.  The red line in the top left panel shows our estimate of the NAIRU plus the effect of extended and emergency unemployment benefits (labeled EEB).  The sum of these two pieces is about 6\u00bc percent over the forecast period, and the shaded area above the red line shows our estimate of resource slack.  We continue to expect that the wide margin of slack will put downward pressure on inflation.  In our projection, however, this effect is muted by the relative stability of long-run inflation expectations.  As shown to the right, survey measures of inflation expectations (the black and red lines) have been quite stable; although readings on the TIPS measure in recent months (the green line) look a bit elevated relative to earlier years, extracting a signal for inflation expectations remains difficult.  Elsewhere, we see little evidence of significant upward pressure on consumer price inflation.  As shown by the blue bars in the middle left panel, labor costs remain quiescent.  Compensation per hour has decelerated in recent years, and we project that increases in this measure of compensation will remain modest this year and next.  Moreover, given the large recent increases in labor productivity, unit labor costs (the red bars) are estimated to have fallen considerably in 2009.  And we expect these costs to increase only modestly over the next couple of years.  Finally, although core import prices, the middle right panel, are projected to move up noticeably in coming quarters, we estimate that this increase will have only a limited effect on consumer price inflation.  All told, as shown by the blue bars in the bottom panel, we continue to project that core PCE inflation will slow a little further over the medium term, reaching about 1 percent next year.  Overall PCE inflation (the green bars) is pushed up this year by a pickup in energy prices, but we expect the headline index to converge toward the core next year as energy prices decelerate.  Nathan will now continue our presentation", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the staff forecast, my outlook has not changed much from the December FOMC meeting, despite a fairly disappointing employment report.  That report highlighted that we are still losing jobs, that many were taking part-time work for economic reasons, and many have had little success in finding work despite being unemployed for some time.  As the recent Massachusetts election has highlighted, people remain quite focused on the very weak labor market and are concerned that economic growth will be insufficient to make much progress in labor markets.  I still anticipate that unemployment will decline only gradually from these very elevated levels, with a trajectory for the unemployment rate that is quite similar to that of the Greenbook. In discussions with business leaders from around the District, there is a clear sentiment that major investment and hiring decisions can wait until there is more clarity on the economic outlook, and many are refocusing their investment programs.  A president of a major university in Boston highlighted that, despite some recovery in its endowment, it remains well below peak and the university remains concerned about future prospects.  Major projects have been shelved altogether, whereas others have been examined for a possible joint development.  A major builder highlighted that lack of credit remains a significant issue but that, given significant vacancies and weak demand for new space, major construction does not make sense as long as the cost of building remains much higher than the cost of buying.  With the CMBS market severely disrupted and foreclosures looming, he sees little prospect for a turnaround in commercial construction in the near term.  Such sentiments highlight that it may be some time before business fixed investment is a significant driver in this recovery.  Despite the New England economy being somewhat better off than the rest of the country, many of the states have significant revenue shortfalls.  Even with stimulus money from the federal government, state and local spending is likely to be restrained for some time. The economy is clearly susceptible to external shocks.  While many of our problems earlier in the recession affected the rest of the world, Chinese restrictions on their lending and mounting fiscal challenges in many of the peripheral European countries could reverberate here.  Until the economy is more self-sustained, negative shocks can have an outsized effect, given that with the zero bound on interest rates and the prospect of large future deficits makes it difficult to offset negative shocks with monetary or fiscal stimulus.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Let me go in reverse order.  A fair amount of capital seems to be flowing into the banking system.  There is a lot of private equity on the sidelines or being mobilized to go into the community bank sector, for example.  Large banks have been able to raise capital, even in recent months, quite notably at the large end of the scale.  So I don\u2019t see the economy as terribly constrained by the amount of bank capital.  And even if it were, I don\u2019t think buying MBS is the right way to recapitalize banks.  It\u2019s kind of an indirect channel.  As for housing wealth, if what we are doing is subsidizing mortgage-backed securities and keeping housing prices artificially high as a result, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a healthy way to build a recovery either.  I think we ought to be aiming to get housing wealth and housing prices to where they ought to be relative to the economy, if they are being held up by our mortgage-backed securities holdings", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My views on the outlook have changed remarkably little during the intermeeting period in spite of incoming data prompting us to revise up substantially our estimate of last quarter\u2019s GDP growth.  As the Greenbook emphasizes, that upward revision mainly reflects a dramatic reduction in the pace of inventory liquidation.  While it\u2019s heartening that inventory overhangs are no longer such a major drag on the economy, I would be more reassured if the surprise had reflected unexpected strength in final sales.  Instead, both my retail contacts and the incoming data suggest that the holiday shopping season was lackluster, even though tight inventory management made it far more profitable than 2008.  Moreover, businesses are still very cautious about capital spending. Going forward, we anticipate moderate growth in the first half of this year, similar to the Greenbook, and see this forecast as consistent with recent data.  I expect real GDP growth to strengthen over time, rising from about 3\u00bd percent this year to about 4\u00bd percent in 2011 and 2012.  This forecast is predicated on strong private demand coming on line as the impetus to growth from fiscal stimulus fades away later this year.  Private demand seems likely to pick up as financial conditions ease further with higher equity prices, narrower risk spreads, and improved bank credit supply. The risks to this forecast appear fairly evenly balanced.  On the upside, it is possible that history will repeat itself.  Every previous deep postwar recession has been followed by faster growth than I expect this time.  Post-recession booms commonly reflect a spurt of pent-up demand, and we could see such a snapback if, for example, households and businesses postponed spending during the period of greatest economic uncertainty and now feel more secure and ready to open their wallets.  So far such a scenario doesn\u2019t square with information from my contacts, but it remains a plausible risk.  On the downside, although my economic growth forecast is similar to the Greenbook, it\u2019s strikingly optimistic relative to most private-sector forecasters.  About 90 percent of private-sector growth projections, including those in the Blue Chip sample, predict weaker growth than I do.  My optimism may not be justified if, for example, credit constraints are more persistent than expected, perhaps fed by mounting commercial real estate losses at banks.  Also, the fallout on households from foreclosures could be more severe than I anticipate. Turning to the labor market, I expect unemployment to remain painfully high for years, edging down to 9\u00bd percent by the end of this year and 8\u00bc percent by the end of 2011.  However, if last year is any guide, then this forecast is especially uncertain because the big surprise in 2009 was the steep rise in the unemployment rate.  For example, the median FOMC projection for last January was a very accurate guide to real GDP growth and core and overall inflation in 2009.  For these three variables, our median forecast error was inside the one standard-error bands that we published based on past projection errors.  The fly in the ointment was the median FOMC forecast for the 2009 unemployment rate, which was off by 1\u00bd percentage points, an error of three standard deviations.  A three-sigma annual forecast error should come along about once every 400 years", "  [Laughter] MR. KOHN.  This time I mean it.  The severest recession since World War II and an unprecedented financial disruption, and I had the risks balanced around my central tendencies.  I must admit, as I was staring at the computer screen trying to decide whether growth would be 3.2 or 3.5 or inflation 1.3 or 1.4, it occurred to me that the risks and uncertainties were different and more profound than the stuff I usually concentrate on when making a forecast.  Now, maybe this is because I was doing this last Friday, and a lot of things were happening. I would include in that list of risks, first, the distinct possibility that the regulatory and legislative response to the crisis and the public anger and fear it engendered could undermine the rebound in the availability of credit from banks and, more generally, whether uncertainty about a broad range of policies and even a sense of hostility to businesses might not inhibit business investment.  For banks we are raising base levels of capital and liquidity, possibly adding surcharges for systemically important institutions, taxing borrowing, and restricting business models.  Now, each of these may be desirable to some extent when taken alone, but how they will add up does worry me.  We are raising the cost of bank lending to households and businesses.  It was too low before.  Risk premiums were too low, but I think we run a risk of going too far in the other direction. Second, I see a number of question marks overseas with potentially significant effects.  This overlaps to some extent with the Vice Chairman\u2019s comments.  Greece\u2019s situation is a test of whether the institutions of the European Community and the monetary union are strong enough and coherent enough to craft a solution that preserves discipline but can be accepted by the Greek population.  And Greece\u2019s problems will put additional pressure for fiscal consolidation on other European countries with fiscal problems.  China\u2019s economic growth has been an important factor supporting the global recovery, but that growth was built on a 30 percent increase in bank lending last year, much of it for questionable local government and state-owned enterprise investments, a lot of those investments in property markets driving up the prices of property.  I think we have seen this movie before\u2014lending supporting property prices, and it had kind of a bad ending.  Whether the government can walk the tightrope of sounder lending and less upward pressure on asset and consumer prices while sustaining robust growth is in my mind still an open question.  It could slip off either side of that tightrope, even in what is still a semi-command-and-control economy, and the Chinese government must deal with the issues that Bill was talking about in the current conjuncture, while needing to address the longer-run structural problems of inadequate domestic demand. Third, commodity prices and their implications were on my list of concerns.  China\u2019s move toward restraint has the important side effect of taking some pressure off commodity prices.  Oil prices have fallen $10 since early January, and thus have made me more confident in adopting the futures market path of slow increases in commodity prices.  Still, as I think the conversation with Nathan earlier suggested, we don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s driving these commodity prices.  A further spike is a risk with a number of adverse consequences.  Obviously it could raise inflation expectations, which would pressure central banks to withdraw stimulus before output was on a path that promised the eventual closure of gaps.  Just the mere rise in the commodity and petroleum prices reduces real income and spending power. So though the incoming data have tended to confirm that a recovery is under way and inflation is likely to be subdued, Mr. Chairman, I found plenty to worry about when I was putting my forecast together.  Thank you", " MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am going to try to answer two questions in my discussion today.  One is a familiar one:  What is the most significant development since we last met.  And the second is, Who knew free money would be so popular.  [Laughter] So I stared at my screen and tried to answer that first question on the most significant development since we last met, and Don, as usual, stole my homework assignment.  The most significant development is Washington.  The most significant development is the path and variance around policy in the intermeeting period with, I think, very real consequences for the real economy.  The negative feedback loop afflicts the political economy much as it afflicts the real economy.  It is said in Washington that even-numbered years, of which we are now early in one, bring strange things, and 2010 is proving to be persuasive evidence for that old maxim.  I\u2019m not making a statement principally about policy direction.  I\u2019m making a statement here principally about policy variance.  I\u2019m also not making a statement about gridlock, which tends not to be terribly bad news generally for real economies or financial markets.  But I am talking about a variance in policies that can be extremely harmful. I would underscore the reason for concern here with two emphases.  One, particularly now when the economy is at this transitional point, if the Greenbook forecast is right and the baton is passed ably from the public sector to the private sector, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that this is a time of Washington policy variance.  But I think it\u2019s maybe more important than ever.  The second reason for heightened concern is that Washington has positioned itself so centrally in this narrative that the heightened policy variance is bound to retard the natural recovery in growth and employment even more than usual.  We say around this table often that policy needs to be anchored, and the reaction function of policymakers needs to be clearly understood for policy to be effective.  Well, that\u2019s not unique to monetary policy, and there are real implications of this kind of variance for regulatory policy, fiscal policy, and trade policy.  And in that I would reference what Governor Kohn said about the state of policies everywhere else around the world.  All of this, I think, makes the job ahead for us in predicting the turn in the real economy and the inflation prospects very significant.  So let me give a couple of examples.   First, regulatory policy, which again Don referenced.  Without assigning particular merit to policy proposals, the changing goalposts of what is being billed as comprehensive, fundamental regulatory reform strike me as not helpful to the financial architecture.  Financial firms, perhaps more than other sectors, need policy to be anchored.  This may be even more important than that it\u2019s optimally decided.  And if the credit channel to small businesses, which is going to be so important for job creation, is having a harder time taking advantage of highly accommodative policies and putting them into action, we run grave risks of delaying the onset of meaningful job growth in the recovery.  Over the medium term this could lead to a higher NAIRU if uncertainty drives more-persistent structural unemployment, but I think in the short term it could really have grave risks for the transition happening in the real economy. Second, let me turn to fiscal policy and the questions of variance.  Market participants appear to be every bit reevaluating sovereign risks across a number of countries.  The recognition of large off-balance-sheet, contingent liabilities could make ratios of official debt to GDP move higher virtually overnight.  Now, recognizing that this is arithmetic, these off-balance-sheet liabilities\u2014whether you\u2019re thinking in the United States of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or you\u2019re thinking of the European Union of what would happen if Greece weren\u2019t to do the right things\u2014markets could come to view sovereign risks differently.  I suspect that sovereign debt markets are likely to be subjected to higher volatility until policy questions are answered, and the potential for nonlinear outcomes is real.  As I have said before, if Dubai is about Dubai, and Greece is about Greece, and Fannie and Freddie are about Fannie and Freddie, then we have nothing to worry about. Okay.  The second question\u2014Who knew that free money would be so popular.  I\u2019ll talk about two things:  financial markets and inflation.  If you think broadly about the intermeeting period\u2014and maybe I would have to except the last week or two, when financial market prices seem to have leveled out and fallen and seem to have become a little more discriminating, which is generally a good thing\u2014it still looks as though high-yield and leveraged-loan spreads and credit spreads generally continue to trend lower.  Volatility measures are up since we last met, so that if you look at the VIX and at some measures of volatility in the credit markets, I think there is further upside risk in the volatility of asset prices separate and apart from what their actual levels ought to be, which has caused me to further mark down my estimates of GDP and employment growth in the forecast period. What about inflation prospects.  I think I share what I have heard to be a bit of an emerging and concerning consensus.  That is, while I would note personally that the dollar sank relative to the euro, dollar stability broadly against foreign currencies is an encouraging sign and should help mitigate some of the trends on import prices, but it\u2019s hard for me to ignore the move in nonfuel commodity prices, and it bears watching much as others have said.  The trend of some of these inflation measures, particularly in a constellation of policy uncertainty around fiscal policy here and everywhere around the world and the misperception that somehow this policy uncertainty will affect the Federal Reserve, which is something that I think all of us will fight vigorously against, does raise the question about inflation expectations and puts a special burden on all of us.  If policy rates were to stay as accommodative as the Greenbook suggests, given these policy uncertainties, I would be surprised if inflation and inflation expectations stayed at levels consistent with price stability in the forecast period.  Thank you", " MR. WARSH.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, one question on paragraph 2, the inflation paragraph.  What do you think is the difference in the language that is proposed in alternative B, \u201cinflation is likely to be subdued,\u201d versus the language I think we used for a while \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cinflation is expected to be subdued\u201d.  Is that supposed to be revealing a little less certainty, or is that thought to be consistent", " MR. PLOSSER.  No, no, no.  I thought we were starting the go-round", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will make just a few brief comments.  I support alternative B with certain changes.  One caveat would be this holdings issue.  I would support substituting \u201choldings\u201d for \u201cpurchases.\u201d  I think it is a more accurate description of where we are in the cycle here.  We are almost done with our purchases, and to have the statement say that we are continuing to evaluate our purchases makes it sound as though maybe we would extend our purchases further, or something like that, which I don\u2019t think reflects the intention of the Committee here.  We do intend to end this program, and we do intend to then evaluate our holdings.  So I think that that would be a better way to go. As I have in previous meetings, I support paragraph 2 from alternative C, as President Plosser did, which gives more-direct control over medium-term inflation as a result of what the Committee does as opposed to external factors, and that is why I like that type of statement better. In the fourth paragraph, on the question of the TAF, I would support including the language \u201ctwenty-eight-day credit at the final auction on March 8,\u201d and delete the rest of the sentence, because that also seems to reflect the sentiment of the Committee.  And that would tie up our liquidity programs all more or less at the same time, which I think is helpful to us.  We are saying that financial conditions have improved markedly and therefore we don\u2019t need the special programs that we had before, although of course we stand prepared, if turmoil should return, to implement those programs again in the future. Yesterday\u2019s discussion suggested consensus on returning to an all-Treasuries balance sheet at some point.  I think there are definitely issues around the table about how fast and when to start on that project.  There was a lot of discussion also about asset sales at some point to help with this process, and I garnered a sense from many members\u2014and I think\u2014that redemptions alone are just going to be too slow.  It is going to leave too many MBS on our balance sheet for too long a period.  So I think we should do more in future statements to reflect the outcome of that discussion, and that is something we should work on at the next meeting and going forward, because that needs to be communicated accurately to financial markets. I also think there is more state-contingency in our plans around the table than what is perceived in financial markets, and I think we could do more to communicate that as well.  I do think that we could achieve something closer to optimum monetary policy by adjusting our balance sheet program in response to economic developments.  Some people expressed the concern that we would be adjusting all the time in response to maybe what some would think of as small developments with respect to the economy.  But when it\u2019s interest rate policy, we make a judgment at every meeting about what direction we want to go.  And we do try to give guidance to the markets about our future direction with respect to interest rate policy.  I see no reason that we can\u2019t do something similar with balance sheet policy.  We have a baseline in place.  We project out a baseline.  We communicate that to markets, but we adjust it going forward, which I think is what actually most people have in mind, except that most people seem to want to have a high bar with respect to any adjustments or any changes. For you nerds here, I am not quite sure why our optimal balance sheet policy is analogous to an sS-type inventory control policy.  I mean, why not adjust small amounts.  We do small word changes and so on at each meeting.  I don\u2019t see why policy couldn\u2019t be tweaked, stretched out, moved up, faster purchases or faster sales, depending on the situation.  Sticking to a mechanistic approach to balance sheet adjustment is okay, but I also think that it puts a lot of pressure on the expected date of the return to traditional interest rate targeting, so the main way that we would have impact on policy over the next year or year and a half is that we would start talking about that developments were positive in the intermeeting period and, therefore, probabilistically speaking, we would be moving up the date of the return to traditional interest rate targeting.  Or if the data were bad, then, probabilistically speaking, we would be moving back the date of the first move. I am not quite sure what impact that really has, and I think that it is not that clear a way to run policy during the period over the next eighteen months or so before whenever we do get to the date when we want to raise rates.  That, in my view, is not the best way to conduct policy.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly clear.  And I think going the mechanistic route undermines our claim that quantitative easing has been effective.  If it has been effective, then it should also be effective as a tool going forward, and it\u2019s not clear to me why the Committee wants to forgo the use of that tool in this particular circumstance.  Thank you", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Part of the consensus that I have heard here today is that economic and financial conditions have improved steadily in recent months and that this is obviously due in part to some very stimulative monetary policy.  Although the convictions vary around this table, we are all projecting improved economic growth.  And, yes, unemployment is too high.  Part of that is structural.  And if we wait until it is low enough to satisfy everyone, we will delay actions that I think are necessary.  In my view, President Bullard, uncertainty is always above average in a bust and always below average in a boom.  [Laughter]  That is the problem.  So I think we need to think about that, because in this period, uncertainty impedes actions that I think are necessary.  We have had language of reassurance regarding low rates for nearly a year, even though circumstances are considerably different than they were a year ago.  My point is that we need to turn more deliberately to more-aggressive thinking about our long-run issues. There are three risks that I am concerned about.  The first, and perhaps most important, is a commitment to near-zero rates for an extended period.  It lays the new foundations as the economy recovers for future financial imbalances, and I think this is where we are in danger.  In my experience, artificially low rates for an extended period invite resource misallocations.  No matter the upside data, we will not reverse policy significantly or quickly.  It\u2019s just our experience.  As this occurs, and we use this \u201cextended period\u201d language, we have handcuffed ourselves for any action for at least six to nine months it would seem.  Maybe not.   Another risk is that we are seeing and will experience significant borrowing needs of the federal government.  This will, as our economy continues to improve, put upward pressure on real rates, and therefore we are in this handcuffed position. Third, as noted in the Bluebook, the combination of near-zero interest rates with the size of our balance sheet will cause long-term inflation expectations to systematically, over time, become less well anchored, I guess I\u2019ll say.  Thus, we need to change the forward guidance and cease our commitment to \u201cextended period\u201d language.  We should allow ourselves the flexibility to begin to raise rates modestly, not just let liquidity facilities rescind as the economy improves, assuming that it does continue to improve, and, if it doesn\u2019t, then we don\u2019t move.  The Bluebook recognizes part of this in terms of growth protection and the fact that we could have and should have higher rates.  And I would point out that an effort to move the fed funds rate to \u00bd or  percent is, if anything, accommodative.  It\u2019s not tight policy, and we should think about it, because the longer we wait, the more the resource allocation issues come up. Now, on the market, I certainly realize that changing the word \u201cextended\u201d may rattle the market, perhaps importantly, perhaps temporarily.  It depends on how we explain it and how we go forward.  But if we are going to remain handcuffed and we are going to remain committed to the markets\u2019 expectations that they define, then we are going to have future problems\u2014maybe not next year in this economy but in a future period as we have had in the past.  Therefore, I would very much prefer alternative C as we move forward.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I intimated yesterday, I see our exit strategy as composed of three phases, at least two of which overlap.  One is ending the special liquidity programs that we have.  Two is preparing, and including good communication of, a strategy for tightening.  And the third is the tightening itself.  And I do think there\u2019s an important distinction between two and three. I am bemused, I must say, at the certainty of some of the people around the table as to the robustness and pace of a recovery, particularly given a lot of the uncertainties that the Chairman noted in his summation.  My view, again, as expressed yesterday, is a concern that a signaling of tightening and a response in markets could unnecessarily choke off what is still an uneven and somewhat fragile recovery.  At the same time, my inclination, which has only been strengthened during this FOMC meeting, is that when the time for tightening comes, it is probably going to have to be multi-tool and it may well have to be pretty muscular in order to achieve the efficacy that we are going to be looking for. The public and markets are looking much more at changes in the language that we have than in how new language might be read on its own in isolation.  So that makes me, like a number of others of you, disinclined toward any changes that might appear to be signaling a moving from phase 2 to phase 3.  So I guess I\u2019m not looking to indicate that we are gradually moving toward the exit if that means tightening.  And it\u2019s for that reason that I endorsed Charlie Plosser\u2019s idea yesterday of just ending the liquidity programs as quickly as we can.  Let\u2019s say we have done it, and we have completed that phase. For all of these reasons, I favor alternative B, both the action and most of the language.  I favor inclusion of the language that Bill English suggested on the TAF because I think that it pursues Charlie\u2019s goal of wrapping all of this up.  But I oppose the substitution of \u201choldings\u201d for \u201cpurchases,\u201d not because it\u2019s not potentially a useful way to begin changing the language.  I think Narayana proposes it with the intention of ongoing neutrality.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be read by markets right now.  They are just going to invest it with way more significance than most of us at least would intend.  And on the inflation language, I defer to you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. PLOSSER.  My point is that our holdings are being affected by both purchases and redemptions.  And so getting back to the debate about \u201choldings\u201d versus \u201cpurchases,\u201d we are not just purchasing, we are also redeeming", " MR. PLOSSER.  One question:  What the sentence says is \u201cto warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\u201d  The market seems to interpret that as being that we don\u2019t move at all.  Yet we could move 50 basis points and still have exceptionally low interest rates.  So in your view, what is the interaction between \u201cextended period\u201d and \u201cexceptionally low\u201d.  Should we be interpreting it as no move or that we may be moving up slowly", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  There are also some operational issues.  How do you roll into bills.  There may not be a bill auction on the right day, and so there are some complexities"], "2010FOMC20100316meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  I have a couple of questions.  First, on the Treasury redemptions, I\u2019m struck that this is brought to us in isolation.  At the last meeting we talked about a range of strategies and a range of sequencing, and yet here you\u2019re asking us to think about this in isolation.  You folks say there is something like a 10 to 15 basis point effect on yields.  What if I said, \u201cLet\u2019s not redeem Treasuries but sell an equivalent amount, follow an equivalent path, of MBS\u201d.  What would the effect on yields be", " MR. SACK.  Right.  But there was conditionality attached to the purchase program.  And I think the issue in a program of sales is this:  If the Committee would want that same kind of conditionality and flexibility, that may be seen as a risk factor to the markets, and they may price some risk of more rapid sales that would be more disruptive. That\u2019s the issue.  We\u2019ve talked about this in past meetings, namely, that redemptions in some way are a commitment device to shed the portfolio only gradually.  And if you could achieve something equivalent through commitments, presumably you could do something similar through asset sales", " MR. SACK.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s infeasible, but I think you have a tradeoff between wanting to retain flexibility and at the same time creating a perceived risk, at least, in the markets", " MR. LACKER.  More broadly, I\u2019m drawn to the idea of thinking about what reserve balance path we want and then choosing among a variety of ways to achieve that.  I\u2019d feel more comfortable thinking about redemptions in that context. Regarding the RCAs, last week one of the GSEs, Fannie Mae, announced that it was dropping something like a dozen or so counterparties from its list of counterparties.  To me, this seems problematic for the theory of the usefulness of reserve collateral accounts, because the theory is that risk considerations lead the GSEs to limit the number of counterparties, and yet that\u2019s costly to them because the resulting diminution of competition leads them to earn less on their invested funds.  So here they are voluntarily shedding a bunch of counterparties, which presumably is going to lead to their earning less on their funds.  And this is happening in an environment in which the broad trend is that institutions are getting less risky, not more.  Some of these institutions are less risky than institutions that are still on their counterparty list.  So I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019d square that observation with your theory", " MR. LACKER.  The theory is all built on this restriction to the number of counterparties.  I don\u2019t see how arbitrarily adding counterparties is going to improve their competitive position in the model you wrote down, right.  I just don\u2019t see how they\u2019re unrelated. Another observation that I think is relevant here is that, at the same time, Fannie Mae approached a large Carolina-based institution to increase the amount of overnight fed funds lending it would do with the institution from $500 million to $5 billion, and Fannie Mae is doing this at 5 basis points.  This isn\u2019t brokered, so it doesn\u2019t enter the effective fed funds calculation, but I noticed that yesterday\u2019s expected fed funds rate was around 20 basis points.  To me, this suggests that there\u2019s a lot of other stuff going on in the market:  First, that leverage constraints could well be binding\u2014there\u2019s something limiting banks\u2019 willingness to bid aggressively for funds to drive up the rate that Fannie Mae pays; second, that there\u2019s some sort of relationship\u2014people do business with Fannie Mae across a broad array of products and services, so the funds rate might not be a particularly market-driven rate or a rate determined in isolation.  I also note that GSEs are active in the repo market and have an effect there and have the ability to arbitrage those two choices.  And the funds rate is at about the same level as the RP rate. More broadly, I think we ought to take two steps back and ask why we care about the effective funds rate.  The staff mentions two reasons.  One is as a measure of banks\u2019 marginal opportunity cost of funds.  If that\u2019s the purpose it was serving well before the crisis, let\u2019s take a step back and ask how to measure that.  Presumably, there still exists a bank\u2019s marginal opportunity cost of funds.  The natural question seems to be, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t IOER the best estimate of that\u201d.  The staff also mentions a tighter link to IOER.  I\u2019m not quite sure why we care about that per se.  Our quantitative easing has driven down market rates, so you\u2019d expect a broad array of market rates, including RP rates, to be driven down, and that pulls down the fed funds rate. I\u2019m not sure why we want a technical measure to undo that. We have the effective fed funds rate, a measure of bank\u2019s marginal opportunity cost of funds, and dramatic changes in the policy regime make that a much less perfect measure.  It seems that we\u2019re trying to make a structural fix in order to get that measure what it used to measure.  I think it makes more sense to take a step back and ask, \u201cHow do we want to measure this best.\u201d If you look at the effective fed funds rate mechanism, too, it\u2019s sort of antiquated.  We take rate and volume data from a set of brokers\u2014it\u2019s just a fraction of the market\u2014and the volume is relatively small.  People can move transactions out of brokers or into brokers and affect the rate.  I heard a rumor that Citibank is unwilling to take trades through brokers at less than 10 basis points, but they\u2019ll do it if you call them up.  I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about. If we really want to measure the funds rate more accurately, we could ask for everybody to report all fed funds trades, right.  We could put a new transaction code in Fedwire.  So this just doesn\u2019t seem to be solving the right problem, and that\u2019s my reaction to the RCAs", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So if the difference between the IOER rate and the market rate doesn\u2019t matter, then we should just raise the IOER rate and ignore all of these reserve-draining issues.  Yes", " MR. EVANS.  I just don\u2019t see that channel between markets in your analysis.  That was my basic point.  It seems to me like the competitive channel is blocked because the funds rate channel is still largely a slack constraint.  Maybe as interest rates go up, it would tend to bite a little bit more", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I want to tie the two together because I actually am concerned not by the presenter, Brian, but by the content of his presentation.  As exhibit 2 shows, all of those things we set out to accomplish, we did and we did well.  Central bankers should never pat themselves on the back, but I think those are all positive outcomes.  What bothers me is exhibit 4, chart 19.  According to the memo Brian sent out earlier, we will wind up with 69 percent of our portfolio concentrated\u2014I\u2019m talking about the asset side of our balance sheet\u2014in GSE securities. Mr. Chairman, you expressed this eloquently in your testimony, and all of us have repeated it, and, Brian, you repeated it this morning.  You used the word \u201cultimately.\u201d  I\u2019m wondering when \u201cultimately\u201d is in terms of getting back to having an all-Treasury portfolio.  We\u2019re stuck with a massive portfolio of GSEs.  Speaking personally, I don\u2019t want to be there at all.  I\u2019m concerned that we have somehow avoided the question; and, in fact, through statements that are being made before we have complete unanimity at this table or at least agreement at this table, we\u2019re saying we\u2019re not going to be selling GSE securities until we raise rates and other things to that effect.  This little yellow section here in that chart and even more dramatically in the table and the pictures you provided in your briefing memo raise my question:  When is \u201cultimately\u201d. Second, in the excellent briefings you\u2019ve provided and the Board briefing that was provided yesterday, which was superb, we note that there\u2019s pent-up demand for GSE securities.  We\u2019ve taken that market away.  So my question is:  If most managers are underweight MBS, why don\u2019t we sell to them and take advantage of it.  I\u2019m all for Treasury redemptions, by the way, but why are we, in a sense, putting Treasuries before MBS.  That doesn\u2019t make sense to me.  I\u2019d be interested in the Desk\u2019s answer.  If, indeed, we have pent-up investor demand, would you give us some sense of how serious that is. I also have a comment that links to the issue of RCAs.  RCAs have the benefits that have been outlined.  But I\u2019m also looking at some of the negatives, which you point out in your paper.  It will probably shrink the federal funds market.  That diminishes the role of the FOMC to a degree, at least given the way we used to operate.  And a super cynic would say not only were the GSEs accomplices to the housing and financial crisis\u2014we were cleaning up that mess by buying up that portfolio, as we have particularly in two areas of the maturities spectrum; we are at 80 percent of the market\u2014but now we\u2019re also handmaidens to cleaning up, in a sense, the mess they are creating in the fed funds market. So I\u2019m very uncomfortable\u2014and I want to get this out up front\u2014with the buildup in GSE holdings.  I\u2019d like to get a sense from the Desk of what is the resolution and what does the word \u201cultimately\u201d mean.  Second, I want to suggest that we go very slowly on this RCA concept.  There\u2019s a key statement in the very good paper that you wrote, where you say this is a \u201cpermanent modification to the reserve account framework.\u201d  A permanent modification to the reserve account framework to me warrants, Mr. Chairman, a great deal more discussion than just saying \u201cgo ahead and continue the process.\u201d  I have mostly made a statement, but I have also asked a question.  Brian, when is \u201cultimately.\u201d  When do we get out of this stuff.  And do you think it\u2019s wise, operating the Desk, for us to end up in 2014 with 69 percent of our assets invested in mortgage-backed securities", " MR. FISHER.  And I don\u2019t want to take too much time because we do have to run against the clock, Mr. Chairman, but it seems to me that the tone at the table has been \u201chold back on sales of mortgage-backed securities until we raise rates,\u201d and I don\u2019t believe that has been agreed at the table.  This is a derivative of the broader issue, which is the MBS, and I guess I should say I\u2019m uncomfortable with question number four.  I don\u2019t have a problem with the first three questions, but for number four, I\u2019d say \u201cWhoa, Nelly", " MR. HOENIG.  I think the discussion in April would be very good because the goal for me is to get the excess reserve levels down as quickly as possible.  So I\u2019m very much in favor of Treasury redemptions and also the systematic sale of the mortgage-backed securities to the extent the market can handle it without being disrupted.  So that, I think, is the most important element that we can have as a discussion item. On the RCAs, I do associate myself a little bit with President Lacker and President Evans.  I see it as more of a transfer than really a competitive enhancer into the market.  The enhancement is by giving the guarantee\u2014you basically transfer earnings over to the GSEs.  They\u2019ve chosen to narrow their scope in terms of whom they\u2019ll have as a counterparty.  That\u2019s their choice.  I don\u2019t know that we need to get involved in that.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to gather that much more information, especially if we focus on getting the excess reserves down as quickly as possible.  So I\u2019ll leave it at that", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We\u2019re going to have to withdraw hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves at the time we begin to raise the short-term rate.  I don\u2019t see any way to sell hundreds of billions of dollars of MBS without having very sharp implications for longer-term rates and for mortgage rates.  I think it is much safer to use the reserve-draining mechanism in the short run and to have a path, an announced path, for selling MBS over the medium term.  That would be my personal preference, and I\u2019ve stated it as my preference.  If you disagree with that, of course, you are free to say so.  Maybe the best thing is for all of us to make sure that we emphasize that there is still discussion going on in the Committee about the issue", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At my directors\u2019 meeting last week, the most commonly used adjective to describe the economy was \u201cflat.\u201d  The Greenbook is estimating first-quarter final sales at 1.6 percent, which is roughly the same pace of final sales growth we experienced in the second half of 2009, and it certainly seems consistent with the qualitative assessment of a flat economy. While the Greenbook and my own forecast assume a gradual increase in momentum, there is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecast.  In particular, it is hard to be confident that private demand will offset the reduction in overall fiscal stimulus as well as the end of targeted fiscal programs, such as the first-time homebuyers\u2019 program, and our own program of purchasing mortgage-backed securities.  It is worrisome that housing seems to have stalled in the first quarter, even before the monetary and fiscal programs that were supporting the sector have ended.  Coupled with continuing problems in commercial real estate, the outlook remains dim for those in construction trades who are hoping to be hired. These problems are quite apparent in the employment statistics.  Men in the age category of 20 to 24 years currently have an unemployment rate of 18.7 percent, 5 percentage points higher than women.  Of course, transitory movements in and out of the labor force can add measurement error to the unemployment rate.  To avoid these difficulties, one can examine the employment\u2013population ratio.  But the employment\u2013population ratio for these prime-age males portrays the same qualitative picture as the unemployment rate.  Its decline is striking\u2014far larger than in the previous three recessions, even when one includes adjustments for the significant demographic shifts over the past decades.  This group has been particularly hard hit by the dramatic decline in construction and manufacturing jobs, but is a group that would certainly be rehired if the economic recovery were more rapid.  I would also note that the adjusted employment\u2013population ratio has shown a fairly reliable link to inflation, and its implications for the inflation outlook are not reassuring.  While layoffs have been subsiding, business confidence has not improved to where businesses are doing significant hiring.  Anecdotal stories complement the employment report that indicates improvements in hiring of temporary workers, but continued hesitance in hiring permanent workers until the recovery is more firmly established. As for inflation, the trend of lower core prices continues, and the Greenbook has lowered its forecast for core PCE inflation to only 1 percent at the end of 2011.  The recent behavior of compensation suggests that this trend is not yet at an end.  The Boston staff model finds that the recent wage deceleration is well explained by low inflation expectations and significant labor market slack, partly offset by rapid productivity growth.  Interestingly, the one-year inflation expectations implied by the model are currently below 1 percent.  That model suggests subdued wage growth throughout the forecast horizon and a continued decline in core inflation, even as short-run inflation expectations return toward their 2 percent anchor over several years.  I would also note that deflation rather than inflation has become a problem in Japan, and many European countries are reporting very subdued core prices, particularly countries such as Spain and Ireland, which have been severely impacted by the financial crisis. The problems in Europe highlight a continued downside risk.  Problems with sovereign risks have the potential to be amplified through the banking system.  According to data from DTC, the three largest net sellers of credit default swaps to Greece are financial institutions that have exposures ranging from $690 million to $990 million, and one of the three is a large U.S. financial institution.  Greece is a relatively small country, but a crisis of confidence in firms and governments and peripheral countries in Europe could raise the possibility of once again creating problems at highly leveraged institutions.  We should be particularly alert to problems in countries such as Spain, with its high unemployment rate, falling housing prices, and banks reliant on wholesale financing. While the brunt of the problems would be centered in Europe, we would certainly not be immune.  While I expect that Europe will be able to resolve these problems without a large negative shock, the risk of such shocks at a time when our recovery is still anemic and our policy tools limited bears careful monitoring.  While the economy is recovering, it is both a slow and fragile recovery.  I expect that it will be some time before we can have much confidence that the recovery has firmly taken hold. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The level of economic activity in the Eighth District is slowly improving, although reports remain mixed as manufacturing activity has increased in these months and firms continue to report that they are reluctant to hire.  Contacts indicated that the level of retail sales in the District was lower in January and early February when compared with one year ago.  However, most retailers were optimistic for March and April.  Residential real estate markets in the District continue to be weak, but appear to have stabilized.  The pace of home sales, for instance, remains about the same as it was one year ago.  Commercial and industrial real estate markets continue to struggle.  Contacts in the District\u2019s transportation industry were generally positive, reporting volume increases that suggest a sustained recovery and strengthening across categories, regions, and internationally. My sense is that the economic recovery remains on track.  Nationally, business capital spending continues to trend upward, as discussed earlier, which I find encouraging.  Households seem to be returning slowly to more normal consumption patterns.  I expect the U.S. labor markets to show improvement soon, very soon, I hope.  Failure to see job creation in the next few months would be a significant worry.  We\u2019ve waited a long time and had a long stretch of negative numbers; I would expect that to turn around this spring.  Continuing expansion in Asia seems to be helping U.S. firms, including many in the Eighth District.  One risk to the forecast is possible derailment of that expansion.  China, in particular, may be susceptible to a crisis event.  It\u2019s a concern to me, and I think we should be prepared to adjust policy should that scenario unfold in the next year or so.  The pace of projected growth in Europe seems very slow to me relative to the U.S., and, certainly compared with Asia, momentum seems very weak.  A stagnant Europe also seems like a risk to the broader recovery in my view. U.S. inflation trends are subdued.  Risks to inflation in the U.S. in the medium term rest on how finely calibrated our ultra-easy monetary policy is in reaction to a very severe recession, and I\u2019m not sure how good our calibration really is.  TIPS-based expected inflation measures fell modestly during the past week.  I interpret this as markets pricing in some probability of a return to more volatile financial markets in response to sovereign debt issues around the globe. I put a low probability on the scenario that renewed financial market turmoil will materialize near the levels of the last 18 months.  As I see it, for better or worse, governments have shown that they\u2019re willing to back the largest financial institutions internationally and, therefore, I think we\u2019re not susceptible to the same type of turmoil that we saw a little more than a year ago.  Those government guarantees remain in place. I\u2019m concerned about the influence of the shelter component in measures of inflation.  Prices in this area are more reflective of excess supply conditions in housing markets than they are of underlying inflation trends.  They are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.  The core CPI inflation rate without shelter is running at about 3 percent, measuring from one year ago.  Of course, it\u2019s completely arbitrary to throw out components of the price index, but, unfortunately, we do it all the time.  Our core measures of inflation exclude food and energy, which gives shelter a large role in the story on inflation at this time.  A better approach, in my view, is simply to use the headline price index, which, I admit, can be volatile.  These are the prices that people actually have to pay.  Thank you", " MR. LOCKHART.  Actually, I do have something to say.  In our conversations with directors over the past two weeks, the most common characterization of the economy in the Sixth District was fragile.  We detected some improving optimism, but this optimism is tempered by concern and uncertainty about top-line prospects, policy coming out of the Congress, worsening problems of state and local government, and the commercial real estate exposure to the banking sector. The Sixth District\u2019s outlook narrative is broadly consistent with the Greenbook, but Atlanta\u2019s forecast remains weaker than the Greenbook, stemming in large part from our assumption of a slower pace of business investment.  Over the last two weeks, we focused our inquiries to directors and their contacts on this assumption.  We heard that inventories are being managed to unusually lean levels, and businesses seem committed to tighter inventory ratios on an indefinite basis, in some cases even at the expense of sales.  We also heard a good deal about advancements in just-in-time supply capability on the part of most domestic and foreign suppliers.  This feedback casts some doubt on the prospects for much near-term GDP contribution from inventory replenishment.  We also detected from our Sixth District contacts very restrained intention to invest in equipment and software or nonresidential structures beyond maintenance levels.  This anecdotal feedback produces some cautious skepticism regarding the Greenbook forecast of strong economic growth and expenditure on equipment and software.  Our contacts also conveyed a strong hesitance to hire, and their opinion was that, where investment is occurring, it is labor-replacing.  One contact also noted the renewal of offshoring activity.  We heard through directors that many business people seem to be talking about potential inflation, but few appear to be acting on this concern.  There is a widespread assessment that pricing power remains very weak. Regarding inflation, it\u2019s hard for me to summon much concern about inflation in the immediate future.  Almost all measures of core inflation show indications of disinflation, and inflation expectations continue to strike me as stable. Finally, I see the growth risks as pretty balanced.  Not one Atlanta or Branch director expressed the opinion that growth in their businesses would be slower in the next six months versus the past six months.  At the same time, as I noted, they characterize the economy as extremely fragile and the recovery as tentative and held back by uncertainties.  These reports capture what I perceive to be an encouraging but inconclusive real economy picture at this juncture.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The most recent published data for the Fifth Federal Reserve District continue to show a lethargic recovery.  For example, our surveys of manufacturing and service sector activity were tepid in February.  Within the last few weeks, however, the tone of the information flow has begun to improve noticeably.  Several of my directors have reported positive unexpected developments that occurred in recent weeks, such as IT suppliers beginning to hire temporary workers to fulfill rising demand.  In addition, a preliminary tally of responses for our March survey has found improvements in a number of categories.  For example, our manufacturing shipments index was zero last month, but the preliminary March reading is 8, and the retail sales index was a minus 15 last month, while the preliminary March reading is 5.  These indexes are often choppy, of course, and the February readings were likely held down by the snow.  Still the improvements are striking, especially in conjunction with the better anecdotes we\u2019re hearing. Turning to the national outlook, the Greenbook responded appropriately to the soggy information flow by marking down the current quarter GDP growth forecast by 0.6 percentage point.  In addition, the staff lowered the projected growth rate of real GDP through the end of next year.  I do agree with the staff that it makes sense to mark down the near-term outlook.  The downward revisions to previously published employment and income levels were striking, and the housing market appears to have stalled out.   That said, I\u2019m not so sure that the latest data warrant pulling down the forecast of growth a year or more ahead.  Consumer spending still appears to be expanding at a reasonable pace despite the substantial strains many households must be experiencing, and housing is such a small part of the economy now that flat residential investment isn\u2019t much of a drag on economic growth.  Besides, this is likely to continue to be a somewhat choppy recovery for some time, and I think we should be careful not to over-interpret or perhaps over-extrapolate month-to-month forecast misses.  I haven\u2019t pulled down my longer-term forecast just yet, and I still think that there\u2019s a reasonable chance that growth will come in above our baseline projection.  If growth does surprise on the upside, we\u2019ll probably want to begin to normalize policy sooner, perhaps a lot sooner than the Greenbook assumes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook for GDP growth remains somewhat below the Greenbook baseline forecast for both this year and next, and I don\u2019t expect the unemployment rate to fall below 9 percent until mid-2011.  My weaker output growth and higher unemployment profile resembles a combination of the Greenbook\u2019s lower-potential-output and persistent-caution scenarios.  In my outlook, unprecedented levels of long-term unemployment lead to a weaker recovery in output growth along the lines of the Greenbook\u2019s lower-potential-output scenario. Past experiences with very long-lived unemployment spells indicate that workers lose valuable human capital during their unemployment that is not recovered for years after the unemployment spell ends.  The clearest evidence for these losses is research that examined the consequences of permanent job losses in Pennsylvania in the wake of the severe shake-out in the steel industry during the 1980s.  Unfortunately, many of today\u2019s long-term unemployed could suffer a similar fate, which, when added up over millions of people, accumulates to a lower level of potential output.  The loss of human capital is likely to be extended for some time, as I\u2019m also seeing early evidence of a jobless recovery.  The past two recoveries were characterized by low job-finding rates, and that pattern seems to be repeating itself in the current recovery.  The comments that I\u2019ve been hearing from a range of business people have indicated few plans for hiring in the coming year, as many have already mentioned.  This has been particularly the case for large groups of small businesses that we\u2019ve been meeting with throughout the District during the past couple of months.  Overall, what I\u2019m hearing is that it\u2019s likely that the unemployment duration is set to grow even longer. I also find the Greenbook\u2019s persistent-caution scenario consistent with widespread reports that I\u2019m hearing from both households and businesses in my District.  The sheer magnitude of the recession caught many by surprise and has instilled a heightened sense of caution in both households and businesses.  This is evident in a range of sentiment indicators, but perhaps most telling in households\u2019 expectations for their own income growth.  The Michigan survey has included that question for years, and households reliably answered that they expected their incomes to grow about 3 percent or more, even in recession years.  Since March of 2009, respondents are now anticipating near zero growth in their income.  With these types of expectations for no income growth, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019re going to see the elevated saving rate continue beyond the current year. Businesses that have made it through this recession, with a few exceptions, are just as cautious in their investment and hiring plans.  Most of the CEOs that I talk to from large and small companies say that there\u2019s just way too much uncertainty out there, uncertainty over health care reform, energy, environmental, and tax policies.  As President Fisher commented, the CEOs claim that uncertainty is so great that it\u2019s causing them either to delay investments or to divert them to countries where uncertainty is much lower.  It\u2019s not a ringing endorsement of our country when I hear these executives say that they see China and India as a lower-risk investment climate. Shifting to the inflation outlook, the incoming data on consumer prices highlight significant downward pressure on pricing, as many have already commented.  I\u2019ll add one more data point.  The Cleveland trimmed mean and median CPI series have both been on a disinflationary path since mid-2008.  Looking at the distribution of price changes, more than 40 percent of the consumer\u2019s market basket has been exhibiting outright price decreases over the last six months.  This is somewhat striking considering that during the 2003 period, in which we were worried about falling prices, that phenomenon occurred only once.  This tendency for core inflation to head lower is gradually offset in my projection by the effects of lower potential output and anchored inflation expectations, which, in my forecast begin to push inflation higher in 2011. Overall the risks around my outlook for output growth remain balanced, with my business contacts citing a range of potential downside risks that are offset by the fact that pessimism does tend to dominate at similar points in recoveries, and then we\u2019ve been surprised with growth to the upside.  In terms of inflation, with core inflation rates edging lower and our limited options for further policy responses, I\u2019m now leaning towards the inflation risks in my forecast being slightly to the downside.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019ll focus my remarks on four elements of the current economic situation: conditions in the Ninth District, national labor market conditions, the inflation outlook, and conditions in financial markets.  The first two feed into my current thinking about our policy on interest rates, and the last two feed into my current thinking about the balance sheet. Throughout the Ninth District, businesses generally report that they do not anticipate making further cuts in production and employment.  However, they generally do not see a need to expand either in terms of capital or labor.  The possible exception may be Minnesota.  Businesses in Minnesota, especially those with foreign markets, report seeing increases in demand in the latter part of 2009 and anticipate more increases in the first half of 2010.  Some of the Minnesota contacts report that temporary hiring in the manufacturing sector has increased, although there are few, if any, plans to undertake permanent hires. Let me turn to the national labor market.  Nationally the unemployment rate in February, as we all know, remained elevated at 9.7 percent.  I think the data on labor turnover from the JOLTS survey continue to be troubling.  The hiring rate began to fall in early 2007 before the credit crisis and reached a historical low in early 2009.  The January 2010 hiring rate remains near this historical low.  It\u2019s true that employment losses have stabilized over the past several months, but only because the separation rate has also declined to historical lows.  Solid job creation can only take place when the hiring rate starts to increase.  One bright spot in the JOLTS data is that the job openings rates did tick upwards in January.  But my view is that we\u2019re not meeting the employment part of our joint mandates either nationally or in the Ninth District. I turn next to the outlook for inflation.  Both realizations and expectations of inflation remain well within desired ranges.  Nonetheless I do continue to be concerned that our large balance sheet, combined with the large federal debt, implies that we face a low-probability risk of high inflation.  One way to get a market measure of this risk is to look at the prices of options that pay off if 10-year Treasury yields rise by significant amounts over the coming three years.  These prices reveal that market participants see the risk of such an increase in Treasury yields as being highly elevated by historical standards, although I\u2019m happy to report that they have declined significantly since I joined this Committee [laughter]. Finally I turn to the condition of financial markets.  Corporate bond risk spreads and interbank lending spreads are at normal or below-normal levels.  Treasury and equity volatility are at near normal or below-normal levels.  Financial markets are now functioning much better than they were in late 2008 or early 2009.  As I emphasized at the last meeting, improvement in the conditions of financial markets is an important consideration when we turn to policy.  There are many forms of long-term, relatively riskless debt available for investors.  When markets are functioning poorly, cross-market arbitrages are difficult\u2014these different assets are essentially traded in distinct and relatively small markets\u2014so our interventions, either sales or purchases, will have big price effects in these conditions.  When markets are functioning well, as they are now, these roughly substitutable assets are traded in a single well-integrated market, so our interventions, either sales or purchases, will have only small price effects.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. 3 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the consensus view that the outlook has not changed much at all since the last meeting.  I\u2019d like to point out just two things.  Consumption is a bit stronger, but I think you also have to note that the compensation trend was revised down, so the saving rate is also lower, and that may exert some constraint on how fast consumption can continue to grow.  On the capital spending side, I think it\u2019s true that we\u2019re seeing some strength in technology spending, but I think, as others around the table have noted, policy does seem to be inhibiting the bigger kinds of investments\u2014for example, whether to locate a plant in the United States or overseas.  So I\u2019m not sure how big or sustainable this bounce in technology spending is going to be.  3 The materials referred to by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). In terms of risks to the outlook, I want to talk about two things.  I want to talk a little first about this issue of disinflation.  I handed out these two figures because I thought they were pretty good at getting at this whole issue of what\u2019s happening and how important shelter is in terms of the disinflation that we\u2019re seeing.  Figure 1 basically looks at core CPI inflation with and without shelter, and on both bases you\u2019re seeing disinflation.  Obviously, shelter is a big factor in terms of pushing down the level of the core so much, but I think you can\u2019t dismiss the low level of core just on the basis of shelter; and that\u2019s consistent with President Fisher\u2019s and others\u2019 remarks on the trimmed mean.  Figure 2 looks at what\u2019s happening to all of the components of the core PCE index prior to September 2008 and afterwards.  Looking at this chart, you see a lot of data points below the 45-degree line, and that implies that disinflation is broad.  It\u2019s interesting that the two dots that are the furthest above the 45-degree line are used motor vehicles and new motor vehicles; and the used motor vehicles, as Glenn pointed out to me when we were talking about it during the break, was partly due to the \u201ccash-for-clunkers\u201d program and what\u2019s happening in terms of its effects on the supply of used cars.  You\u2019ll also notice on this figure that the housing bubble, in red, does not really stand out relative to the other components.  So I think this tends to underscore the fact that the disinflation that we\u2019re seeing is pretty pervasive. The second thing I want to talk about very briefly is the fiscal sustainability issue.  I think it\u2019s a risk to the outlook.  I have two concerns.  The first concern is that when market participants become worried about fiscal sustainability in the U.S., they may start to price in bigger risk premiums, so long-term rates would go up.  And, the second concern is that, if that were to happen, it could actually provoke or necessitate earlier fiscal consolidation.  Either or both of those things would actually exert constraint on economic activity.  I think this risk can\u2019t be completely ruled out, given what we saw happening in Europe.  The Greece situation is clearly in a better place than it was six weeks ago, but a lot of other countries in Europe are in similar positions, and they have much more economic weight; and our own budgetary situation isn\u2019t very good either.  So the risk of contagion, perhaps from Europe to the U.K. and then on to the U.S., can\u2019t be completely ruled out. Both these risks\u2014disinflation and fiscal consolidation\u2014obviously underscore in my mind why it\u2019s very premature to tighten monetary policy now.  I\u2019m very much on the side of keeping stability right now in terms of the monetary policy course and the message that we\u2019re sending people.  But we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that in the monetary policy round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I have just one question.  I saw, in the Bluebook, that there is an analysis of the long-run scenarios for the balance sheet under alternative A and under alternative B.  I didn\u2019t understand the logic of not including such scenarios for alternative C.  If you could, please talk through that one", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been increased communication about our exit strategy\u2014I think this is a good thing\u2014but I think we\u2019re a bit hampered, because we really haven\u2019t decided upon yet as a Committee or reached a consensus on many of the facets of the exit strategy, which we\u2019ve just been alluding to, and I hope we\u2019ll continue to make progress on this important topic.  As I\u2019ve mentioned, our choices on the various elements of our exit strategy are all interrelated in some way, and we need to look at them collectively rather than as one-off. In particular, I think that we need to discuss further our longer-term operating framework, including the appropriate operating target, and that we need to do so in conjunction with the management of our asset holdings as we seek to shrink the size of reserves and move towards an all-Treasuries portfolio.  As the Chairman just indicated, I hope this will be an active discussion on the agenda in April so we can get a sense of where the Committee stands as we, so to speak, hone our exit strategies.  I think having a better idea of where we\u2019re going will help us decide how we exit. In general, we want our language to help us implement policy, not hinder us from implementing policy or inappropriately constrain us.  Given the economic outlook, I do think it\u2019s time for us to seriously consider backing away from the \u201cextended period\u201d language.  I would like our language to give us more flexibility with regard to policy than we currently have.  The forward guidance language, I believe, is beginning to become a hindrance rather than a help.  The longer we maintain it, the more difficult we may find it to unwind from it.  We will need to prepare the markets for the eventual start of our exit from this period of extraordinary policy accommodation. It\u2019s important for the public to understand that zero interest rates is not normal policy.  In fact, a 1 percent interest rate is not normal policy.  I view in many ways the start of moving rates up or selling assets from our portfolio not so much as a tightening in the usual sense of the word, but as a step towards normalization of policy in the same way that we\u2019re unwinding our liquidity facilities.  With the large size of our balance sheet and with rates at zero, policy will remain accommodative for a very long time to come after we start normalization. I like the idea of discussing some of our plans for exiting in our statement, but again, I think we need to be careful and choose language that will not become a constraint on us as we try to react to economic conditions.  This means being careful not to make commitments to a particular sequencing until we have more evidence on how our tools are working and how the economy is evolving.  We are in new territory.  We may find that we aren\u2019t able to maintain a particular sequencing and simultaneously meet our policy objectives.  From my perspective we ought to be trying to describe a reaction function that depends on the state of the economy to the extent we are able, not on something that looks like a mechanical set of actions that are a function of calendar time. It probably won\u2019t surprise anyone that I\u2019m in favor of alternative C\u2032, but with a couple of changes.  I would change the forward guidance in paragraph 3 to \u201csome time,\u201d period.  I oppose an additional clause that says \u201cat least through the end of the second quarter.\u201d  As I said, our policy needs to be contingent on the state of the economy, not on the calendar.  And I wouldn\u2019t be conveying that idea that it\u2019s tied to the calendar even if we thought economic conditions will likely mean that we won\u2019t be raising the target funds rate.  Again, I want the description in terms of the state of the economy, not in terms of the calendar. I had similar views to my colleagues, President Lacker and Fisher, regarding alternative C, paragraph 4:  I think the C\u2032 language is a little better.  I think President Hoenig\u2019s suggestions for the first sentence would be fine, but I do have some concern about whether that might be read as indicating that the Committee is going to act on bubbles, and that part of it makes me a little cautious.  However, in paragraph 4, I would not necessarily commit us to using tools for draining reserves before raising the IOER rate and the funds rate target.  I think this locks us in before we know how effective these tools will be; nor would I commit to saying that we\u2019re only considering possible gradual sales of assets from our portfolio or that they would only occur after we began to raise IOER rate.  Based on our previous discussions, it\u2019s not clear that these sequencing decisions represent any conclusions or consensus of the Committee. I would note here that I believe to a large degree that President Kocherlakota\u2019s view of the functioning of financial markets is correct.  In a market where longer-term and short-term rates are integrated and where we have an appropriately functioning term structure, there may not be much difference in the effect on longer-term interest rates of selling longer-term assets versus the expectation effects of beginning to raise the IOER rate and, through expectations of a tightening cycle, raising long-term rates; it\u2019s not clear how those two pieces could fit together.  I think those are the kinds of interactions we need to explore as we think about our exit strategy. Let me turn briefly to alternative B, because I don\u2019t think alternative C will be the consensus here.  As I\u2019ve discussed in previous meetings, I like the idea of conveying that it is monetary policy actions rather than structural features of the economy that influence inflation over the longer run.  Thus, I am strongly in favor of including the bracketed sentence in paragraph 2.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Okay", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m not in favor of alternative A.  I see no evidence that further expansion of the LSAP would be appropriate at this time.  However, I like elements of both alternatives B and C\u2032.  I like B because I believe the current high rate of unemployment and low levels of expected and realized inflation support continued use of the \u201cextended period\u201d language.  On the other hand, I\u2019m in favor of communicating our exit strategy immediately as is done in alternatives C and C\u2032.  I don\u2019t see a logical reason to wait to start communication until we drop the \u201cextended period\u201d language.  In terms of exit strategy, I liked C\u2032 better than C, without the language in blue type that\u2019s included in C\u2032.  I indicated in the economics go-round that I remain concerned about the inflationary risks of our large balance sheet.  Given those current concerns, I like C\u2032 because it allows the possibility of sales beginning before raising rates, although it does not necessarily require that. Likewise, C\u2032 is explicit about our desire to run off maturing and prepaid securities. Putting these thoughts together, I support alternative B with the inclusion of a new paragraph 4, which would be paragraph 4 of alternative C\u2032.  To be consistent with the rest of alternative B, I would change the first sentence in paragraph 4 to refer to \u201can extended period\u201d rather than \u201cfor some time.\u201d Keeping the Chairman\u2019s admonition about time in mind, but having been in favor of C\u2032, I have to say something about the exit strategy.  I will tax you with my thoughts on that, I hope briefly.  I think the Bluebook expressed some concerns that paragraphs like C\u2032 4 may generate uncertainty about our exit, and so may lead to untoward asset-market volatility.  I\u2019m very sympathetic to these concerns.  The right answer is not simply to avoid the topic entirely, as is done in alternative B, but rather to improve upon C\u2032 4 by being much less vague about our intentions.  For 2008 and 2009, the Committee was explicit about timing and quantities.  We should be explicit about timing and quantities during our exit. In my memo on reverse tapering, I offered one way to proceed.  One thing we should be actively considering is committing as much as possible to an end date and to a rate of sales. In the meeting last time, I think we said we all wanted to be out of the housing market and back into an all-Treasury portfolio eventually.  I would like to be explicit about what \u201ceventually\u201d means and state that we anticipate not having agency securities in our portfolio at the end of a given date\u2014I\u2019ll suggest 2016.  I\u2019m not wedded to 2016, but I strongly prefer it to be an end date in this decade as opposed to the 2020s or 2030s or President Rosengren\u2019s strategy, in which I think it would take until 2040 before we got out of agency MBS.  In terms of the speed of sales, I recommend we explicitly state that, through the end of 2016 or whatever end date we choose, the Federal Reserve would put a cap on sales.  I\u2019ll make another suggestion along these lines:  $25 billion of assets in a month. I think the big concern among market participants about our sales procedure is that, once we start selling, we\u2019ll go crazy and start to sell everything in a very short period of time.  I think we should commit to not being that kind of actor in the marketplace.  Now, I think that my proposed slow rate of sales would have little in the way of price impact, given the kind of financial market functioning we\u2019re seeing right now.  The results of the March 2010 working paper by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack were suggestive of such a notion.  In March of 2009, a year ago, the Fed announced the decision to buy up an additional $750 billion of agency MBS over the coming nine months.  The working paper estimates the impact of this purchase on agency MBS yields to have been about 30 basis points. I\u2019m proposing selling that same amount of agency MBS, or less, over a two-and-a-half-year period.  If financial markets are functioning much better, I would conjecture that the price effect of such sales would be considerably less than 30 basis points.  As I said, I propose an end date and a sales cap. Those would both be satisfied by 2016 at a pace of $25 billion a month, even if we wanted to wait to start to sell.  If we begin sales in mid-2011, 15 months from now\u2014we\u2019d like to start sooner\u2014but if we wanted to wait that long and sell $20 billion of MBS per month, that\u2019s inside the cap, we will eliminate agency securities from the balance sheet sometime in 2015.  This cap on sales would also imply that we would normalize reserve balances to a desirable level sometime in mid-2013.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I mentioned my questions to Brian, and you summarized eloquently and reminded us that we have accomplished a great deal, and to be sure the liquidity measures we undertook, I believe, prevented a financial meltdown and restored the economy\u2014pulled us back from the abyss.  We\u2019re now undoing all of these initiatives because the markets for interbank lending and commercial paper and money market mutual funds, asset-backed securities, and so on have been restored and have been re-liquefied.  So we\u2019ve normalized in almost all areas but one, namely, we are maintaining zero interest rates for interbank lending, promising to do so for \u201can extended period,\u201d despite the fact that the banks and the debt markets at all points on the yield curve and across the range of quality have also been restored and, in fact, are, as Governor Kohn pointed out, at least in terms of excess reserves, awash in liquidity. President Yellen had a very interesting phrase just now.  She talked about the likely direction of the journey, and I think that\u2019s the key point here.  I think it\u2019s important for us to spell out where we are likely to go.  As I mentioned in my summary of the economy, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to have inflationary pressures for the foreseeable future.  I worry enormously about absorbing this big slack we have in labor.  But I also worry about how people view us over the long term, and I\u2019m quite worried about our balance sheet. Not to put too serious a tone on this\u2014but it did catch my eye\u2014there was a very good op-ed by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Sunday New York Times when he was talking about what went wrong.  As they were celebrating perestroika, he said he didn\u2019t realize that the radicals were pushing us to move faster and the conservatives were stepping on our toes preventing our forward movement.  I think we have to be very careful here not to take too much comfort in what we\u2019ve done, because we\u2019ll be judged by where we\u2019re likely to go.  What I worry about in terms of where we\u2019re likely to go was touched on by Governor Warsh and others at the table.  We have an enormous amount of Treasury issuance coming forward.  We have an enormous amount of sovereign debt issuance coming forward.  No one mentioned this, but it was covered fairly well in the New York Times this morning, there\u2019s a huge wall of maturity in 2012 in terms of corporate debt, the debt that\u2019s going to have to be rolled over for LBOs and for junk. By postponing laying out the road map, that is, the likely direction of the journey, as President Yellen referred to it, I\u2019m just concerned that we are boxing ourselves in.  If rates were to rise because of the factors that Governor Warsh mentioned or other factors in the marketplace, I could see this Committee, if we continue down the current path, saying, \u201cWe dare not sell because we\u2019ll realize capital losses.\u201d  One hundred basis points leads to $100 billion, or whatever number you mentioned earlier. I would like us now to lay out our path.  I\u2019m in favor of alternative C\u2032, but I agree with President Kocherlakota that a melding of B and C\u2032 might be a wise thing to do, with a slight variation, and that is that I would like that fourth paragraph to be in B.  I would accept the fact that we keep the phrase \u201cfor an extended period.\u201d I think that would mitigate whatever negative influences we\u2019re worried about in terms of the market reaction.  We\u2019re saying we expect to hold rates low.  I would prefer \u201cfor some time\u201d\u2014I know I can\u2019t sell it at the table.  But if we say \u201cfor an extended period\u201d and then we marry it with that road map, the likely direction in which we are going, as stated in C\u2032 paragraph 4, I think that would be a good combination, and that\u2019s my recommendation, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you", " MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be prepared to discuss the asset sale issue next time and perhaps meld it into the statement in April after we have a full discussion, but not at this meeting.  I see a long period of inflation below target and output below target even with very low interest rates.  I don\u2019t see a need to prepare for an interest rate exit at this time.  I think that the decline in inflation and edging off of some expectation measures suggest reduced risk of inflation moving higher, and I don\u2019t see much evidence that this massive quantity of reserves is having any material effect on bank behavior.  So I don\u2019t see any reason to start the tightening process now, and I would retain \u201cextended period.\u201d  It is conditioned on the economic analysis.  I think the economic circumstances are moving about as we expected, as everyone has said, and not suggesting there is a need to tighten any time soon.  We\u2019ve had some demonstrations of the market sensitivity to hints of exit, and I think having \u201cextended period\u201d in the announcement has helped us talk about and test our exit tools without setting off persistent market speculation.  So it has been very useful in that regard. I do think it has been unfortunate to have this definition of three meetings out there for \u201cextended period,\u201d because I think it means that we don\u2019t have some of this flexibility to move.  As soon as we go to \u201cfor some time\u201d, everybody will say \u201cthat means after two meetings\u201d because the three-meeting definition is out there, even though the Committee never defined it that way.  So I don\u2019t think we have the flexibility to tinker with the language before we\u2019re sure we know we want to move pretty quickly.  I don\u2019t see, so far, low rates as having greatly adverse consequences for financial stability, though I agree we need to monitor it.  The bond spreads, equity prices, I think, are still in line with fundamentals. And given my expectation that both inflation and output and employment will remain below our objectives for a long period of time, I would have a very strong preference for using supervision and regulation to counter any hints of instability in financial markets or dangerous situations in financial markets rather than have those measures fall even further below our objectives. With regard to the bracketed sentence in paragraph B2, there\u2019s a very similar thought in the end of paragraph 3.  I like the sentence at the end of paragraph 3.  I don\u2019t see any reason to have another sentence in paragraph 2.  It singles out inflation as if we\u2019re not paying equal attention to both parts of our dual mandate.  So I would strongly object to keeping that bracketed sentence in paragraph 2.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B with some modifications and my modifications are so substantial that we may not recognize it.  [Laughter]  In paragraph 1, I actually like the \u201chowever\u201d sentence, which qualifies our description of the economy.  I also like the \u201chowever\u201d sentence from alternative A actually, which is \u201cinvestment in nonresidential structures is still contracting, housing activity continues to be sluggish, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.\u201d  I think this employer reluctance to add to payrolls is a key feature of the economic situation, maybe we should acknowledge that. In paragraph 2, I\u2019m still in favor of substituting paragraph 2 from alternative C and C\u2032\u2014they\u2019re identical.  I like that language better on this dimension.  As I\u2019ve said many times in our debates here, I feel that there\u2019s an overemphasis on the slack term in alternative B, and it puts more weight on the idea that there\u2019s a lockstep statistical relationship between slack and inflation than I think is warranted.  I also have a thought about the issue that the statement should combine monetary policy with resource utilization when we talk about inflation.  A second best would be to include the bracketed sentence in alternative B2: \u201cThe Committee expects that over time and with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will run at rates consistent with price stability.\u201d  But I prefer the language from all of paragraph 2 of alternative C and C\u2032. Concerning the \u201cextended period\u201d language, I\u2019m increasingly concerned that we are telegraphing a time-dependent policy with this wording.  I don\u2019t think we mean it that way, but it\u2019s being interpreted that way.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position to alter this today.  I think the best course of action on this would be to switch to a completely new and different and hopefully more explicitly state-contingent wording.  The markets will then have to adjust to this new wording, but it will set out and convey what the Committee has in mind.  I think it might knock the markets off the idea that a rate hike is imminent this fall, which is too early according to our staff analysis, as several people have noted.  There\u2019s hardly any scenario, according to the staff analysis, that would lead to making that kind of adjustment in the fall.  I am concerned about the mismatch between market expectations and staff analysis and to some extent Committee views.  I think better aligning these expectations might improve prospects for the economy today. Alternative B does not give forward guidance for the asset-purchase program.  My question is:  Why not.  Why give forward guidance for one aspect of our policy and not for another.  I\u2019m not going to go into too much here, but just in terms of the statement, I think passive approaches to the balance sheet runoff strike me as being far from optimal policy.  Expectations of the future of quantitative easing policy are important for economic performance.  Markets will build in expectations whether we shape them or not.  So we should go ahead and try to shape them. One way to offer some guidance for the asset-purchase program would be to include paragraph 4 from C\u2032.  C\u2032 has Treasuries rolling off the balance sheet and includes language saying that the Committee is evaluating asset sales, which I think is an accurate description of the situation.  I do not like the C version, which unnecessarily locks us into a timing protocol for our exit.  That kind of protocol is to drain reserves with term deposits and possibly reverse repos, raise the interest rate on excess reserves, and then sell assets later, maybe much later.  I prefer a timing protocol which would remove quantitative easing as appropriate as the economy improves and then raise rates later, possibly much later, and possibly in conjunction with the use of term deposits and reverse repos.  That\u2019s a last-in first-out policy.  I think that would take some pressure off the interest rate move that was dominating market reactions to this Committee. I think it\u2019s far from clear that a protocol of raising interest rates first is the optimum one.  Arguably, the reserve-draining that may accompany the interest rate move takes back much of the quantitative easing in conjunction with the increase in interest rates.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but that could be a 1937-type mistake, and I think we should analyze that very carefully.  It may make more sense to withdraw quantitative easing at an appropriate pace and then focus on short-term interest rates later. I also agree with President Fisher\u2019s concerns about the possibility of selling MBS at some later date with higher interest rates.  Suppose that we do get into the situation where we have caused a lot of inflation.  We don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll cause a lot of inflation, but now interest rates are higher and we\u2019re reluctant to sell our MBS because of capital losses.  That\u2019s a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d scenario that we have to take pretty seriously.  So I appreciate President Fisher\u2019s bringing that up.  Thank you", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A couple of comments to begin with.  I appreciate the reference to supervision, and I\u2019ve been involved in it for a number of years, and the thing that this very much reminds me of is more of a \u201cback to the future\u201d kind of environment, because I have been through the energy price crisis and the agricultural land crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management crisis, and there are many similarities.  And to that point, I know that we can\u2019t necessarily identify bubbles.  That\u2019s not my point.  My point is that we do tend to create conditions that invite bubbles, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned about as we look forward.  I do realize\u2014very, very much\u2014that the fundamental challenge for this Committee is to balance the near-term economic conditions with the longer-term risk of inflation, but, to my mind, also financial imbalances and financial stability.  That\u2019s a part of the challenge we have. Certainly, current conditions warrant a low interest rate environment\u2014I\u2019m not arguing that point.  But I am equally concerned that the longer-run risk to financial and economic stability warrant eliminating our commitment to exceptionally low rates for an extended period.  My concern is that we need to give more weight to these longer-run risks now, before we actually see them and ask \u201cIs this a bubble.\u201d because by the time you ask that question, you\u2019re probably too late.  My concern is that, in not looking at the long run, we may keep rates lower than we should longer than we should, thereby creating the conditions that foster the future imbalances that I worry about.  The Committee needs the flexibility in the coming months to move from the emergency level of accommodation implemented during the financial crisis a year ago to a level of accommodation that appropriately balances\u2014and remember I said \u201clevel of accommodation\u201d\u2014the short-run and the longer-run macroeconomic and financial risks that we face. What are some of the longer-run risks that I think about and worry about and I know all of you do as well.  While the research is early and not typically included in most models, some past crises I, at least, have observed have stemmed in part from exceptionally low interest rate guarantees, which have contributed to the buildup of financial imbalances\u2014I think we\u2019ve seen some of that over the past decade\u2014encouraging leverage and facilitating credit booms.  Over the past decade extensive resources under those conditions have been channeled to residential and nonresidential construction and to financial markets.  While they have benefited the financial institutions, they also have penalized savers.  I know the reasons for maintaining low interest rates are important\u2014we\u2019re trying to maintain the broader economy\u2014but there are consequences.  And finally exceptionally low interest rates and the Federal Reserve\u2019s large balance sheet, if maintained too long, should lead to an unanchoring of long-run inflation expectations.  That\u2019s the last of the issues that I have been trying to bring up and have brought up in the past. So in light of these risks, there is, I think, a case for modestly raising the interest rate on reserves and the federal funds rate target sooner than the Greenbook or the markets necessarily assume.  I\u2019m not talking about now, but I\u2019m thinking sooner than the Greenbook and the markets.  Any such move, if it is to be effective, will be some surprise to the market, of course, but less so if we remove our current guarantee of exceptionally low rates.  And if we remove it, we stop this issue of \u201cWhat does it mean. Six months.  Or three months.\u201d and so on, which only creates its own set of uncertainties.  I think we ought to have some flexibility in case we need to begin to raise rates late this summer, to start bringing them back to 1 percent\u2014which I think of as a reversal of the emergency actions, not really a tightening of monetary policy.  That flexibility should be ours, and we can\u2019t have that until we get rid of this language. Turning to the exit strategy, I know we\u2019re going to have the discussion at the next meeting, but I generally support C\u2032, and if I had my druthers, I would say we\u2019re going to start redeeming government securities in April and not wait until after our next meeting. I\u2019ll stop with that, except to say that for me C\u2032 is where we ought to be heading.  The reason to begin tightening policy soon is not simply or even primarily to prevent the issues around inflationary pressures immediately.  That\u2019s longer term and important.  Rather it is to prevent future buildup of financial imbalances and reduce the risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability that come from maintaining a commitment to exceptionally low rates for an extended period of time.  Thank you", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My view hasn\u2019t changed since the last meeting.  Substantial monetary policy accommodation is still appropriate.  Alternative B captures this need as well as other factors that justify this policy stance. I don\u2019t favor including a sentence in paragraph 2 on inflation.  It seems a little odd to me.  I don\u2019t think it would be well understood.  \u201cThe Committee expects that over time and with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will run at rates consistent with price stability.\u201d  This is usually a phrase that we use when inflation expectations are too high.  If we use this sentence today, it requires that everybody understand that we\u2019re below our inflation target, so the appropriate policy would be to goose things a little bit.  I just think it would cause confusion. The sequencing in alternative C and C\u2032 is intriguing, and I certainly accept putting this off until April for a full robust discussion.  But I have to admit, with the enormous accommodation that we have in place, appropriately, I think it\u2019s essential to have in mind the dynamic plan for where monetary policy is going.  I just can\u2019t really accept alternative B repeatedly without having in mind some idea of what future monetary policy actions are going to be, in this context.  I think it\u2019s critical to think about future policy tightening in the context of a baseline outlook, in terms of the models that we\u2019re presented with\u2014our best efforts, such as FRB/US, the Greenbook analyses, and FOMC central tendency projections.  I favor thinking about them seriously.  And that\u2019s what we have for looking into the policy future. Assuming that these forecasts basically hold\u2014they\u2019re in the ballpark\u2014this is what we\u2019re expecting:  We\u2019re expecting unemployment to move only slowly\u2014the unemployment rate might break through 8 percent sometime in 2011, if the Bluebook\u2019s chart 7 is correct; in terms of economic growth, we\u2019re not sure about what the sources of growth are going to be, but I think it\u2019ll be stronger than labor markets alone suggest, though we\u2019ll still have a sizable resource gap; core inflation is expected to be about 1\u00bd percent at the end of 2011\u2014maybe medium-term inflation expectations would have a slightly higher range for 2012\u2014but that\u2019s the situation that we\u2019ll be in. I won\u2019t venture into the April sequencing discussion now, but chart 7 in the Bluebook implies that the funds rate will be zero at the end of 2012.  Although I don\u2019t trust this model analysis completely, other things could happen.  This is sobering to me.  And I guess my question would be:  Which analyses suggest something different than this.  We all have fears of risks.  At the moment I can\u2019t see them that clearly.  So I can imagine, much as President Rosengren indicated, that alternative B will be appropriate for an extended period.  And I\u2019m a little concerned that once we signal that the alternative C preparations are appropriate, there\u2019s going to be a lot of momentum.  I think President Lacker was capturing that when he said something like, \u201cEven as we have this sequencing, the \u2018extended period\u2019 language might still be appropriate.\u201d  I think containing that momentum is going to be tough.  Once we start, the train keeps running and the next thing we know we\u2019ll be talking about tightening.  If we could separate it as well as President Lacker and President Bullard were suggesting, then I\u2019d find that pretty acceptable.  But I am kind of concerned about that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  MR. LACKER.  Yes"], "2010FOMC20100428meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What\u2019s striking to me about the analysis\u2014which I also think deserves the glowing praise you heaped on it earlier this afternoon, it was very, very helpful\u2014is how small the effects are on the macroeconomy and on interest rates.  As I  recall, in the most aggressive strategy you described, the effect is 35 to 50 basis points on longer-term yields. The memo also mentions a 15 basis point additional effect on the MBS\u2013Treasury spread, which has increased by about that much in the last couple of months anyway.  To me, this makes a very aggressive and fairly rapidly commenced strategy pretty attractive.  So I\u2019m attracted to option 5.  In fact, I like to refer to it as the \u201ccentennial strategy,\u201d because it is the only one that gets us out of MBS before the Federal Reserve System centennial.  [Laughter]  I think that has some independent benefit. One drawback someone might articulate regarding an aggressive program is that it withdraws monetary policy stimulus too rapidly.  That\u2019s what the letter that I distributed last Friday was really aimed at addressing.  It\u2019s just to point out that our security holdings fall in two categories\u2014it gives us two variables\u2014which means we can make the sum do something different from the total of our MBS holdings.  As I read the staff\u2019s analysis, their belief is that the sum of our security holdings is what is responsible for the effect on long-term yields, and I am seeing Mr. Reifschneider nodding his head in assent.  So it suggests that what we could do is commit to a brisk pace, pretty soon, of getting the composition of our portfolio back to Treasuries-only pretty rapidly, and then think separately about monetary policy, that is, think separately about stimulus.   We could use our decision about redemptions and our decision about our overall holdings of Treasuries to calibrate how much monetary stimulus we\u2019re withdrawing and at what pace.  We can then craft our language accordingly, so that the unwinding of our special intervention in the MBS market is viewed much like our getting out of these special programs.  This would have the advantage of addressing the tension that was evident the last time we spoke of this between the desire to comfort the MBS market about the expected pace of our sales\u2014to provide some surety, some confidence in how we\u2019re going to proceed\u2014and the desire to retain the contingent nature of monetary policy; we could commit to making monetary policy contingent on incoming data on economic and financial conditions.  This would do that by taking those two apart, saying to the MBS market, which is not as deep as the Treasury market, \u201cWe can give you some surety,\u201d while at the same time saying to the deep and liquid Treasury market, \u201cThis is where our intervention, the size of our holdings, is going to be contingent on incoming information.\u201d  The broader point I was trying to make is that it doesn\u2019t make sense to oppose rapid MBS sales on the basis that it would withdraw monetary policy stimulus too rapidly.  That\u2019s what I wanted to disentangle. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I do think asset sales should commence fairly soon.  A June announcement wouldn\u2019t be too soon in my book, and a summertime commencement wouldn\u2019t be too soon in my book.  If it were up to me, I don\u2019t think I would add in Treasury purchases.  I don\u2019t think we need to do that, but I just offer that up as an option for those who might otherwise be attracted to an aggressive pace of sales but fear too rapid a monetary policy stimulus reduction. I don\u2019t think we should decide on redemptions until we\u2019ve figured out asset sales.  I don\u2019t think it makes sense for us to sign up for redeeming Treasuries and then go down the road to the next meeting and look at a situation where we would say, \u201cOh, to sell MBS would be withdrawing too much stimulus.\u201d  I think it makes sense to consider these in the context of one decision, one crafted strategy about our portfolio going forward.  Those are my remarks, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you", " MR. BULLARD.  I\u2019m a little ambivalent on Treasury redemptions.  I\u2019m going to talk tomorrow in favor of it, but I\u2019m not strongly in favor", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will join the chorus of praise for the staff.  This is a fascinating set of memos.  I learned a lot, and it has stimulated a lot of thinking about different things. My view is a kind of linear combination of perhaps 2, but probably 3 and 5.  One of the things that struck me about this memo, which has already been said, was the rather modest effects of very rapid sales on the economy\u2014not zero, but moderate\u2014which leads me to have more confidence that we can exit from this unusually large balance sheet perhaps more rapidly than we might have thought.  I say that because, again, my objective, like that of many others, is  to reduce the size of the balance sheet and get its composition back to all-Treasuries.  The question then arises of what the pace should be and how we would go about doing that.  I think one of the debates about this relates particularly to the relationship between when we raise rates and when we start selling assets, whenever that may be.  I guess I would stress that we don\u2019t really know very much about how policy and the economy will respond as we raise the IOER rate when we have a balance sheet with a trillion dollars of excess reserves. Our confidence in how monetary policy is going to work in that environment is highly uncertain.  So I think it behooves us to take seriously the option of trying to get the balance sheet somewhat more in control before we begin to rely only on moving the funds rate target.  That could protect us from finding ourselves in a position somewhere down the road where we may decide that we have to raise rates very rapidly, and shrink the balance sheet very rapidly, and deal with all of the concomitant complications that that may pose for us.  I think a more prudent policy would be to begin earlier, so that we have more confidence in our ability to execute both a funds rate policy and a shrinking of the balance sheet policy. I guess my views are partly a linear combination of President Kocherlakota\u2019s, President Bullard\u2019s, and President Lacker\u2019s.  I am sympathetic to the notion that it\u2019s a good idea to have some conditionality in our ability to shrink the balance sheet.  In particular, committing for five years that this is the pace of our sales and then sticking with it seems to me to be perhaps unwise, particularly when we don\u2019t know the consequences of our funds rate policy in hitting our monetary policy targets.  I also think that if we have to raise interest rates very high, with high excess reserves, we end up paying lots of money to the banking system in the short run, and I\u2019m not sure politically that\u2019s going to look very good, either.  I think there are good arguments for not sequencing these things.  I think you may have to take them jointly as we move forward.  I like the idea of committing to sell assets perhaps for an intermeeting period, or maybe three months or so, and then having the option to reevaluate the pace at which we sell those assets.  But I would prefer, as in option 5, to make that pace more aggressive early.  And if we need to slow it down, we could choose to do that. I would also add that, in talk about the tightening of policy, I think we have to understand that, as the economy continues to grow\u2014whether or not we have met our dual mandate, which I think it\u2019s important to achieve\u2014if we leave the funds rate where it is, we will actually be creating more accommodative policy relative to where we were.  So I think we have to be a little careful in how we interpret our behavior here. Mr. Chairman, the last question was about both communications and redemptions.  On communication, I think it is very important that at this meeting, either in the minutes or maybe preferably in the statement, we make it clear that asset sales are in fact on the table, that they are a tool of policy, that we desire to shrink the balance sheet over time and to return to an all- Treasuries portfolio, and that at subsequent meetings this Committee will be further considering the timing and pace of such sales.  I think it\u2019s very important that we make that as clear as we possibly can. On Treasury redemptions, I\u2019m somewhat ambivalent here.  I would like to see Treasury redemptions simply because it furthers my goal of shrinking the balance sheet.  But I also have some sympathy for the view that if we didn\u2019t want to shrink the balance sheet quite as fast, then I would prefer, as President Lacker suggested, that we roll non-Treasury redemptions over into short-term Treasury bills, which would give us more flexibility going forward.  I would be amenable to such a strategy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start briefly with my premises.  First, I don\u2019t want to tighten monetary policy right now.  Second, I agree with President  Rosengren\u2019s point that the size and composition of the balance sheet is not an end in itself, but a means to achieving the ends specified by the Congress in our dual mandate.  Third, in general I prefer maintaining our ability to adjust policy to the conditions as we find them.  But, fourth, I think there is some guidance needed in markets, specifically with respect to the question of asset sales.  That\u2019s the thing that I find that people have asked about the most, substantially more than interest on excess balances or term deposits or anything else. Which considerations have most affected me of these that I\u2019ve heard from you today and from staff and others in the days leading up to this meeting.  One is that it\u2019s a bit hard for me to see how anything but really quite substantial asset sales before a change in our target could actually do very much to sop up some of that soggy bottom that we may be looking at when we want to increase the target rate.  There is uncertainty, obviously, about what reactions will be, what the perceived signaling effect of our beginning to sell assets will be.  So even though I think people have done a good job of trying to project what those reactions will be, we don\u2019t have any history on the basis of which to extrapolate. Next, as several people have pointed out, we would be in a very uncomfortable position if we wanted to reverse sales, if we thought, \u201cOops, we made some sales, turns out that that was a little bit premature, and now we want to go back.\u201d  I think that the hurdle for that kind of reversal would be considered quite high by everybody around the table. Next, though, is sort of the converse of that.  Once we are in a mode in which we want to tighten, I think that we should contemplate the possibility that we might sell assets fairly quickly or sell a lot of assets fairly quickly, depending on the circumstances as we find them.  That is to say, if we are in a mode in which we have decided that tightening is warranted, we\u2019ll presumably have made the judgment that markets can sustain the tightening without pushing the economy in  an unfavorable direction, and where, obviously, by definition, we\u2019re not worried about either signaling or actually tightening.  So, if a situation such as President Plosser contemplates were to be realized, I think that we, in turn, should contemplate moving in parallel with both policy tools as quickly as might be needed. Where does this all leave me.  Well, it leaves me wanting a fairly parsimonious decision, because obviously some of my premises are actually or potentially in conflict with one another.  And that leads me to\u2014[laughter]\u2014that\u2019s the nature of policymaking, President Yellen, in addition to saying \u201cso moved.\u201d  I\u2019m not uncomfortable with needing to balance those considerations, but they lead me to a parsimonious option 2, because what I hope that we can do coming out of this meeting is to signal with some clarity that asset sales will not begin until we have specified an increase in the target rate, and, in line with what Kevin was saying earlier, to indicate that we\u2019re prepared to move forward with a plan at that point, which would be reasonably predictable and from which we could deviate if unusual circumstances dictated that we do so.  But I don\u2019t think, at this moment, that we either need to or should decide, for example, whether some variant on option 3 or option 4 is the right way to go, once we do make the decision to begin selling those assets. On redemption of Treasuries, I guess at this juncture I\u2019m opposed for the reason that President Lacker stated.  I think it\u2019s best to bind these decisions up together when the time comes to make them.  And, as I\u2019ve already intimated, my preferred mode of communication would not be in the statement, certainly not this statement, because, again, I think that leads us towards tightening.  Obviously, the minutes will speak for themselves.  But I would hope that we would collectively equip the Chairman to be able to speak with the confidence that the whole FOMC is  behind him on the elements of this consensus that we are able to reach, understanding that there will be some elements of our decision that will need to await a future meeting.  Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, another possible measurement issue is tax refunds, which are not counted as current income but are probably higher this quarter than they have been on average.  That also could explain part of the change", " MR. STOCKTON.  But even that effect on consumption would in some sense be a little bit more like a wealth effect, because presumably those people are going to have to pay for housing sooner or later.  So it isn\u2019t an increase in their permanent income by that amount.  It\u2019s a certain period of time in which they might be able to consume housing services free, but ultimately they\u2019re going to have to pay for it.  So that was a small, incremental effect on wealth.  It could have a small positive effect.  We didn\u2019t really think that was likely to be material", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  There\u2019s a timing issue here on these wealth effects, as well, in the sense that banks are taking write-downs on these loans in anticipation of losses.  Looking ahead, the market is pricing that into valuations of firms, so that\u2019s getting into net worth.  But if you think about it from the point of view of households that are in trouble, the bank may be assuming that they\u2019re going to be writing down the debt, but the household doesn\u2019t know it yet.  So there\u2019s uncertainty about the timing but eventually those two things come in sync.  But that goes on in downturns regularly.  It\u2019s more pronounced in this one, but it\u2019s not clear that this effect isn\u2019t picked up by the fact that it\u2019s correlated with other things reflecting the depth of the recession.  There are other variables in our models, like the unemployment rate and so on, which may be more or less proxying for these effects", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  They\u2019ve been very clear that they\u2019re concerned that a restructuring would just create contagion and lead to a run on other countries.  At the same time, they have another serious issue:  There\u2019s a very severe doubt that this coalition could come together to do the same thing for Portugal or another country. Vice Chairman, you had an interjection", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, I just wanted to expand a little bit.  The German situation is particularly problematic because they have these state elections.  This whole idea of  aid to Greece is very unpopular, yet the German government clearly wants to come forward with the aid, and they haven\u2019t explained yet to the German voters that this isn\u2019t a one-year package anymore, this is a three-year package, and it\u2019s going to have to be a lot bigger to be viable.  I think what the Germans are hoping is that the IMF and Greece will work out a three-year agreement that\u2019s very tough on Greece and then they\u2019ll say to the voters, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got this really tough agreement.  Oh, by the way, now the aid package is for three years.  It\u2019s going to be much bigger than we thought.\u201d  And they hope that they can get it through that way.  That\u2019s why you\u2019re hearing all of this tough talk out of Germany, because they\u2019re trying to prepare the ground for ramming this through at the end.  What\u2019s going on in Germany is pretty complicated, and there\u2019s a lot of politics and a lot of theater involved, so we\u2019ll see if it plays out smoothly or not over the next week or two", "  I hope that someone is assuming that this aid doesn\u2019t come through and they do go into default because\u2014 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We\u2019re looking at it.  European banks are another transmission channel.  One could imagine that if we started seeing contagion to Portugal, Spain, maybe even Italy, people will start to become worried about the European banks.  Then you could actually have a dollar funding problem again as U.S. banks start to back away from European banks.  We don\u2019t have the swap agreements in place.  We don\u2019t have any sort of mechanism to provide dollar liquidity to Europe.  So the LIBOR problem that we saw a year and a half ago could potentially resurface.  So there\u2019s some real risk here", "  MR. SHEETS.  In terms of the transmission, my sense is that Portugal is very vulnerable.  They have big fiscal deficits, relatively large debt-to-GDP ratios, and I think there\u2019s a perception that they have not yet taken the situation sufficiently seriously and put into place a rigorous adjustment program to address the fiscal problems that they face.  I see Portugal as being quite vulnerable.  In contrast, I think it would take a very strong wind for this thing to spill over into Spain.  Spain is much larger.  It doesn\u2019t have the imbalances.  It has been influenced by the global financial crisis and is experiencing a severe recession, but underneath it, I think that there\u2019s pretty much universal respect for the Spanish policymakers. With that said, if things did move from Portugal and Greece into Spain, then at that point it would get brutal, and let me give you one parameterization of that.  Western European bank exposure, including the CDS, to Greece is about $240 billion.  To Portugal it\u2019s about $290 billion.  To Spain it\u2019s almost a trillion dollars.  So if it hits Spain, I think what we have is not just a Southern European crisis, but we also have a more generalized sovereign risk crisis.  At that point, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s some probability that it could move across the channel to the United Kingdom and perhaps become a broader problem.  I see in this a firewall between the Portuguese and the Spaniards.  If the crisis blows over that firewall, then it could get much more severe", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.   They have a book of business, and that book includes funding their dollar assets.  If their credit quality were to come into question, their counterparties would back away.  If U.S. banks back away, even though the crisis isn\u2019t with respect to dollar assets, you could still have a dollar funding shortfall because of counterparty risk", "  April 28\u2014Morning Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  We had a number of phone calls from Europe this morning.  Markets are fairly stressed.  For example, some of the banks are having difficulty getting dollars at this point, so there is a great deal of concern.  The markets have apparently fully priced in default by Greece, so there\u2019s a lot of discussion going on about how to address that concern, and, in particular, whether other countries that are similarly situated should take preemptive steps to forestall concerns about their fiscal situation.  We\u2019ll have additional calls later today and tomorrow. The Vice Chairman was on a call this morning.  We\u2019ll let you go first in the go-round, and you can report additionally on that. I understand Nathan has distributed a chart to answer a question that was raised yesterday about the residual maturity of outstanding debt.4  Does anyone have any questions about that", " MR. WARSH: Sixty months, I think", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You were a bit ambiguous.  Did you say you favored redemptions or not", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B with the language in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 5 precisely as they are.  I continue to be sympathetic to President Bullard\u2019s desire both to do policy in a more state-contingent fashion and to say so, but I agree with President Evans that the interpretation of any such move in that direction now is likely to be wrongly interpreted by the markets. I\u2019m against inclusion of anything from alternatives A, B, or C in paragraph 4.  For reasons some of you have said, I think we\u2019re not at a point where it is useful to communicate such consensus as there is in the Delphic tones that the FOMC statements take.  So, for the present, a rich description in the minutes plus, again, I hope, the opportunity for the Chairman to  speak to these issues with the assurance of being backed up by the Committee is probably the best way to go until June.  Thank you", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I favor doing as little as possible"], "2010FOMC20100509confcall.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Will we sterilize these ourselves", " MR. SHEETS.  Brian actually has these data", " MR. LACKER.  But if we don\u2019t sterilize, we\u2019re adding to bank reserves, we\u2019re essentially taking the funding from banks and lending it on through the ECB.  If we do sterilize with reserve draining, then what are we doing.  We\u2019re taking it from money market mutual funds and handing it on", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019d like to go back to Jeff\u2019s point about sterilization for a minute.  I\u2019m wondering about the optics.  If the ECB announces that its interventions in these markets are going to be sterilized, and we, on the other hand, say we\u2019re not going to sterilize, in effect we\u2019re doing quantitative easing in the United States, whereas they are, in fact, resisting by sterilizing their own intervention in the other markets.  So I\u2019m a little bit curious about the imbalance in how we\u2019re going to treat that.  It sort of goes back to Jeff\u2019soriginal question.  I think it\u2019s a difficult question.  Do we want to be easing here on behalf of the Europeans in that case", " MR. HOENIG.  Would there be pushback on this in the political context, where someone might say, \u201cWell, shouldn\u2019t you collateralize this with their reserves.\u201d  Is that going to come up.  And if it is, how do we answer that", "MR. KOHN.  It would look like a vote of no confidence", "  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I\u2019ll go to Nathan in just a second, but let me comment that, in all of these calls, the Germans keep saying what a great example they\u2019re going to set by consolidating their own fiscal position.  And we keep trying to point out to them that it may not necessarily be in the overall interest of the continent\u2014it\u2019s a strange mind-set. Nathan, or anyone, do you have a view on the outlook for Europe", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I support doing this.  Obviously, it would be better if we could get greater concessions and fiscal consolidation in Europe.  But the reality is that the swaps will mitigate the bad feedback loop that\u2019s occurring because of the intersection of the sovereign risk problems with the state of the European banks.  If we weren\u2019t to do this now, I think things would just get worse, and we would be forced into doing it later.  The reality is that doing it earlier will actually mitigate the extent of the problems to some degree.  But we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves.  The swaps are addressing a symptom of the problem.  The underlying problem is the European fiscal situation, the credibility of their fiscal plans, and the health of the European banks.  This just will mitigate how that spreads.  Still, I think it\u2019s worth doing, because, as we\u2019ve seen, the propagation mechanisms and these amplifying dynamics that we\u2019ve seen in the earlier parts of the crisis can be pretty important.  So I think anything we can do to get out in front of that is a good thing rather than a bad thing", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, am supportive of giving you approval to proceed with the swap lines, contingent upon Ecofin coming up with strong measures, as well as some follow-up that you\u2019re going to do to control some of the political fallout.  Like others, I believe it\u2019s critical that we take these actions based on the economic merits, so I\u2019m supportive of your moving forward.  Thank you", "MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the past, I\u2019ve generally opposed swaps as a matter of regime choice.  I still oppose them, but this is not the time to take a gigantic bold leap towards a regime I\u2019d like.  So I won\u2019t oppose this now, and I\u2019ll support giving you the discretion to enter into these, as you said.  I think the political risks are tremendous.  I think there\u2019s a good chance we will dodge them with expert communication, and I think the comments of President Fisher and others about needing to manage those aggressively are worthwhile.  I think the confluence of those risks with this environment and what we\u2019re doing here isn\u2019t an accident.  This is one of a set of essentially fiscal policy actions we\u2019ve taken in the last three years that have generated this firestorm around us.  The continuing fallout of that generates the environment that makes this fiscal policy action more politically risky for us. On sterilization, I\u2019d love to use this as an opportunity to argue for selling an equivalent amount of MBS, but we can wait until another date for that.  Those are my comments.  I support your decision", " MR. BULLARD.  On the Bank of Canada, it just occurred to me that we, of course, have a swap line with Canada already, and we also have one with Mexico, and I wonder if there would be any considerations about that situation"], "2010FOMC20100623meeting.txt": ["VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  I just want to suggest that the cost should be one of the parameters, because there is an effect on the taxpayer in terms of how we do this, namely, what the net amount of money that we rebate to the Treasury is.  So I think that should be one of the criteria, though certainly not to the exclusion of all the other criteria", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, your conditional clause there was very important, that we would have to do this in a way that didn\u2019t signal broader monetary tightening, and our ability to do that is at least debatable", " MR. LACKER.  In our purchase agreement, if our counterparty is failing to us, what obligation do we have.  Can we cancel it.  Can we unwind it.  Can we renege", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It\u2019s important to understand that fails can occur for two reasons.  One is a shortage of security.  The other is because the interest rate is so low and there\u2019s no penalty for not delivering.  In the Treasury market, of course, there are penalties for not delivering, and there are essentially no fails in that market.  There is under way, I understand\u2014   Brian, you can correct me\u2014a process now to have an analogous penalty in the MBS market.  Presumably, at least for the 4.5s, that must be the principal source of the fails", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I understand Tom Hoenig\u2019s position, which is very straightforward and consistent with what Tom has said before, namely, that he\u2019d like to begin to reduce the size of the balance sheet.  That\u2019s why, when presented with Brian\u2019s issue, he responds accordingly.  But I\u2019m, maybe not bemused, but a bit interested in, Charlie and Jeff, how you are parsing this.  On the one hand, you say, \u201cCouldn\u2019t we explain it in a purely technical fashion.\u201d  On the other hand\u2014this may be the equivalent of taking judicial notice\u2014I\u2019m aware of your views on asset sales as well.  So I\u2019m wondering:  Aren\u2019t you, in all honesty, sort of motivated by some of the same things that are motivating Tom.  And if that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t this saying, \u201cWell, couldn\u2019t we convince people that it\u2019s really technical.\u201d even though it may not be the sole motivation that we would have for doing it", "MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the last meeting, a majority of us thought that sales should occur after tightening.  I don\u2019t think we should be revisiting this at each meeting.  I think we should come to a conclusion and stand by it.  I think the reason that a majority of us thought that sales should go after a tightening is because sales are a tightening.  They may be of a small magnitude, but the direction is clear\u2014it\u2019s a tightening. The reason mortgage rates have fallen is not because the economy is so strong, it\u2019s because the economy is weaker than it was before.  What was striking in Brian\u2019s first memo was a 20 percent chance that somebody falls off the euro.  Well, I think the reason mortgage rates are so low is that the possibility of a tail event has gone up substantially, and that wasn\u2019t the case at the previous meeting.  So I think it would be particularly puzzling right now\u2014in this environment, with the inflation rate forecast lower, the unemployment rate forecast higher, the market as a whole thinking that interest rates are lower because a bad outcome is more likely, and the stock market down\u2014if we said we\u2019ve decided to do a tightening.  I find it quite inconsistent that we would do a tightening at this meeting, even if it is of a small magnitude.  So I don\u2019t think that we should take back what we had agreed to and what we represented in the minutes at the last meeting. On the Treasuries, my preference spills over a little into our forecast discussion in the next two parts of the meeting, but I don\u2019t think this is the time to make any changes at all.  My preference would be to make no change in what we\u2019re doing for the Treasury portfolio.  Over time, I can see some logic in shortening the maturity, but I don\u2019t think this is the time to do it.  If anything, the probability of having to do more purchases has gone up rather than down.  We\u2019re closer to a deflationary scenario, and we\u2019re closer to an environment in which we could have a really bad outcome, and we don\u2019t have many tools to deal with a really bad outcome.  Interestrates are already bound by zero, so our only option is sales or purchases of other assets.  In that environment, this is a particularly good time not to do anything and see if we might actually have to do more purchases rather than more sales as time goes on.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  The more I think about this, the harder it is for me to shake this idea that the size and the composition of our asset holdings are two distinct things that we can vary differently.  I\u2019m struck by the extent to which, at the last meeting, some earlier meetings, and the discussion now, asset sales are viewed as synonymous with reducing the size of our asset holdings.  I read over the minutes of the last meeting.  Everyone who spoke against asset sales was speaking against reducing the size of our asset holdings.  No one opposing asset sales said anything about the composition of our balance sheet.  The minutes accurately reflect that a majority were in that camp.  I think it\u2019s misleading\u2014and I wish I had brought this up when we had a chance to edit the minutes\u2014to refer to that as asset sales.  In fact, a majority favored not taking steps to reduce our asset holdings. We all want to normalize our balance sheet and return to Treasuries-only\u2014it\u2019s one of our principles.  It looks to me as if we can have both.  We have these four principles here.  There\u2019s a Pareto improvement available to us, where we can normalize our balance sheet more rapidly without sacrificing anything on the other dimensions.  So I\u2019d advocate selling.  We\u2019re talking about taking the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and buying assets with them.  Not only is this the status quo, but we\u2019re buying new assets as we go along.  I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t embark on a program of selling mortgage-backed securities.  And if the majority of the Committee believes we shouldn\u2019t reduce the size of our asset holdings until after the first interest rate increase, well, then, so be it\u2014we\u2019ll put the proceeds into short-term Treasuries.  As for the narrow question, Ifavor option 2, because I don\u2019t want to reduce our Treasury holdings\u2014we\u2019re only going to increase them later as we roll off MBS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Can I respectfully pose a question to Governor Kohn", " MR. KOHN.  Obviously, less concerned.  I think if we had a good reason for doing that, and if it were well advertised ahead of time, and if I could be pretty sure it wouldn\u2019t upend the mortgage market, obviously I\u2019d be a little bit less concerned.I\u2019m a little surprised, to tell the truth, about this discussion about buying Treasuries.  For example, when we talked about buying Treasuries, President Fisher, you were really concerned about its implications for perceptions of our independence.  I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re less concerned now", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On the Treasury redemption and reinvestment policy, I just wanted to say I found the memo on this topic from Brian Madigan and Brian Sack very helpful.  So thanks a lot to you and to everyone who worked on that. I prefer the status quo policy for today, which is to continue to reinvest according to long-standing practice without any additional attempt to shorten the maturity structure.  Mainly I agree with many others here that we probably should not try to send a signal on monetary policy today.  We could move to that policy later.  I don\u2019t think it would have a big effect at the time that we decide to do that. On the full redemption policy, while I have some sympathy for that, I think that would move the Committee away from the desired ultimate asset composition, which is Treasuries-only.  I think that would send a confusing signal and might be confusing to us as well about what we\u2019re trying to do here.  We can achieve much more by simply selling agency MBS at the appropriate pace and at the appropriate time so as to reassure markets that the FOMC remainscommitted to achieving low and stable inflation outcomes.  I think there\u2019s some good news, namely, that the MBS are actually in demand\u2014that\u2019s encouraging.  I\u2019m also fine with the swaps for the 5.5 fails.  The main concern I\u2019d have there is whether we\u2019re doing anything unusual or anything that would look like a favor to those that have failed to deliver.  As I understand it, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re doing that\u2014we\u2019re using normal market procedures here.  But I would be concerned about anything that would smack of somehow letting people out of a contract or something.  But I don\u2019t get the sense that that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here. On asset sales, I still advocate the LIFO policy\u2014last in, first out\u2014which would put asset sales before the first increase in short-term interest rates.  I think it makes sense to take back the quantitative easing at the appropriate time\u2014not today, but at the appropriate time\u2014without tying it to short-term interest rate increases. I actually am quite concerned about the policy that seems to be gelling around the table here\u2014raising short-term interest rates and simultaneously signaling the end of the quantitative easing policy\u2014because that is an \u201ceverything at once\u201d policy, and we\u2019re not taking advantage of the fact that we have two instruments.  One could interpret the policy of raising rates, or even hinting that we\u2019re going to raise rates by changing the language, as simultaneously signaling two things:  that we\u2019re going to raise rates and that, within some short period of time, we\u2019ll start to end the quantitative easing policy.  That might be more tightening than is desired at that moment. I think the better way to play this is to say that we would take back the quantitative easing, which is the last thing we did, without necessarily signaling anything about what we\u2019re going to do with interest rates; we even could extend the \u201cextended period\u201d language and say we might wait on interest rate policy, and we\u2019ll get the balance sheet back to a more normal size and a more normal composition in a reasonable amount of time.I am very concerned about this \u201ceverything at once\u201d policy, and I think I\u2019ll remain an advocate for the LIFO policy for now.  Thank you", " MR. FISHER.  I have a couple of questions on the international section.  One inflationary impulse that I hear countering a tremendous amount of deflationary impulses relates to transportation.  The HARPEX Index and the Hamburg Index, which measure container transportation, have come up dramatically since mid-June, and you hear retailers complain about that.  Second, of course, is the expectation that Chinese prices are pretty stiff, given wage settlements and given what they\u2019re asking for during the post-Christmas buying season in terms of clothing, shoes, and other things.  In your presentation for global economic growth, we have reduced our expectations, including for China, and I\u2019m wondering how you account for these transportation pressures.  Is it slow steaming, or is it something else, a dynamic that\u2019s in place. My second question is:  Are we likely to see the Chinese back off from some of these price demands.  The reason I ask is that I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s much likelihood that it will work its way through to consumption here, but it does impact retailers\u2019 margins.  I\u2019m curious as to what your views on those two issues are", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At my directors meeting last week, several directors made an analogy to a turtle that had bravely stuck its head out in the first quarter, but quickly retreated to its shell in May.  [Laughter]  Most of the data we\u2019ve seen reflects the period when the turtle was out of its shell, but, in the coming weeks, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll get confirmation detailing why the turtle\u2019s courage was short-lived.  Many of my contacts highlighted that the headlines from Europe have caused them to reevaluate hiring and investment decisions, presumably linked in large part to the expectation of declining export demand as the dollar strengthens and many countries undertake fiscal tightening. My forecasts have been predicated on a fragile job market, partly offset by moderate growth in business fixed investment.  If my business contacts\u2019 pullback in these key areas in the face of European problems is representative, then the risk of slower growth than I had previously forecast has increased.  And my concern over the outlook extends beyond the effects of European troubles, with state and local spending clearly in retreat, and with the housing sector likely faltering.  In sum, I am worried that the Tealbook may be too optimistic. In terms of financial markets, I am concerned about the effects of a gradual but cumulatively significant withdrawal from European exposures.  U.S. money market funds have been an important source of funding for European banks. My contacts with money market funds indicate that they are becoming increasingly concerned about exposure in Europe.  In particular, the money market funds are concerned that investors in their funds will flee if they see large exposures to Europe and cannot differentiate between sound and weak European names.  Ingeneral, there\u2019s a lack of confidence in the political will to make adequate adjustments in Europe.  If my contacts are right, the problems emanating from Europe will gradually worsen.  I share many of their concerns, and I am more concerned about Europe being able to muddle through than is reflected in many of our briefing documents. Even if Europe is able to avoid a severe contraction and more significant financial problems, my outlook in the near term for the U.S. economy entails a heightened risk of deflation.  Spain and Ireland are experiencing deflation even before the full effect of fiscal austerity has been felt.  Japan remains in deflation and has shown little ability to pull out.  I am worried that we may be underestimating the risk of deflation and that we are placing too much weight on well-anchored expectations at a time when we are seeing disinflation in wages and declines in a surprising number of components of the CPI.  While I\u2019m confident that we have the tools to offset inflation, the Japanese experience makes me less confident about the tools available to offset deflation.  Should the European problems cause an economic stall, the deflation risks would become even greater. Given the move towards fiscal austerity in the United States that is likely to be even more pronounced after the election, and given that alternative monetary policies have shown to be of only limited help, both here and abroad, it is not clear how forceful our response would or could be if the economy slows and we experience deflation.  This is a risk we should be seeking to minimize and is something we should take seriously as we think about adverse economic scenarios", "  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  Yes, I know.  You gave him the ball if you wanted to run right up the middle and gain short yardage, which he was consistently good at doing, and for that he was named three times, at three different positions, as an All-Pro.  No one has broken that record. Why do I mention that.  Because what brought us out of the end zone was inventory correction.  That player\u2019s legs are tired, and I think that has basically run its course.  I\u2019m hearing that from almost every sector that I talked to.  The second yardage was gained by equipment and software, and again, even though that continues if you talk to computer manufacturers and others, you\u2019re beginning to see a slowdown or a tempering of that activity.  The game has basically become a short yardage game, running up the middle, a cloud of dust, but still making forward progress on the field.  It\u2019s standard blocking and tackling, and I think the pace has slowed down, and, therefore, I have revised down my expectations for the second half. Every single businesswoman or man I speak to that is in a position of leadership describes the following circumstances.  They have gone back to basic blocking and tackling.  They are beset not just by concerns about demands for products, say, in weakening areas like Europe, but also by something we have not mentioned, which I will refer to as random refereeing\u2014that is, they beg for the huddle.  They say they\u2019re going to give Bronko Nagurski the ball, and the ref comes up and says, \u201cBy the way, this time the first down is 15 yards.\u201d  In other words, there is enormous uncertainty, which we discussed before, about the impact ofgovernment programs and regulation.  For example, one CEO reports that in the new health care bill there are 1,100 instances that are \u201cto be determined\u201d by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  There is no way you can cost out this random refereeing.  In the case of the casual dining sector, they estimate it will triple their personnel costs, or in the case of a large company like Exxon or AT&T, which has all the legal power in the world, they still cannot figure what the impact is going to be on the cost structure, which inhibits planning.  That is point number one. Point number two is that enormous cash build-up has taken place in the corporate sector.  According to the Wall Street Journal, which may or may not be reliable, the S&P 500 has built up $1.8 trillion in excess cash over the cash flow needs.  Every CEO or CFO I talk to has excess cash.  What are they doing with the excess cash.  They\u2019re either buying their own stock\u2014for example, Texas Instruments has bought 30 percent of its own stock\u2014or they\u2019re going to increase their dividend payments.  I\u2019m having a hard time finding people who are willing to add to their workforce until the random refereeing stops, until there is greater certainty.  I am also deeply disturbed by a phenomenon that I have reported before regarding cap-ex intentions\u2014if my contacts are going to expand plant and equipment, they don\u2019t plan to do it here. So, Mr. Chairman, I would say we still have inhibiting factors, including uncertainty, which stems from external developments and the lack of clarity as to rules and regulations that are likely to impact those who hire, especially the small business sector that doesn\u2019t have the resources that large corporations do to try to decipher what\u2019s coming out.  These factors are going to inhibit employment growth; at the same time, they will hold inflation at bay. In concluding, I\u2019d like to follow up on Sandy\u2019s comment on her staff\u2019s median CPI index and say that our trimmed mean index is, again, continuing to diminish and show less inflationary pressure.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN.  That\u2019s true.  Economic data releases since our April meeting have been consistent with the moderate recovery, but the turmoil in Europe with resulting deterioration in financial conditions during the intermeeting period pose substantial risks to economic growth and global financial stability going forward.  The timing could hardly be worse.  Monetary accommodation is stretched to the limit.  Fiscal policy is likely to turn more restrictive in many countries, and inflation is undesirably low and trending lower.  Like the Tealbook, I\u2019ve lowered my projection for economic growth.  The most recent data suggest some slowdown in consumerspending, and the moderation evident in the aggregate data accords with reports I\u2019m receiving from my business contacts.  Major retailers with whom we have spoken during the past month typically report that spending is flat or growing at only a very modest pace.  They hypothesize that the spending spurt that occurred earlier in the year reflected catch-up purchases by individuals who deferred buying discretionary items in 2009 due to uncertainty about their employment prospects.  With layoffs abating, those who are still employed apparently are less fearful about job loss. Looking ahead, both the deterioration in domestic financial conditions and the reduction in the outlook for foreign growth have caused me to trim my forecast for the second half of this year and next year.  I now expect real GDP to increase about 3\u00bd percent this year and a touch under 4 percent next year.  The prospect of subpar growth is likely to make the labor market recovery even more agonizingly slow that I previously expected.  I now anticipate that the unemployment rate will end this year at about 9\u00bd percent, declining only to 8\u00bd percent at the end of 2011 and will take a couple of additional years to return to full employment.  As Bill Wascher emphasized, long-term unemployment has now risen from its pre-recession level of about 1 percent to over 4 percent, and, as of May, 46 percent of the unemployed had been without a job for at least 27 weeks.  This is an extremely disconcerting situation, one that translates into tremendous hardship for families and that has potentially serious adverse long-term consequences. Turning to inflation, the very low recent readings on core consumer price inflation are worrisome.  I expect core PCE prices to rise about \u00be percent this year and a little below 1 percent next year.  Both figures are a touch below my April forecasts, reflecting the greater slack in labor and product markets I now expect and the effects of the stronger dollar.  Laborcompensation growth remains anemic.  Indeed, my business contacts report no sign of labor cost pressures outside of health and unemployment insurance.  The economy\u2019s substantial slack will continue to weigh on inflation, and the recent appreciation of the dollar should put some further downward pressure on prices.  Nonetheless, inflation expectations remain well anchored, which should put a floor on disinflation. Recent events in Europe have put to rest any thought I had that the risks to the outlook were diminishing to normal levels.  The very scary Tealbook simulation of the severe European sovereign debt crisis illustrates the scope of the potential downside dangers.  Another risk that concerns me, albeit a far less dramatic one, is that the underlying trend in productivity growth may be significantly stronger than either the Board staff or I have assumed.  The Tealbook forecast assumes that labor productivity growth will slow sharply from its recent rapid pace to a little above 1 percent this year and next.  This is well below the Board staff\u2019s estimate of structural productivity growth of 2 percent, and it reflects some payback from the extraordinary productivity gains of 2009 and early this year resulting from the reversal of strains on workers\u2014strains that will not prove sustainable. But such a productivity slowdown would represent a marked departure from the pattern of past recoveries.  Historically, labor productivity nearly always grows rapidly during the first two years of an expansion.  This is because measured productivity typically rises as firms increase the intensity with which they use capital and labor.  The sharply rising rate of capacity utilization expected over the next few years should, if anything, boost productivity growth, in contrast to the forecast in the Tealbook.  The prediction of slow productivity growth also appears inconsistent with what I have been hearing from my business contacts.  They tell me that recent productivity improvements, although born out of necessity, have become the new normal andreflect permanent changes in the way they do business.  To the extent that they\u2019re right, the level of structural productivity may be significantly higher than assumed in the Tealbook, and productivity growth over the next few years may be higher as well.  Such a situation is illustrated by the jobless recovery alternative simulation in the Tealbook that assumes that productivity growth will be about 2\u00bd percent this year and next, rather than 1 percent.  Of course, faster productivity growth is a good thing to the extent that it implies greater capacity to produce goods and services.  But the alternative simulation also shows that a stronger productivity trend would lead to significantly higher unemployment and lower inflation, outcomes that move us further away from our dual mandate goals. In summary, I still ascribe to the view that the economy is on a recovery path of moderate growth and very low inflation, but significant downside risks to the outlook have once again materialized and that implies that we should avoid altering policy in any way that could impede a fragile recovery", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you.  For me, the intermeeting period has largely been a tale of the tail.  A look at real economic data suggests some slowing, though not a sharp break with the pattern of recovery whose pace continues to be limited by the housing problems and balance sheet repairs that are the legacy of the financial crisis.  But as many of you have already suggested, a glance at financial indicators and conversations with market participants tell a different story, one of sharply renewed vulnerabilities and an associated flight to quality arising directly from the debt problems of the euro zone periphery and, more generally, from the long-term fiscal predicaments of many in the group of countries that we\u2019ve traditionally called the advanced economies. Nonfinancial data over the last seven weeks are largely consistent with what has become a reasonably well established but not particularly robust recovery.  As noted in the staff briefing, consumer spending, manufacturing, and investment in equipment and software remain solid.  But other indicators are not so favorable, and it seems less clear that self-sustaining economic activity will fully replace the waning effects of stimulus and inventory replenishment.  As evidenced by releases of the last two mornings, housing captures the broader picture well, both in that we do not see a run of more than a few good data points before less encouraging reports appear and in that there has been less good news lately. With respect to employment, there is, to be sure, still some reason to be hopeful about the jobs picture, notably increases in hours worked and some preliminary information suggestingthat any structural unemployment by-products of the recession may be limited.  But we\u2019ve had hopeful signs for some time now, and they\u2019ve translated into decent private sector job growth in only two months thus far.  Looking at projections that Bill distributed yesterday, the FOMC as a whole expects that unemployment two and a half years from now will still be a couple of percentage points above what we consider the long-run trend. Now to the tail:  Euro zone periphery problems have created obvious stresses, as revealed most palpably in the financial data presented by Nellie yesterday.  The uncertainty that results has been increased by continued disjointed policy response and communication problems among European policymakers.  Owing to the awkward structure of its economic policymaking, this awkwardness, I think, has been reflected in both the continued lack of elaboration on some particulars of how the SPV will function and, as many of you have noted, in continuing and recurring questions surrounding the bank stress test exercise.  A number of observers here and in Europe note that each time European policymakers take a leap ahead of the curve, they get bogged down in the challenges of coordinating the implementation of their initiatives, and they risk falling behind that curve once again.  It\u2019s possible to muddle through sovereign debt and banking sector problems, but history suggests that a failure to get ahead of these problems will often lead to grief. The uncertainties associated with the immediate risks of the sovereign debt and associated banking problems are bad enough.  Then we have the view, which I\u2019ve heard from a number of market participants, that virtually any policy chosen in Europe will be a bad one.  Credible fiscal consolidation will be good for reassuring the financial system but, quite possibly, bad for economic growth.  Failure to move forward on credible fiscal consolidation may be helpful in the short term but will compound the medium-term problems and, quite possibly, leadto a steepening of yield curves sooner rather than later.  Finding the right balance and timing of policies will obviously be a challenge, not to mention the coordination difficulties. In terms of my own expectations, starting with my modal expectation, the effect of the euro zone problems on risk aversion, exports, and equity values will be only partially offset by lower Treasury rates and commodity prices.  This expectation led me to pare somewhat my projections for GDP growth in the remainder of this year and 2011, though not as much as the Tealbook, and that\u2019s in part because I never expected growth as high as the Greenbook had foreseen before its recent change of hue.  My modal forecast is not too optimistic to begin with.  Add to that the tail risk of a financial event in Europe\u2014and I think we can have a disruptive financial event that falls short of a full-blown crisis\u2014and we see at least some potential for renewed asset value and credit strains in the United States with a resulting significant negative effect on economic performance.  So here\u2019s hoping the tail doesn\u2019t wag the dog.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The Tealbook has a higher unemployment rate at the end of 2010 and 2011 than at our previous meeting.  It also has a lower core inflation rate at the end of 2010 and 2011 than at our previous meeting.  This forecast is very limited improvement in the very large miss on our unemployment mandate,and we move further away from reaching a goal of 2 percent inflation.  My own forecast has moved in the same direction.  As a result, I view any tightening through language or asset sales as moving in the wrong direction.  Like the staff, I do not see much likelihood that we should tighten policy in 2010 or 2011. I would note that key phrases in alternative A provide a description of the outlook and its relation to our goals that seems better aligned with the staff forecast and with my own outlook.  In particular, alternative A highlights the fact that the outlook has weakened somewhat, and emphasizes that inflation is likely to remain below, and maybe well below, rates consistent with our dual mandate.  Should we experience further weakness and disinflation, we may want to move to language closer to that expressed in alternative A at future meetings.  In fact, I am concerned that we should be doing more contingency planning with a possibility that deflation or financial contagion from Europe could move from the risk to the outcome column.  While we were quite innovative during the financial crisis, should these risks become a reality, our creativity may once again be tested.  In terms of the coupon swaps, I view it as a technical matter.  As a result, I think making an announcement of a technical matter is fine", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor the policy actions in alternative B, but not necessarily all of the language.  Alternative B, as drafted, does not seem to me to reflect either what I described as my modal projection or the tail risks that many of us have talked about.  With respect to the tail risks, I am not sure it would be particularly helpful to specify those in our statement, and they will be evident in the minutes when they\u2019re released in a few weeks.  But, with respect to the projections of the economy, I think that there was a palpable change in the attitude of the Committee, and I agree with Kevin that alternative B, paragraph 1, is rather more upbeat than either the Tealbook forecast or what most of us had to say around the table.  Initially, I was going to say I just favor the language in alternative A, but I only see two differences between A and B, one of which is the insertion of \u201cin recent months\u201d to \u201cbank lending has continued to contract,\u201d and that doesn\u2019t strike me as a salient difference.  So I would favor more particularly the substitution of the last sentence of paragraph 1 in alternative A for the last sentence of paragraph 1 of alternative B.  I thought that the effort in the first red insertion in paragraph 3 of alternative A\u2014if I understand it correctly\u2014to try to specify a bit more our reaction function was and is an interesting and good effort.  I don\u2019t think the language quitecaptures probably what all of us would agree to, but I think it would be worth doing more along those lines for the next couple of meetings. The only other thing I\u2019d say, Mr. Chairman, is in support of my argument for the sentence change in the first paragraph.  I recall the debate last year, which included, to some degree, people around this table, between those who said that the mixed data we were seeing at the time were eminently characteristic of the early stages of a pretty strong recovery, and that we would pretty soon see things converging around stronger data more or less across the board, and those who predicted that this was going to be a halting recovery in which there were going to be potholes, or headwinds, or some other metaphor, looking out a fair time into the future, and thus we are going to continue to see a pattern that was sort of two steps forward, one step back. I think that, nine months later, that debate has been, at least in the medium term, clearly decided in favor of the latter camp.  So I think we\u2019ve got to come to grips with the fact that, even in the modal forecast, this is not a lot of strength, and this does not promise anything close to the achievement of at least one side of the dual mandate, and, I suspect, increasingly, both sides of the dual mandate.  I don\u2019t know how many years it takes before the high levels of unemployment that we all project constitute the long run rather than the short run.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B, and I\u2019m fine with the coupon swap as proposed by the staff.  That said, it wouldn\u2019t take much in terms of weaker economic data, lower inflation, and further financial market distress for me to prefer alternative A.  I am concerned, in particular, that any significant weakening in the economic data from here could raise fears of a double dip, and that, in turn, might increase the risk of further risk aversion and a further tightening of financial conditions, which would actuallymake the double dip more likely.  I think that, in those circumstances, alternative A would be appropriate.  I\u2019m not quite there yet, but it wouldn\u2019t take much to push me there. If economic conditions deteriorated and financial markets were to tighten, it would be important at that stage for the FOMC to show that our toolbox was not empty and that we were still willing and able to act to lean against such developments.  I think a failure to act at that particular point would be quite dangerous, because it would reinforce fears that there was limited scope for further economic policy support, and that would create even greater fears of a double dip.  In terms of escalation, I think we\u2019ve laid out what the options are:  We could stop redemptions of agency MBS, we could restart a purchase program of Treasuries and/or agency MBS, we could change the language in the statement to try to commit to lower short-term rates for a longer period of time, or we could cut the IOER rate. I think the bar to reinvesting maturing agency MBS should be pretty low, because that\u2019s really just maintaining the status quo.  Letting the agency MBS run off is essentially a de facto\u2014very modest but, still, de facto\u2014tightening of policy over time.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be very stressful on the economy, but I don\u2019t think the bar to reinvesting the agency MBS should be very high.  I do agree with Governor Warsh and others that bar to expanding the balance sheet should be considerably higher for a whole variety of reasons. In terms of changing the language, although it\u2019s an option, I don\u2019t have any really great ideas that I think would be particularly helpful.  \u201cExtraordinarily low for an extended period\u201d is already pretty strong, and the market doesn\u2019t seem to be off base in their expectations relative to our own expectations.  I suppose we could commit to some sort of price level target, so that any undershooting on inflation over the next couple of years would be reversed down the road, but, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, I think that has real communication difficulties right now.In terms of the interest on excess reserves that Governor Kohn raised as a potential option, I think it certainly should be examined, and I\u2019d like to see a little bit more work done on what the costs and benefits of that are; that is, how much market dysfunction we\u2019d create by cutting the IOER rate further versus what the benefits would be in terms of the signal that we would be sending to markets.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It\u2019s creating an unnecessary ambiguity, I think"], "2010FOMC20100810meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  The Tealbook reports that you estimate that the extended and emergency unemployment benefits are boosting the unemployment rate by approximately 1 percentage point right now.  That effect has increased over the last 18 months.  Some of this effect, as you report in footnote 5, represents workers who you believe would otherwise be out of the labor force, and some represents workers who would otherwise accept job offers.  I was wondering if you\u2019re willing to take a stab at the decomposition", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser, B2 is still effectively there in the sense that paragraph 4 can be excluded", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After reviewing the recent data and insights from my business contacts, I still believe the U.S. economic recovery is continuing, but the near-term and medium-term economic growth prospects seem very modest.  Yes, I can recount several positives from my business reports.  Revenues at heavy equipment manufacturers, Deere and Caterpillar, have risen sharply on the strength of foreign demand, especially from emerging markets.  Manufacturing segments with exposures to the auto sector have also rebounded well, although overall sales and production levels are well below previous business cycle peaks.  Corporate America is flying more business travelers overseas again to support strong activity, and the European financial crisis continues to recede.  Indeed, Europe\u2019s growth prospects have not cratered as I had feared. But there are clear signs of heightened uncertainty and waning momentum in the U.S.  One manufacturing supplier with a broad business base described how non-auto-related customers were pulling back in the last two months.  This is especially evident in those products related to cap-ex that they believe are early indicators of trend shifts.  With the continuing corporate emphasis on productivity gains, businesses are quick to mention that the hurdle for meaningful hiring is very high.  As one CEO stated, \u201cWhile firms might increase hours, hiring new workers is just a totally different proposition.\u201d  In my directors\u2019 phone call last week, the mood was grim.  One of our great hopes is for banks to begin lending out their vast reserves to fund growing activity, but all I hear frombankers is that businesses and consumers are pulling back on their activities.  My large bank director complained that the psychology of the general economy is poor.  Consequently, it doesn\u2019t seem that increased bank lending is going to happen any time soon.  Similarly, although the big temporary employment firms headquartered in our District report that their business has held up fairly well, they say that client firms are increasingly cautious about the uncertain economic outlook.  Another CEO put it this way:  \u201cIt all comes back to jobs.\u201d In light of these developments, I have no substantial disagreements regarding the outlook presented in the Tealbook.  With each passing meeting, it is becoming all too clear that the modest pace of economic recovery will be too slow to return the labor market to anything close to normalcy by 2012.  With the unemployment rate projected to be 7\u00bd to 8 percent in 2012, we\u2019re falling far short of our objectives for the real economy.  Remember, this is the third anniversary of when this all began, this very meeting\u2014we\u2019ll be five years on in 2012. I recognize that there are caveats.  Some unemployment is likely structural and requires costly reallocation across industries, skills, and regions.  This reallocation may be particularly important for sectors like housing, which grew to unsustainable levels.  Associated capital reallocation could lower overall potential output.  Still, these structural factors seem relatively small compared with the current level of unemployment. The other disturbing policy development is that we are underrunning our inflation objective.  Mr. Chairman, on this subject the Committee is in a difficult situation, because we do not have a uniform view on an explicit numerical inflation objective.  That has been already voiced this morning.  Nevertheless, by my reckoning, with the Tealbook\u2019s core PCE inflation projection of 1 percent in 2012, we\u2019re failing by a full percentage point; that is, I have 2 percent as my price stability goal.  If an inflation rate of 1 percent is not a problem, as some haveindicated, then, by symmetry, we should feel the same way about an inflation rate of 3 percent.  I somehow doubt that that\u2019s the case. We\u2019re failing on both dimensions of the dual mandate.  We face both unemployment that is too high and inflation that is too low.  This is not a new development due to recent weak data\u2014that\u2019s my assessment.  It\u2019s a growing realization of the dilemma we face, in my opinion.  The state of affairs should focus us squarely on what more we can do to stimulate demand.  For me, given the lack of conflict between our dual objectives, it\u2019s hard to see why we wouldn\u2019t want to take some significant and meaningful additional measures.  But I\u2019ll hold off saying more until the policy go-round.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  With externally bred tail risks in retreat, at least for the present, we\u2019ve all turned our attention again to the key question underlying medium-term economic projections, namely, whether final sources of private demand will become sufficiently self-sustaining to substitute for the waning effects of fiscal stimulus, the absence of further monetary stimulus, and the completion of major inventory replenishment. While it is perhaps too soon to answer this question definitively, the handoff has clearly not gone smoothly.  The prevailing story last spring of a well-established recovery gradually gaining momentum is considerably harder, though not impossible, to tell persuasively.  Indeed, against the backdrop of the generally disappointing data of the last couple of months, it seems to me that the downward revision to estimates of second-quarter economic growth renders quite credible a reading of the last year as a burst of stimulus-induced activity in an environment of decreasing financial instability followed by lackluster growth in the face of continued balance sheet repairs, business model adjustments, and shaky business and consumer confidence. Such a reading is supported by numerous factors already mentioned by a number of our colleagues.  In particular, a close look at employment data shows that there has been no net improvement over the last 12 months.  In fact, we have gone backwards.  From July 2009 to July 2010, the working-age population of the United States increased by about two million.  In that same time frame, the number of employed people in the country decreased by roughly 900,000.  After increasing in the early part of the year, the total number of people employed has declined abit in each of the last three months.  The gains in hours worked earlier this year have been maintained but have shown some signs of abating except, possibly, in manufacturing.  After nine months of increases, temporary employment also fell last month.  In July, the labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratios had given up the modest improvements seen in the spring and were just about where they were at the end of last year, hovering at levels lower than any time since the early 1980s.  Of the six alternative measures of labor underutilization used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which incorporate factors such as discouraged workers and longer-term unemployment, five have increased since last July. Still, this is the past and the present I\u2019ve been describing.  Are there reasons to expect an acceleration of the painfully slow pace of recovery over the next few quarters.  Or, more to the point, are there reasons better than those adduced earlier this year in support of projections of stronger growth, which turned out to have been erroneous or at least premature. The factor most frequently mentioned is that financial conditions have improved considerably since last year.  The tightening of credit terms, as Betsy described, appears to be coming to an end, and the decline in bank lending has slowed considerably.  Large companies have apparently taken advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to reduce their interest expenses.  All of this is true, but it describes not an impetus for faster economic growth, but the conditions that would permit faster growth if the impetus comes from another source.  The same large companies that have so successfully accessed public debt markets are sitting on large amounts of cash, which they will continue to do until they see the promise of increased demand that would warrant investment in new capacity.  Small businesses have the same view, as reflected in the survey released this morning.I want to digress for just a moment to say a word about policy uncertainty and skill mismatches as potential sources of suppressed job creation.  While both undoubtedly play some role today, neither approach is as important as the most important uncertainty, namely, that of future demand for goods and services.  Health care costs are undoubtedly an issue and are likely to continue to be so for the indefinite future.  With respect to job mismatches, I\u2019m not sure, Narayana, that a moderate uptick in job openings from near depression levels to the level that was the lowest of the previous ten years constitutes a real mismatch problem.  As the recovery moves on, we are going to see mismatches.  But right now the basic problem is aggregate demand.  And in response to the JOLTS point, I just note that the survey of hard-to-fill positions indicates that they are at historic lows in small businesses. Other factors cited as grounds for relative optimism include improving export performance, possible release of pent-up demand as consumer confidence improves, a decline in what turns out, after all, to have been significantly increased saving rates once consumers have paid off most of their debt, stronger than expected growth in some foreign markets, the continued recovery in manufacturing following the carnage that began a couple of years ago, and an end to the unusually high productivity growth during the recession. One might question at least parts of each of these mostly benign possibilities.  But even if we grant them all, we\u2019re almost surely looking at no more than the kind of moderately above-trend growth that was the central tendency of this Committee not so long ago.  And, as seen in the forecasts of even the most optimistic of the Blue Chip forecasters, that translates, at best, into an unemployment rate of about 8\u00bd percent at the end of next year, a figure that I strongly suspect would itself mask a continued low employment-to-population ratio.With this employment picture, it seems exceedingly difficult to give a plausible account of medium-term rapid economic growth of a sort that would propel us beyond where we would be had trend growth continued through the last few years.  Thus, even allowing for some increase in the NAIRU, and some reduction in productive capacity, the only truly open question now seems to be whether the economy will be moderately or badly underperforming for the foreseeable future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. DUKE.  I have a question on the note about replacing the maturities.  It looked to me that there was a dollar amount anticipated of somewhere between $240 and $540 billion, and so in calculating the basis-point effect on longer-term rates, what sort of stock does that imply.  What total dollar amount of purchases does that imply.  How long does that imply that we continue to reinvest.  And, finally, how does the market know that that\u2019s the dollar amount that we\u2019re going to reinvest and the time commitment\u2014if that question makes sense", " MR. SACK.  It\u2019s difficult, obviously, to calibrate the cost precisely, but I will say I do have some concerns about rolling over into MBS.  We can design the program to be as gentle as possible.  I think that means sticking to production coupons, smoothing purchases as much as we can, probably going back into a dollar roll book, or maybe even coupon swaps.  We can take a number of steps, but we clearly risk putting more strain on the MBS market.  Calibrating that strain is hard, as I mentioned in my briefing.  When we look at the market, there\u2019s a lot of mixed evidence.  For example, trading in the production coupons seems okay, that is, it\u2019s not significantly impaired, yet, at the same time, we have these settlement problems, and everyone\u2019s concerned that at some point they\u2019re going to come back to bite market functioning. So rolling over into MBS would risk putting more strain on the market.  I also think it creates a risk of damaging our reputation with market participants, at least in those circles around MBS markets.  We\u2019ve tried to be as responsible as possible to market functioning in the context of this large program, but, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of attention on the fails and on the role we\u2019ve played in market functioning, and I worry that going back into the MBS market may be seen as being a bit out of touch with some of those strains.  I think there probably are risks.  They are hard to calibrate.  One other thing that might lead you to a second set of Treasury purchases isthat the portfolio balance effects, in our view, are nearly equivalent, given that you\u2019re removing the same amount of duration from the market in either case", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I just want to say that we do have a policy tool\u2014one that has theoretical support, and one that we\u2019re all talking about\u2014and that tool is shifts in the promise to stay low for longer.  We can promise to stay low for a year or for 18 months or for two years, and, at least in the theoretical world, that\u2019s supposed to work just fine as a policy tool. My view is that we should not continue to react to negative shocks solely by promising to delay the date of policy rate normalization.  My argument is that such a policy, as useful as it might be, also has some severe drawbacks, which I outlined in my paper.  I advocate augmenting the near-zero rate policy with an enhanced quantitative easing policy, and I see alternative B as away to signal our intentions to defend our implicit inflation target on the low side and to avoid getting too close to a Japanese-type outcome here in the U.S.  I think we need to send that signal at this juncture.  We may not need to do more\u2014I actually think the most likely outcome is that this turns out to be a rough patch in the recovery and that we do get better levels of economic activity going forward.  But that remains to be seen. I support paragraph 4 with the longer-term Treasuries provision.  I think going with the MBS reinvestments would not be very effective at this point.  Buying longer-dated Treasuries is likely to keep inflation and inflation expectations closer to target, even if the Committee is unlucky enough to face a new round of negative shocks.  Also, a decision to go with Treasuries moves us closer to our longer-run goal of having a Treasuries-only portfolio.  I think paragraph 4 indicates that we are willing to use balance sheet policy in a more state-contingent way, something that I have advocated repeatedly at these meetings.  Also, if the recovery proceeds at a stronger pace than we currently anticipate, I think the reinvestment policy can simply be changed back to one that allows runoff or even outright asset sales, should inflation and inflation expectations pick up appreciably. In paragraph 2, regarding the clause \u201cat levels lower than are desirable in the long run,\u201d I appreciate Governor Kohn\u2019s explanation, but I actually read this a little differently.  I would not include this.  I think our action today has the potential, I hope, to move inflation and inflation expectations closer to target.  This wording sort of suggests that our policy won\u2019t be effective in doing that, so it\u2019s a little counterproductive, possibly.  But maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it.  I don\u2019t have really strong feelings on this. Let me make one last point, and then I\u2019ll finish.  Let me stress that I do not advocate a shock-and-awe policy, that is, a large purchase of Treasury securities all at once.  That\u2019s the kindof thing that you should only do in a crisis environment, because a large purchase strategy is very risky\u2014it can fall flat and end up damaging our credibility.  My view is that the crisis atmosphere for that type of move has passed.  Instead, I would advocate adopting a firm and determined asset purchase response, commensurate with risk levels as we judge them around the table, and then we can adjust our policy as appropriate going forward, both on the positive and the negative side.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B without paragraph 4.  I\u2019m opposed to paragraph 4 of alternative B, because it recommends additional purchases of Treasuries.  Why do people want to do these extra purchases.  I think there are two reasons.  One is that they\u2019re hoping to combat deflation or disinflation by doing this, and I don\u2019t think that this will be effective.  I think the situation we\u2019re in right now with our monetary base is akin to something like the following.  We\u2019ve got a child and some cake.  I think everyone around the table would be happy if the child ate one slice of cake, maybe even two slices of cake.  But those of us who are worried about inflation are worried about the child eating a whole cake, and, actually, there are a dozen cakes in front of this child.  This is the situation with reserves right now.  We\u2019re talking about adding a 13th cake.  It\u2019s not going to add much.  I\u2019m not worried about extra inflation risks from this 13th cake, but, at the same time I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have much effect on disinflation.  The only thing I will say about this is that it\u2019s moving in the wrong direction.  The right direction in terms of controlling inflation risk, making sure that, as President Lacker was saying, we\u2019re able to follow the right kinds of policies to ensure that we don\u2019t have undue amounts of inflation, is to shrink the balance sheet.The other reason I think people are interested in doing this is that they hope it\u2019s a way to stimulate the economy.  We are in a very poor situation in terms of the real economy\u20149\u00bd percent unemployment and very high persistence in that rate.  This is not a good situation.  Unfortunately, while I agree that our purchase of nearly $2 trillion of agency securities and Treasury debt drove down the term premium and served to stimulate the economy in late 2008 and early 2009, I don\u2019t think that further purchases now would be able to drive down the term premium.  We were able to influence the term premium in that period because liquidity problems in the underlying markets made cross-market arbitrages difficult.  Markets are not illiquid in 2010, so our ability to influence the term premium is going to be slight or nonexistent during this period. I\u2019ll give you one teeny piece of evidence along these lines from the very recent past.  As the Board staff\u2019s work acknowledges very clearly, the evidence we do have is largely based on the earlier period, when markets were impaired.  On August 2, 2010, the difference between the 10-year yield and the 2-year yield was 243 basis points.  On August 3, 2010, The Wall Street Journal online had an article on predictions about what we were going to do, and it essentially predicted that we might well engage in these kinds of purchases.  On August 3, the difference between the 10-year yield and two-year yield fell from 243 to 241\u2014two basis points.  The next day it went back up to 242 basis points.  So that release of information, in itself, which was a surprise to me\u2014I can\u2019t say how much of a surprise it was to others\u2014did not seem to have much of an effect on markets. I think there\u2019s useful analogy to be drawn.  I\u2019d say we all agree that we cannot stimulate the economy effectively in 2010 by restarting the TAF or the CPFF.  Those programs worked by improving impaired market function in 2008 and 2009, and those markets are not impaired in2010.  It\u2019s for exactly the same reasons that we should not be thinking we can stimulate effectively now by buying more Treasuries.  Governor Kohn raised a great point about expectational effects, and I do agree that we should be able to have a stimulative impact by influencing people\u2019s forecasts of future short rates.  But I would much prefer to do that through language as opposed to actual purchases of Treasuries. What I hear around the table is a great deal of unhappiness with the state of the American economy, and I share that absolutely.  But I think what we should be resisting is the view that the Federal Reserve is the right vehicle to fight this situation.  We\u2019re not.  If this is going to be fought, it\u2019s going to have to be done by somebody else\u2014we\u2019re not the ones who have those choices to make.  But there are tools available.  There\u2019s work going on at the Minneapolis Fed about how we can mimic negative nominal interest rates through cutting consumption taxes that would stimulate consumption demand\u2014that would be one way to proceed.  But that\u2019s not our job.  The right way to try to get around the fact that we\u2019re at the zero lower bound is through the use of other policy tools, not through monetary policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I obviously would prefer something closer to option C.  I don\u2019t see it on the table, so I won\u2019t wordsmith it.  I would just say that the economy is improving\u2014we keep saying that.  I believe that if we allow ourselves to think far enough ahead, we can follow my proposal and explain to the public that we\u2019re leaving policy highly accommodative but away from zero; that is, it would be 1 percent over a period, then a pause while we see how the economy is doing, and so on.  I think we can do it without shocking the economy or the public.  To ease policy in an improving economy, as we are proposing here, is, I think, unwise.And I do not support rolling over principal payments into Treasuries or anything else.  We have an opportunity to allow our extraordinary easing policy from an earlier period to decline gradually on its own, without major disruptions to the market, and we\u2019re passing that opportunity up with the view that we\u2019re taking out an insurance policy.  But I think of it more as planting the seeds of a briar patch that we will have to deal with not a year from now, but three or four years from now, as we have in the past.  So I very much oppose this policy", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, in thinking of all the things I\u2019ve heard around this table today\u2014in addition to what I call \u201cgood news for Lutherans,\u201d which is the economic growth that you\u2019re experiencing here in the D.C. area and the low unemployment rate in Minnesota\u2014let me just mention two that are of concern to me. One is the constant reference to the Japanese deflationary trap.  For what it\u2019s worth, I have some familiarity with Japan, as I co-chaired on behalf of Prime Minister Hashimoto and President Clinton what was called the \u201cU.S.\u2013Japan Enhanced Initiative on Competition and Deregulation.\u201d  To be sure, there were monetary factors involved in the deflation trap, but there were also gross fiscal errors made by the Japanese government.  One was raising the sales tax in 1997, and another was the inability to reform the banking system, because of what is known as \u201camakudari,\u201d which means basically that the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance officials went back to the banks and influenced the authorities not to bring about the kind of reforms that we just brought about.  I think the cumulative effect of those fiscal initiatives, as well as the monetary initiatives, was a consumer shift to perpetual thrift.  So one point I want to raise a cautionary flag about is that we should be careful that we don\u2019t constantly refer to the United States falling into the Japanese deflationary trap.  Our conditions are totally different.  Yet, to besure, none of us do want to have deflation.  And, to be sure, all of us want to see higher employment and lesser unemployment, more jobs for the American people.  That\u2019s part of our mandate. The other thing is that I heard the following statements made around the table:  from Brian, \u201cI don\u2019t think capital markets are imposing a constraint\u201d; from Larry, \u201cfinancial conditions appear slightly more supportive of economic growth than in June\u201d; from Governor Duke, \u201cloan growth does not seem to be constrained by capital, liquidity, or funding,\u201d or whatever the third descriptor was; from Governor Warsh, \u201ccredit has turned in the United States\u201d; from President Lacker, \u201cwe have effectively eased.\u201d  And then, of course, as was pointed out just now by President Kocherlakota\u2014that we cannot depend on the Fed to solve all our problems.  He also gave us a good discourse on the Beveridge curve, and that it was unlikely that monetary policy might shift unemployment because there had been a shift in the Beveridge curve.  And then, lastly, from President Rosengren, \u201cfiscal policy is a more effective tool.\u201d I\u2019m very worried, Mr. Chairman, that we are at risk of pushing on a string.  We have done an awful lot.  We have earned an enormous amount of credibility.  I think we have been quite effective in what we have done.  But I am worried about what signals we send when there is a question as to how much return we\u2019re going to get from the kind of policy that\u2019s advocated in alternative B.  Will it be only 20 basis points, or 10 basis points, and at a time when there is, as we have seen through the testimony of people around this table, a significant amount of access to liquidity.  Not only have rates come down in response to declines in the Treasury rates, but, very importantly, the spreads have narrowed, so that the issuance calendar for publicly traded corporations is quite high, and access to capital for those private companies is at least increasing, not decreasing.I\u2019m not a voter this time around.  However, I would caution against adopting alternative B, with paragraph 4 in particular\u2014I know this is a little bit cheeky, but  it will make Bill Gross happy\u2014and I don\u2019t think it is going to do much in terms of its effectiveness.  In fact, it might do damage to our credibility, particularly if it comes to be viewed as our accommodating the fiscal authorities, who have to get it right.  I think we\u2019re relying far too much on the Federal Reserve in this case.  If anything, we\u2019re taking the pressure off the fiscal authorities to get their stimulative policies and their regulatory regime correct.  Whether or not my reports from the private sector are sour grapes in terms of random refereeing, the fact is that we do have an inefficient fiscal response.  If we\u2019re going to turn to the Japanese as an example, that\u2019s one of the causes of the situation they found themselves in.  And I would be very hesitant to be an accomplice to not adopting the most efficient policy possible.  And I do not believe that the course of action recommended in alternative B is the most effective course of action.  But, having said that, I don\u2019t have a vote, and I just wanted to offer those views", "   MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am prepared to support alternative B, but I have real reservations about the actions in paragraph 4.  I don\u2019t think I disagree at all with the comments about the outlook that have been expressed, but I think my reservation comes regarding estimates of how well the tools that are available to us will work and the threshold for using them.  I don\u2019t think this action will alter either the outlook or the outcome in any appreciable way.  So my reservation is not a concern about keeping our powder dry, but a concern that our remaining ammunition is much less effective than we can claim when its use is only in the potential.   In thinking about this, I\u2019m reminded of the old admonition that I heed too infrequently which is, \u201cit is better to be silent and be thought stupid than to speak and remove all doubt.\u201d  [Laughter]  Nevertheless, I\u2019m going to continue.  We are currently in a \u201csilent\u201d position, which I think is stronger, in that we can be perceived as having tools whose effectiveness may be debatable but that, in any case, we\u2019re reluctant to use, rather than the other position, namely, using the tools, finding that they\u2019re not effective, and removing all doubt about that.In addition, I\u2019m concerned about possible alternative interpretations of our actions.  The rationale section in the Tealbook said that this would lead investors to believe that policymakers are less focused on exit and more concerned about spurring growth.  I\u2019d suggest a few interpretations that in my mind could be even more harmful to confidence than any positive result from the actions themselves.  First, the press has tied this decision to the unemployment results, so it could suggest a reaction function that creates an expectation for expanded purchases to support employment whenever the results are weak.  And I think the \u201cto help support\u201d language that begins paragraph 4 reinforces that.  Second, because this announcement is going to be released without any updated projections, it could suggest a concern about the future that\u2019s even direr than our projections indicate and fuel suspicions that we now anticipate a double dip.  And, finally, as I said, if the tools that we have do turn out to be pretty weak, it will prove them to be so and could undermine confidence in our ability to fight a more serious weakening in the outlook.  We could yet face conditions that will force us to start using the remaining tools in our arsenal, but, because I read this more as a commitment to purchase $400 billion in Treasury securities by the end of 2011, the threshold for making that decision is higher than the conditions in front of us.  All that being said, I am prepared to support it", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I will try to pull myself together here.  Thank you for the comments.  Despite the reservations and concerns I\u2019ve heard around the table, I believe that the right step is alternative B, to reinvest in Treasuries.  Let me try to explain why. First of all, as I said, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at monthly noise.  I think there has been a weakening in the outlook, which might be acceptable, if everything were linear in the world, but my own belief is that there are nonlinearities, including the nonlinearity of policy, and I think that raises the risk of a truly unacceptable outcome, one that would have long-term consequencesfor our labor force and for our economy.  I think that it\u2019s quite a serious concern and that we need to pay attention to it. Second, and this is what very much puzzles me about the discussion around the table, is that, even if you are a pure inflation targeter and don\u2019t give a damn about unemployment, we are too tight.  All of our nominal variables are coming in below target\u2014we are forecasting inflation that is too low.  Again, I don\u2019t understand President Plosser\u2019s concern about fine-tuning\u2014I think that any inflation targeting central bank, given the forecast we have, would try to find a way to ease policy.  So that seems to me to be right from that perspective. For me, the difficulty has been rationalizing having both parts of our mandate falling short of the target on the same side.  So, again, I don\u2019t understand that argument. Regarding the argument that President Bullard has raised, which is to try to be proactive and to try to indicate our strong commitment, I think that will be helpful for confidence and for expectations.  Let me add that I do believe that the effects of this policy will work through mechanisms over and above the 20 basis points\u2014the estimate that keeps getting referred to.  I think there are other financial channels.  There are risk preference and term premium channels, potentially credit availability channels, confidence, expectations, and a variety of other things.  This action may not be very effective, but I suspect that it will have some effect\u2014we\u2019ll have to see. Some people argue that we shouldn\u2019t do the reinvestment because it won\u2019t be effective, and some seem to be arguing that we shouldn\u2019t do it because it will be too effective.  So I honestly am a little puzzled on that.  It seems to me, as I said, that we are on the wrong side of our objectives, that we are to blame if we don\u2019t make whatever effort we can.  Now, it may not work, but, if the economy is in near deflation six months from now, I would rather say that theFed did what it could to prevent it rather than saying the Fed stood around and let things happen.  So there are errors in both directions and concerns in both directions, but I think we ought to try to do what we can do even if it isn\u2019t necessarily going to be fully effective or solve the problem. That ties to the other question about the Fed not being in some sense the optimal agency to solve the problem.  Clearly, we\u2019d like to have better fiscal policy.  Clearly, we\u2019d like to have better regulatory policy.  There are many things that we would like to see done better.  Sure, the Fed cannot solve the problem.  But it is, I think, incumbent upon us to do what we can do and, in particular, we are responsible for the inflation rate, and the inflation rate is evidently too low. In sum, I guess I\u2019m still not persuaded by the arguments I\u2019ve heard, although I recognize that this is not without its risks, and, in particular, how it would be interpreted.  I think Governor Warsh and President Fisher were correct that there were some expectational issues related to our earlier purchases of Treasuries.  I think there are some risks there.  On the other hand, to some extent we want to increase inflation expectations, so it\u2019s a tricky act, I have to admit.  Therefore, having heard what people around the table said, again, my preference would be alternative B with Treasuries. There was a lot of discussion about what this signals.  I am becoming a Bullard acolyte in the following sense:  The next time we do anything, I don\u2019t think we should go out and say, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going $400 billion of Treasuries.\u201d  I think we ought to have a framework that says, \u201cHere\u2019s our objective.\u201d  And then we say that we\u2019re trying to achieve an inflation rate, or a price level target or a nominal GDP target or something, and that we are going to calibrate our purchases or sales in a way that tries to reach that target.  That would create some structure, and that would take away this perception that periodically we\u2019re going to go out and do a shock-and- awe action.  Having said that, I think that we really need to see how this works and what benefitit has, if any.  So barring some major change in the outlook\u2014and I do want us to think about our tools, I do want us to think about our framework\u2014I don\u2019t anticipate bringing another large step back to the Committee. On the language in the statement, President Lockhart made a couple of suggestions, although, President Lockhart, you didn\u2019t really have specific language suggestions", "  MR. KOHN.  I would defer to your judgment, Mr. Chairman.  Given that we\u2019re adopting paragraph 4, if you\u2019re nervous about this phrase at the end of paragraph 2, I\u2019d rather have you comfortable than have the phrase included.  You can resurrect the phrase in October, perhaps, when you have another round of forecasts.  I think it\u2019s an important point", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So you\u2019re in favor of not doing it", " MR. WARSH.  Mr. Chairman, if you leave the first phrase as it is, and then, instead of \u201cmaintain,\u201d because we\u2019re trying to strengthen that a little bit, we might say \u201cThe Committee will keep constant the Federal Reserve\u2019s holdings.\u201d  I know that means \u201cmaintain,\u201d but \u201ckeep constant\u201d sounds a little bit more affirmative to me.  It sounds a little more like this is a discrete act about making sure we deal with this a bit"], "2010FOMC20100921meeting.txt": [" CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We\u2019re making progress, and we hope to come to a resolution at some point. Before we get started, I wanted to address an issue that came up during the intermeeting period relating to the preparation of the minutes.  One of our colleagues raised a concern that the first draft of the minutes this time didn\u2019t fully reflect the discussion at the meeting, and I wanted to explain what happened and what we did about it.  The background is that, based on longstanding tradition and reflecting the Federal Reserve Act\u2019s requirement that we explain why the Committee took the action it did, we have always had a so-called \u201cpolicy paragraph,\u201d which explains the action taken by the Committee and gives the specific reasons cited by the members, that is, the voters, for their support of that decision.  Normally, there\u2019s no issue, becausegenerally there\u2019s a substantial overlap of views between the voting members and nonvoting members, and we\u2019re able to represent the full range of the discussion.  But in the first round of the review of the minutes from the last meeting, it was felt that that was not the case. I\u2019ve had some discussions with Scott and with the Secretariat.  This matter was actually raised at the December 2004 FOMC meeting, when we discussed the more rapid turnaround of the minutes.  There\u2019s a very longstanding tradition of restricting that paragraph to the views of the members. That being said, I certainly believe, and I\u2019m sure that we all agree, that the minutes ought to reflect the full range of discussion at the table and not just the views of those who happen to be in the voting cycle.  We were able to do that this time by looking for overlaps between views expressed by participants and members, by including additional material, and so on.  So let me just assure everybody that we will continue to maintain the principle that the full range of views should be reflected in the minutes, and we will find ways to do that. I think changing the current structure of the minutes is something we would not do lightly.  It\u2019s a very longstanding tradition, and if we want to change it, I think we need to have a fuller discussion.  President Plosser, do you want to comment.  If anyone wants to comment, I can take one or two comments, but if we want to go into this in greater detail, we probably need to put it on the agenda for a future meeting.   Do you want to make a comment", " MR. SACK.  Considerations of large expansions of the balance sheet and large purchases of Treasury securities, of course, raise this issue.  I don\u2019t think we have a clear sense of a threshold or a trigger, but I\u2019ll note a couple things.  LSAPs in the range of $500 billion to $1 trillion put us up around or possibly above the 24 percent figure of where we are for MBS. Having said that, I think it\u2019s hard to make that comparison directly, because, underlying that 24 percent figure for MBS, we have holdings of certain coupons that are extremely concentrated\u2014we still own 60 to 75 percent of the entire outstanding amount of the 4 and the 4.5 coupons.  My guess is that, if Treasury purchases are distributed across the entire curve, we could actually push those readings higher before we get into significant problems with market function, but that will depend very much on how we buy, at what pace we buy, and what maturities the FOMC wants to target.  So I think the short answer is that we think we have considerable room, but if we\u2019re going to consider very large LSAPs, then that definitely becomes a relevant consideration", " MR. BULLARD.  Let me sharpen this up a little.  Suppose you said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to buy all of the new cars that come out.\u201d  And that\u2019s okay, because there\u2019s a vast market for used cars out there, and cars are being traded all the time.  Still, I think you\u2019re going to have a big impact in the market for cars if you decide you\u2019re going to buy up all the new cars.  I would think the same is true of Treasury issuance.  Sure, it\u2019s a vast market, but a lot of those decisions have been made\u2014they all really want to hold these securities at their current values, and they\u2019re not in the market, really, at all, at current prices", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Last spring this Committee was hardly optimistic about the pace of recovery.  The central tendency of our April projections, for example, showed a persistent failure to achieve anything close to our dual mandate.  The anticipated shortfalls vis-\u00e0-vis our employment and inflation objectives both widened in the June projections.  Unfortunately, the disappointing news this summer\u2014lackluster employment, deteriorating sentiment, anemic retail sales, decelerating investment, and further price disinflation\u2014has pushed the attainment of our policy objectives off even further into the future.  The long slog we had been expecting in the spring now looks even longer and more painful. Furthermore, I think it\u2019s clear that a shortfall in aggregate demand is the main culprit behind this bleak outlook.  We\u2019re recovering from the worst global and economic financial meltdown since the Great Depression.  Households, businesses, and banks continue to struggle under debt burdens.  So the adverse headwinds holding back aggregate demand remain fierce. Of course, a negative shock to aggregate supply is also partly to blame, and we could improve our failing grade on our full employment mandate by grading on a curve, that is, by substantially raising the NAIRU.  President Kocherlakota noted last time that recent estimates of the Beveridge curve relating unemployment to job openings showed an outward shift relative to the 2000s, suggesting that the labor market is experiencing significant disruptions.  The outward shift seems undeniable, but I want to argue that, even so, it\u2019s inappropriate to gauge changes in the NAIRU from Beveridge curve shifts alone.  In the first place, the Beveridge curve is only one relationship involved in determining equilibrium unemployment.  Mathematically, after all, it\u2019s one equation and two variables, unemployment and vacancies.  Thus, you also need to understand the movement of vacancies to pin down where you are on the Beveridge curve.  Mostmodels of frictional unemployment implicitly or explicitly have a second upward-sloping job-creation relationship.  Then horizontal shifts in the Beveridge curve typically result in less than a one-for-one increase in the NAIRU.  Consistent with the theory, the Beveridge curve has empirically shifted in and out over history by far more than we think the NAIRU has moved.  Indeed, the outward shift in recent quarters is well within the historical range of previous business cycle recoveries. A second point to emphasize is that shifts in the Beveridge curve may result from either structural or transitory factors.  Structural shifts could reflect greater mismatch. But the curve would also be expected to shift out if the pace of layoffs rises, as it did when the economy entered a tailspin.  A shift in the Beveridge curve for this reason would likely prove transitory or cyclical. Ultimately, then, it\u2019s an empirical task to figure out how much of the recent movements in the Beveridge curve reflect cyclical factors related to the weak economy and weak aggregate demand and how much reflects more permanent changes affecting the NAIRU.  My staff has examined this issue using a variety of approaches.  These include analyzing data on vacancies and job-finding rates, asking all of our directors during the intermeeting period about their ability to find qualified workers, and estimating time-varying Phillips curve models.  Taking all of these analyses together, we arrive at a medium-term NAIRU of 5.75 percent, identical to the Tealbook.  My staff also estimates that the extended unemployment insurance programs add about three-quarters of a percentage point more, bringing the current effective NAIRU to about 6.5 percent.  Thus, our best estimate is that there is about 3 percentage points of excess unemployment, considerably more than at this stage of the recoveries in 1975 and 1983, for example. Furthermore, over the next few years, as extended UI programs expire and mismatch is reduced, the NAIRU falls.  So there will be considerable slack remaining for years. My contacts confirm the conclusion that mismatch is a problem only for small, specialized jobs, and, without exception, they report that it is now easier to identify applicants for such specialized skilled jobs than before the recession.  If anything, they see an abundance of qualified workers, not a shortage.  As one contact put it, \u201cSure, we see mismatch.  We see many more applicants now who are overqualified relative to job requirements.\u201d  Indeed, with an abundance of qualified applicants and a lack of sales, firms may well see some option value in holding vacancies open longer as they search for the really exceptional candidate. Of course, this considerable resource slack is also holding down wages and prices.  My contacts expect to raise nominal wages modestly, at best, and they don\u2019t think they can raise their prices much, if at all.  Recently, they seem increasingly worried about deflation, not about high inflation.  I tried to reassure my contacts that deflation is unlikely.  That said, I\u2019m not reassured by the Tealbook\u2019s inflation confidence intervals, which imply as much as one chance in three that core inflation will be less than 0.5 percent in 2012, and work by my staff, which finds that yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries price in about one chance in six that cumulative CPI inflation over the next three years will be negative.  No matter how you look at it, the probability distribution of future inflation outcomes is too low.  In sum, there is enormous resource slack, which I expect will persist for years, and inflation is running below desired levels", "  MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The trends in banking continue along the same lines that I\u2019ve reported before:  delinquencies, nonperformers, and charge-offs remain elevated but, with the exception of commercial real estate, are improving.  Within commercial real estate, construction and land development loans continue to deteriorate as borrowers run out of cash or simply give up.  Loans for income-producing commercial properties and owner-occupied properties seem to be bumping along a rocky bottom, but losses are still growing.All banks are actively seeking loans, but their efforts are directed primarily at taking market share from other banks rather than adjusting standards to widen the pool of prospective borrowers.  Interestingly, the large banks say that they\u2019re taking market share from the smaller banks because weakened condition doesn\u2019t allow them to keep lending.  The small banks say they\u2019re taking market share from the large banks with pullback from products or geographies.  Uncertainty is high among bankers, their regulators, and their customers.  So everyone is willing to make decisions based only on what they can see. Regulators classify loans that don\u2019t have a documented repayment source.  Loans are downgraded in response to potential trouble, but upgraded only after demonstrated performance improvement.  Bankers, in response, are making loans only when they are supported by current cash flow or collateral.  This makes loans for expansion or to cover cash flow shortfalls hard to get, and borrowers are only willing to hire or expand to meet sales that they can see.  I heard the same stories others heard about uncertainty about the economy, taxes, regulation, and health care costs, but I agree with President Evans that they could get over all these concerns if sales were just strong enough. It is true the consumers are steadily deleveraging, but a fair amount of the deleveraging is involuntary rather than voluntary.  Signs of voluntary deleveraging show up in higher payment rates on credit cards and a high volume of mortgage refinancing that involves a reduction in the term or the principal balance.  One banker reported that, for the first time in his experience, cash-in refinances were more prevalent than cash-out refinances.  Involuntary deleveraging can be found in charge-offs, foreclosures, repossessions, higher bankruptcies, and continued credit-line reductions.The rate of decline in overall bank lending is slowing as C&I lending and nonrevolving consumer credit balances stabilize.  While overall commercial real estate loans continue to contract, the 2.3 percent annualized decline in the nonfarm, nonresidential category for the second quarter in 2010 is actually the first noticeable decline in loans on existing properties.  All of the decline so far has come in construction and land development, with residential construction falling at an annual rate of 60 percent in the second quarter, following declines at an annual rate of 40 percent in the first quarter and 37 percent for all of 2009.  Similarly, commercial construction loans fell at 23 to 26 percent rates in 2010 after falling 17 percent in 2009, which leads me to my own area of uncertainty, namely, the forecast for residential construction. Despite all efforts to mitigate foreclosure, there are still five million mortgages more than 90 days past due, significantly more than the four million single-family units currently listed for sale.  There are an estimated 11 million underwater borrowers, and about a million more vacant houses than the 2000\u20132007 average.  At the same time, mortgage servicers report that acceptance rates for modification short sales and even principal reductions have plummeted and attendance at modification events has fallen off sharply.  The foreclosure process has become so protracted that it\u2019s hard to judge what any level of foreclosures actually means, but it seems reasonable to project that involuntary dispossessions in bank sales of property are likely to climb through the fall and into most of 2011. With construction lending falling sharply, increases in existing-home inventory on the horizon, and the price declines that would likely result from higher levels of distress sales, it seems perfectly plausible to me that residential investment pickup could be postponed well into 2012 or beyond.  I\u2019ve noticed that a number of the staff\u2019s write-downs to the forecast over thepast year have come from pushing out the recovery in housing starts.  So if residential investment doesn\u2019t materialize in 2011, it looks to me as if that would wipe out much of the projected improvement in GDP.  Housing may be a smaller part of the overall economy, but it\u2019s still a substantial part of the improvement in our forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic case for one of the A alternatives is compelling.  We are far below maximum sustainable employment, and inflation is too low.  Not only are we failing on both of our legislated mandates now, but, given current projections, we will continue to fail on both goals for far too long.  I don\u2019t believe that we are following an optimal policy, and I think this dire situation requires us to act.  But we do face a difficult challenge in communicating what we\u2019re doing and why, and we do need to prepare the ground.  So at this meeting I support alternative B.  It acknowledges the reality that the outlook for employment and inflation is unacceptable, and that the situation has on balance gotten worse.  It sets the stage for future action unless the situation improves markedly. Why should we take action now if we did not earlier in the year.  As you laid out clearly in your Jackson Hole speech, Mr. Chairman, further action has both benefits and costs.  Since the spring, the benefits have gone up as the outlook has deteriorated substantially.  But, even more importantly, the costs of acting have come down.  When we were expanding our purchases of longer-term assets last year and early this year, there were some fears that the unprecedented expansion of our balance sheet might have inflationary consequences or that inflation expectations might come unhinged.  Markets have now digested the notion that the FederalReserve can expand its balance sheet without dire inflationary consequences.  Indeed, by most measures, inflation expectations are lower today than they were in the spring:  Surveys of inflation expectations are lower, and inflation compensation from TIPS is lower; even the number of searches on Google for the term \u201cinflation\u201d has been trending down for months.  [Laughter]  \u201cDeflation\u201d is also headed up.  We\u2019ve also done a lot of important work in preparing and communicating our eventual exit strategy.  So the case for A is clear:  We\u2019re failing in our mandates, and we have the tools to do better. It is not that monetary policy is the main problem facing businesses, as many of you have pointed out.  But I do think policy can contribute to the solution, even if it isn\u2019t a panacea for what ails businesses these days.  And I think that, in addition to lowering the term premium and longer-term rates, it is important that there are channels working through, perhaps, a lower dollar and higher equity prices. In terms of the various A alternatives, there are a number of choices to make.  In principle, I understand the advantages of the second option for A2, paragraph 5, where we use asset purchases as an additional lever that we can move up or down.  And I would support this approach if I thought that a $500 billion initial purchase would put us at neutral, that is, a position where the odds were similar that our next move would be to ease or to tighten.  However, I think that we will still be behind the curve with a $500 billion injection, so that purchases beyond that are more likely than sales.  That makes me uncomfortable with the alternative language in paragraph 5 of A2.  We might not accomplish much on longer-term rates, because our message would be that we might buy $500 billion, but we will reassess at the next meeting and might end up buying less.  Such a message could add uncertainty to financial markets and gain us little on the term premium.  I\u2019m attracted by the reaction function approach,but it makes more sense to me to wait to introduce it until we have a truly symmetric bias on our desired LSAP stock. On paragraph 2 of the A options, I prefer A1, where we\u2019re explicit about our numerical objective.  Because it is more explicit, it should be more effective at anchoring inflation expectations.  The value of anchoring expectations to keep them from going too low outweighs the usual concerns that we\u2019re putting too much quantitative emphasis on just the inflation half of our dual mandate. Regarding President Evans\u2019 proposal for a state-contingent price level target, I support its goal of increasing inflation and inflation expectations to a level more consistent with our mandate.  I also support its willingness to entertain aggressive policies to escape the constraints of the zero bound.  However, it seems to me to be a challenging policy to communicate.  In addition, I am concerned that the policy might not work as the theory says it should if the policy is not communicated extremely clearly and if agents in the economy form expectations in a way that is not perfectly rational or forward-looking.  One concern I have in particular is that an announced increase in our medium-term inflation objective to, say, 3 percent would raise nominal mortgage rates, which do matter for liquidity-constrained homebuyers, and, thereby, would undermine any rejuvenation in the moribund housing market.  However, I am certainly open to further analysis and study of this option. On balance, then, my preference would be for alternative A1, where we commit to pursuing the dual mandate aggressively, where we state a numerical inflation objective, and where we pursue policies that signal the strength of our resolve.  And I think they can achieve some of the same benefits as a price level target with fewer potential costs", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m basically willing to support alternative B with some minor changes.  I think that paragraph 4 in B seems to suggest strongly that we will provide more accommodation in the next meeting.  I think we should try to weaken it slightly to indicate that we might not be willing to act.  So, instead of saying \u201cis prepared to provide additional accommodation as needed,\u201d I would prefer to say something like \u201cbe prepared to act as needed to support the economic recovery.\u201d  But I view that as something of a minor issue. Why not A.  I have problems with A, and it\u2019s not that I doubt that the unemployment rate is above its current dual mandate level.  I would put that figure closer to 8 percent than 7 or 6\u00be, but it\u2019s certainly below 9.6 percent.  My concern with A is credibility.  What will the American people think if they hear we\u2019re doing A.  Are they going to expect this move to lead the unemployment rate to fall by 1 or 2 percentage points over the next two years.  Do they think of this as being the main governmental response to the unemployment problem in the United States.  The estimate that Bill mentioned, the FRB/US estimate of the macroeconomic impact of the purchases in alternative A1 and A2, is a fall of 0.2 percentage point of unemployment over the next two years and an increase of 0.1 percentage point in inflation over that same period.  I think we should be clear about what we are hoping to gain by doing A if we go down that path; I have a footnote to that effect in our statement that says, \u201cOur best available economic models estimate that our purchase will generate an additional fall in the unemployment rate ofapproximately 0.2 percentage point over the next two years and an increase in the inflation rate of approximately 0.1 percentage point over that same period, if all else remains constant.\u201d  We could say \u201cceteris paribus,\u201d if we wanted to be geeky. And I would go on to say that future purchases of a similar magnitude are likely to have smaller effects, but that\u2019s just an option.  But I think we should be clear about what we\u2019re actually hoping to achieve by doing this. We should do whatever is possible to meet our dual mandate.  Here I disagree a little bit with President Lacker in that I don\u2019t think we get to make up our mandate\u2014I think that it\u2019s the Congress\u2019s role to tell us what to do.   But we should be clear about what we view as our limitations in meeting that mandate.  Without that clarity, I think we can only be exposed to a loss of institutional credibility. Now, as some others around the table said, I\u2019m worried about the possibility of ongoing disinflation.  For me that concern is especially over the next year or 18 months, and I\u2019m concerned that simply announcing that we don\u2019t want to have disinflation, saying that we\u2019d like to have prices go up, may not be enough to accomplish that goal.  I\u2019m concerned, in other words, not about what price level we want to achieve, but rather about the policy instruments that we have available to achieve what we want to.  In your Jackson Hole speech, Mr. Chairman, you spelled out three possible tools:  lowering the interest rate on excess reserves, offering stronger forward guidance, and purchasing more Treasuries.  I think the first two approaches have their problems.  They don\u2019t seem to be on the table at this stage anyway, but they could generate this deflationary steady state of the kind that President Bullard\u2019s article, \u201cSeven Faces of \u2018The Peril\u2019\u201d describes.  So I think the option that\u2019s on the table to try to confront disinflation is buying more Treasuries.In terms of the staff estimates of the effects that Bill discussed, as far as I understand them, they\u2019re based on taking this portfolio-balance effect that\u2019s been estimated in earlier work and putting it in the FRB/US model.  If we bought $2 trillion of Treasuries, it would generate\u2014and this is assuming total linearity in the response, which I think is far too extreme\u201440 basis points in inflation.  I don\u2019t view this as a strong dam against significant disinflationary pressures.  The usual intuition is that having banks hold more reserves\u2014that is, if we put more stuff on the balance sheet\u2014it will put upward pressure on the price level and inflation expectations.  But this intuition is all about scarcity\u2014that reserves are scarce and their associated liquidity advantages are scarce.  Instead, banks are currently holding $1 trillion dollars of excess reserves\u2014reserves are not scarce.  I would say that if you look at the staff\u2019s balance sheet forecast, they don\u2019t see reserves as being scarce until sometime in 2018.  So trying to play off the scarcity of reserves is going to be a very subtle device to work with.  I don\u2019t see these three tools as being highly effective ways to combat significant disinflation.  What should we do instead.  President Evans talked about the Spanish Inquisition.  Here it comes", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  The problem with open market operations is that they require the Fed to give up reserves for assets of equal value, given the current price level.  These kinds of exchanges put no pressure on the price level when the system is awash in excess reserves.  What we need to do is give up the dollars for nothing, to do what Milton Friedman described as a helicopter drop of currency.  As the Chairman noted in his famous 2002 speech, this kind of handout of nominal wealth has the potential to generate upward pressure on the price level. In my view we need to do some \u201cblue sky\u201d thinking about how the FOMC can best approximate a helicopter drop.  At the Minneapolis Fed, my research and legal staff have beencombing through the Federal Reserve Act and through a great 2004 working paper by David Small and Jim Clouse in order to figure out how to do so.  The outcome of that analysis is that the Federal Reserve Act does provide ways for the Fed to approximate a helicopter drop.  For example, Section 10(b) puts few strictures on the quality of collateral that is needed to back advances made at depository institutions for the discount window.  By making nonrecourse advances or advances backed by risky collateral, the Fed can implicitly inject\u2014actually, explicitly inject\u2014nominal wealth into the economy.  And by specifying particular kinds of collateral, such as residential mortgages or small business loans, the Fed could potentially stimulate particular kinds of real activity. This sounds radical\u2014let\u2019s get more radical.  Section 14(b) allows the FOMC to purchase some kinds of state and local government obligations.  These purchases need not be in an open market.  By exploiting this option, the FOMC could pay face value for state and local government obligations which, in fact, have credit risk.  People talk about monetization of Treasury debt.  This is talking about monetization\u2014serious monetization\u2014of state and local government debt.  This, again, could stimulate inflation and, possibly, real activity. These ideas are still sketchy.  We need a great deal of staff work to figure out their legal and economic ramifications, and they come, obviously, with significant amounts of medium-term and longer-term institutional risk.  I will stress that I myself might end up opposing them [laughter] once I see the initial staff work.  But I would emphasize that, given the risk of disinflation that we face and given that the tools we have at our disposal do not overwhelm us by their potential, we have to be willing to explore all of these.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I did actually think about the LTROs, the long-term refinancing operations that the Europeans used.  They basically give longer-term loans atlow interest rates to banks.  That approach isn\u2019t very popular.  But, in principle, you could restrict the kind of collateral you\u2019ll accept\u2014to do credit, for example.  There are practical problems with that.  And I\u2019m sure a few of our colleagues would worry about credit applications, so I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d want to jump right into that.  But let me just say, in general, that we should think about whether there are other tools besides purchases of assets.  We\u2019re up to President Hoenig", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I must tell you that I do agree with you on one thing.  [Laughter]  I think we should have a discussion around regime change, if we\u2019re moving that way.  Alternative B strikes me as moving towards a new regime, and some of the other discussions seemed to take that direction, and I think it would be healthy to have a conversation before we get too far.  I\u2019ll come back to that in just a second. In listening to this discussion, it reminds me that we are a central planning organization, for monetary policy. We come here; we discuss monetary policy for the nation.  And one of my fears is that, as a central planner, we think we can do more than we can.  That really bothers me. I know people don\u2019t all agree with this, but, again, I think the crisis we\u2019ve just suffered was not caused by high interest rates or accelerating interest rates, but by an extended period of exceptionally low interest rates when unemployment was 6.5 percent and we were afraid it was too high. I think we have to be modest about what we can do.  I am not arguing for high interest rates at all\u2014I never have been.  I am arguing for getting off of zero, getting away from thinking that if we only added another trillion dollars of high-powered money, everything would be okay.  It won\u2019t.  There are other things going on in this economy that have to adjust, are adjusting, and we want to mitigate the consequences of that, but we can\u2019t solve all of those problems.  For thatreason, as I\u2019ve said in other meetings, I judge that it is not appropriate to indicate that the economic and financial conditions warrant basically a zero interest rate and to guarantee that the fed funds rate will be zero for an extended period of time.  I think the \u201cextended period\u201d language tells the market and businesses that after a year of recovery, it is not sustainable.  I think we\u2019re telling them that, and they\u2019re acting accordingly. Also, there\u2019s the issue of a commitment to zero rates over time.  Zero rates, like any rates, are allocative mechanisms, and they lead to future imbalances and increases in the risks for our long-term macroeconomic and financial stability.  That\u2019s part of our mandate\u2014longer-run performance, not just performance today.  We need to put bounds around ourselves, so that we don\u2019t give in to that temptation to think that if we only do more, everything will be okay.  The economy is continuing to recover modestly, as most of us anticipated from the beginning.  Maybe it\u2019s more modest than we would like, but, still, it\u2019s recovering systematically. I believe that we should take a longer-run perspective and allow our balance sheet to decline gradually as mortgage-backed securities are redeemed rather than continuing to make Treasury purchases to keep the size of our asset holdings constant and encourage banks and others to take on the risk of longer-term instruments.  Banks are extending their maturities now, because we\u2019ve given them this guarantee of lower rates for an extended period.  There are going to be consequences from that.   Of the statements and the alternatives offered, again, I prefer C.   But, even in this instance, I prefer it only as long as it is interpreted, as Bill said, as signaling that we would soon end our investment in maturing mortgage-backed assets.  Otherwise I find the statement not acceptable.  I realize the implications of that for the markets, and, therefore, I would start withjust removing the \u201cextended period\u201d language\u2014nothing else\u2014because I think it would signal that we\u2019re more confident in the economy, and I think that would be helpful. I object to alternative B not only because it continues our commitment to zero rates, but also because it, in effect, eases policy further by heightening the expectation of additional asset purchases in November.  It just signals to the market that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, and, therefore, it will react accordingly.  I would be especially concerned with a policy statement like alternative A1 that elevates our inflation goal and could be seen as establishing the Federal Reserve as an inflation targeter when we\u2019ve really not discussed that adequately.  At this point, the crisis should have taught us that we need to increase our emphasis on longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability and not just on inflation goals.  We have allocative effects, and I think we should be very, very mindful of that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have come around to the opinion that further purchases of Treasury securities are warranted.  I\u2019m concerned that a delay in the recovery of the housing market beyond what\u2019s assumed in the Tealbook is possible and, perhaps, likely.  And while I\u2019m quite skeptical that lower longer-term rates will have a significant effect on overall borrowing, lower rates are the key to success for modifications and restructures of residential and commercial mortgages.  So, to the extent that lower rates result in faster, stronger credit recovery, they could on the margins contribute to easier credit terms.  But beyond that, I went back to the transcript from the last meeting and was persuaded by two arguments made then:  first, that missing both parts of our dual mandate on the same side was hard to defend; second, that the possibility of its not working was not a reason not to try.  So, on those points, I concede. Where I don\u2019t concede is on our need to communicate clearly what we\u2019re doing if we\u2019re establishing a new regime with implied thresholds, reaction functions, and limits.  I would beprepared to vote for alternative A1 or A2 today if I had some idea of the framework we were establishing.  But if it\u2019s not clear inside this room, I don\u2019t see any possibility that it will be clear outside this room.  We seem to have ruled out going all-in at once, the \u201cshock and awe\u201d alternative, but in alternative A we are still expressing ourselves in the same way:  purchase of X dollars in Y time frame.  If we need to adjust this, will we adjust the amount, or will we adjust the time frame.  And what will be the trigger for adjustment.  If the action doesn\u2019t have much impact and the forecast remains the same, will we add more.  If it does start to work and the outlook improves for some other reason, will we pull back or will we stop.  Or are we prepared to use both purchases and sales and target our balance sheet, as President Bullard suggests.  And where does the $500 billion in alternative A come from, anyway.  If our decision at the last meeting was roughly equivalent to $400 billion by year-end 2011, how do those two compare.  And do we have too many regimes going on all at once.  Would it make sense to combine all Treasury purchases into one action and say something like, \u201cWe will purchase Treasury securities in amounts necessary to replace all maturities and principal repayments, plus $100 billion per month\u201d. So I favor alternative B.  I\u2019m fully prepared to take action at our next meeting if conditions remain the same or deteriorate, as long as I understand the strategy we\u2019re following.  I hope that we can once again ask staff to do the heavy lifting of further developing a memo defining the alternative approaches and the methods of communicating them so we can use the two-day meeting to agree on a regime, if not on the precise thresholds.  I understand the concern about losing the effects of additional purchases in the intermeeting period, but I, frankly, believe that the accommodation language in paragraph 4, combined with the clarity of our views about inflation in paragraph 2, will do as much good as the $100 billion or so in securities we mightbuy between now and the November meeting.  The November meeting has the additional benefit of our published projections, which should tamp down the impression that some had after our last meeting that we knew something bad about the economy that no one else did.  In fact, I would suggest that, in addition to announcing a new regime, we consider releasing our projections with the statement rather than waiting for the publication of the minutes. Finally, it\u2019s my hope that we can come out of the November meeting with a common understanding of the regime we are using and a strong communication of that regime.  We might still disagree over the action, but it will be clear to me, at least, what it is that we disagree about.  It\u2019s all well and good to have these geeky conversations as we debate policy, and, in fact, at this end of the table, the three geeks who are here have demonstrated that there is no dearth of ideas.  But if our ultimate goal is to effect the day-to-day decisions of non-geeks and folks like me, then we must be able to explain it. President Lacker suggested that our actions in August damaged confidence.  I believe that it was not our actions, but, as I feared at the time, it was the bobbling of the communication that actually damaged confidence.  If we are going to get the full potential confidence benefit of a regime change outside of the mechanics of what we do, I would suggest that we consider releasing an additional or expanded statement explaining our new regime, along the lines of the one that President Evans suggested in his memo.  I\u2019m not sure that I necessarily prefer his approach, but I\u2019m pleased to report that I could understand it in my own non-geeky way. Finally, in addition to a statement of regime in our projections, I would suggest that the Chairman find a way to take questions either on or off the record.  In this environment, I think we\u2019re much better served by having the Chairman and our statements answer the questions thanto have our views, objectives, and disagreements channeled through speculation by reporters and media commentators.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, just to take things sort of backwards, first, I\u2019m encouraged by the desire at this table to discuss a regime change.  I think it\u2019s timely.  It might be significantly effective.  Some proposals have been put on the table.  I read very carefully President Evans\u2019 paper on price level targeting, although to my knowledge, other than Sweden in 1930, it has never been successfully employed, but I think it is worth discussing.  My own staff seems eager to put together a paper on the possibility of targeting nominal income or nominalspending.  I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m convinced that that\u2019s the right approach, but we would be happy to add to the discussion. I think it\u2019s necessary because these statements that we\u2019re providing are becoming more and more convoluted and, I think, run the risk of painting us into a corner or of further confusing the market.  So I\u2019m all in favor of your very thoughtful recommendation, and I like Governor Tarullo\u2019s suggestion that we may not do this only at meetings, but that we may have some interim stages where we develop this further so that we can do it efficiently. I want to go back very quickly to the implied debate we had earlier in the go-round about final demand and whether or not government regulations and random refereeing are inhibiting investment.  One factor that is clearly not inhibiting businesses is access to liquidity or the cost of money.  The other thing that is clear is that you can\u2019t have final demand unless you have consumption, and in a period of high unemployment, you can\u2019t have consumption unless you have job creation.  So I think our objectives are all the same on that front, and I don\u2019t find much distinction among them. I am concerned that, as we pursue the business of, in essence, subsidizing risk\u2014trying to lower the premiums by providing accommodation\u2014in the globalized community, we may be, in fact, subsidizing job creation elsewhere rather than here in the United States.  That\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing from those who hire and those who are utilizing their resources in terms of finding an ROI elsewhere that is superior, not available in the United States.  It\u2019s not clear to me that further accommodation is going to change that equation.  I just wanted to put those points on the table. With regard to the statements, I find myself lining up, not surprisingly, with President Lacker and President Plosser.  I thought that Governor Warsh made a very good suggestion.  But I want to go back to a point that President Lacker made, which is very important, and also pickup on the statement Governor Duke made.  Governor Duke said if it\u2019s not clear inside this room, it won\u2019t be clear outside this room.  President Lacker correctly pointed out we have not discussed what the inflation levels that we agree to at this table in three years.  I\u2019m very uncomfortable with the sentences in paragraph 2 in alternative B where we refer to levels twice even though we do not have agreement internally as to what they might be.  We talk about 1 to 2 percent, around 1\u00bd, 1.7 to 2 percent.  We have never had a thorough discussion of that, and I believe we should.  I would be uncomfortable with alternative B if we were to reference those levels that the Committee considers consistent with its mandate.  If we haven\u2019t agreed to it internally, I don\u2019t know how we can convince people externally as to what they might be. I would suggest especially dropping it in paragraph 4.  If we were to go in the direction of alternative B, I would suggest we take into consideration Governor Warsh\u2019s point of substituting \u201cif\u201d for the word \u201cas,\u201d and I would drop the rest of the sentence and include President Kocherlakota\u2019s editorial suggestion.  Actually, my preference would be just to issue a one-sentence statement if you want to set up your regime change.  \u201cThe Committee met and decided not to change the policy articulated at the last meeting.\u201d  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I can go one better.  We used not to issue any statement at all", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I believe we should provide additional monetary policy accommodation.  The economy is too weak, inflation is too low, and we are too far away from our full employment objective.  But I believe that there are several competing options for action on the table that are open to us, and we haven\u2019t reached consensuson them.  I also think each option does have some risks associated with it, so I agree that we do need more time, especially for the staff to do the necessary work, for us to reach a consensus, and for us to prepare market participants for what we are ultimately going to do.  I support alternative B at this meeting, and, unless the economy improves markedly soon, I would expect to prefer a statement like alternative A at the November FOMC meeting. With any policy move there are both costs and benefits, and the Chairman made that clear very nicely, I thought, in his speech at Jackson Hole.  In this regard, there are several things we can do to reduce the cost of further monetary policy accommodation.  First, I think one of the most important ones is that we can be a lot more disciplined in terms of how we communicate to markets.  I was very unhappy about the press stories that came out after the last FOMC meeting, because some of the stories delved all too accurately into the specifics of the meeting\u2014who said what and what the staff briefings were\u2014and I think that is completely privileged information.  It\u2019s completely inappropriate for any of that to be disclosed to market participants.  If it\u2019s going to be disclosed, that should only happen in the minutes, after all of us have had a chance to comment on the draft\u2014that\u2019s the way that should get out.  I think it\u2019s noteworthy in that regard that in our survey of primary dealers we got the lowest grade in terms of the quality of our communications since we began asking the dealers that question in early 2009, and I think that was in spite of the Chairman\u2019s efforts.  At Jackson Hole I think he gave a very good, clear speech that was on target, and despite that we got a very low grade.  So I think the leaks very much hurt us in that regard. Second, I think we can do a better job in providing more clarity to market participants about the framework we\u2019re using to shape policy.  People around the table laid out a number of choices.  We can keep the current framework, continue to emphasize our dual mandate, andexplain a little bit better how further disinflation is inconsistent with achieving full employment. We also can shift the framework a bit, if we decide that that adjustment would make it easier for us to achieve our dual mandate.  The only reason to shift it is if we think that\u2019s going to make it more likely that we\u2019re going to accomplish our objective.  In this regard, I would strongly encourage the staff to investigate a lot of the things that have been raised today, such as moving to an explicit inflation targeting regime per alternative A1 or using the price-level regime that President Evans laid out.  My own opinion is that exploring a price-level target regime is worthwhile, because such a regime does have advantages relative to an inflation targeting regime.  It\u2019s more powerful in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, because shortfalls in inflation have to be made up in future periods.  It also may have a potential advantage in terms of credibility, because by introducing it you\u2019re admitting the prospect that you will miss your inflation objective over the short run, while having an inflation target and then missing it does have potential risks for credibility.  On the disadvantage side for price-level targets, as President Yellen laid out, they\u2019re a lot more complicated, there are a lot more moving parts, a lot of communication challenges.  The devil is in the details on this one.  So I\u2019d like the staff to work on the details so we can see how big a devil it is. Third, I think we can do more to reduce the risk that market participants will be unsettled by further balance sheet expansion.  That means we need to explain more clearly how it would work.  For example, if we decide to do it on a continuous basis, what does that mean.  What are the units of change that we might like to use.  That is, we don\u2019t move the funds rate 7 basis points, and then 12 basis points, then 18 basis points\u2014we move in increments of 25 basis points.  So presumably there has to be some sort of analogue to that in terms of how we adjust the balance sheet.  I think that doing all of these things, so that market participants understand whywe\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing and how the process will unfold over the longer term\u2014not just between this meeting and next meeting\u2014should help improve the probability that inflation expectations will be well anchored and that policy will achieve the desired results. Regarding the language for today\u2019s statement, I think the key issue is:  What are we trying to shoot for in terms of what the markets think about what\u2019s going to happen in November.  I\u2019m sure everyone around the table has a different view of what they\u2019re shooting for.  In my own opinion, I want to have the markets view us as likely to move at the next meeting if we don\u2019t get an acceleration, a meaningful improvement, in economic activity.  So I want language that is consistent with that.  If, after this meeting, the market thought there was a 60 percent probability that we were going to move at the next meeting, I think that would be about right.  I don\u2019t want it to be much higher than that, because I don\u2019t want it to be a foregone conclusion, where we\u2019re sort of locked in.  But I don\u2019t want it to be much lower than that.  I think it\u2019s really important to remember that policy isn\u2019t symmetric now\u2014being late is far worse than being early.  I don\u2019t want us to get in a position where we just temporize from meeting to meeting, saying that things are a little stronger, so we can wait another meeting.  Then we\u2019d get further and further behind, and, if a shock arose, we\u2019d actually have a deflation problem.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, everyone, for your input.  This is very, very difficult.  We don\u2019t have good options.  It feels safer not to do anything, but then, on the other side, we have an economy which is underperforming very severely\u2014we have very high unemployment.  So there\u2019s no safe option.  Whatever we do, we\u2019re going to have to make our best judgment and hope for the best.I certainly appreciate the comments that President Hoenig and Governor Warsh and others have made about the risks and uncertainties associated with these monetary policies that we\u2019re using.  At the same time, as I said, I\u2019m concerned about the state of the economy, and I don\u2019t think that these policies are necessarily marginal in their impact.  There\u2019s more to the effects than just the portfolio-balance effects, for example.  Inflation expectation effects, for example, could be very powerful if they took us back up to, say, 2 percent.  I do think we should be moving in this direction, and I\u2019m glad to hear that there\u2019s broad support for trying to develop a framework that will give more certainty and more clarity to the public about what we\u2019re doing.  With respect to that, I\u2019m certainly open to a longer meeting next time, and I also was going to suggest the possibility of a video meeting sometime in between, if the staff were ready to go over some preliminary discussion points\u2014we certainly can consider that. I have one final comment on the substance.  I just disagree with the view that we should not do anything until deflation is upon us.  First of all, zero is only a number.  Low inflation is also costly, because it creates low inflation expectations, higher real interest rates, higher debt burdens, and has, therefore, negative effects on the real economy as well as being not at the level of inflation that I think most of us consider consistent with our mandate.  Moreover, of course, these things have a lot of momentum, and, if you wait too long, then you may find yourself seriously behind the curve.  So I feel comfortable with moving in this direction.  I think, broadly speaking, it\u2019s the right direction. Sorry, I have a couple of additional things.  There were a lot of interesting specific points on the framework, and I think the main thing is that we need to keep working at it.  President Bullard suggested we undertake a few things today.  I understand his point, but I take his comments as being input to the discussion we need to have during the intermeeting period and atthe next meeting.  Some of the issues were about whether or not the appropriate measure is the flow of new purchases or the stock size of the balance sheet; I think those are good questions that we need to think through. The statement is also a little risky, because it changes quite a bit.  The reaction to our last statement wasn\u2019t very good.  I, obviously, have to take some responsibility for that.  I think partly it was bad luck, but partly it was that we didn\u2019t convey exactly the appropriate tone in terms of our outlook for the economy.  I think a risk in this statement is that, by talking about inflation below our preferred levels, we may convey a greater fear of deflation than we want.  I thought about a very small change in paragraph B2 where it says \u201cMeasures of underlying inflation have declined.\u201d Maybe we could change that to \u201chave come down over time\u201d\u2014something like that that\u2019s a bit less dramatic.  \u201cDecline\u201d sounds as if it happened since the last meeting.  So it would read, \u201cMeasures of underlying inflation have come down over time and are currently at levels\u2026\u201d  My hope, therefore, is to mitigate that risk.  As we communicate, we should be clear that we are looking at an inflation level that is not yet deflation, of course, and that we don\u2019t necessarily anticipate it to be deflation, but, nevertheless, it is too low for the best performance that we can achieve. By the way, on this issue of what rate the Committee judges to be appropriate, I realize that we haven\u2019t discussed it for a few years, but this Committee has discussed these issues three or four times in the last decade, I think, and the conclusions have been pretty much the same in each case:  PCE inflation is the right measure, and the level is something around 2 percent, or a little less than 2 percent.  Certainly this is something we want to clarify at the next meeting if we decide to go in this direction.  But it\u2019s also true that the current inflation rates are below virtuallyeverybody\u2019s estimate of what the appropriate longer-run inflation rate is in your projections, so I don\u2019t think we are going, really, too far from what\u2019s appropriate. Finally, I heard the comments on the last paragraph, B4.  It\u2019s a very delicate calculation.  Like the Vice Chairman, I\u2019d like to be sure to leave some optionality.  Since we circulated the first version of this a week ago, we have tried to tone it down twice.  The Tealbook was substantially moderated, and then we made changes yesterday that were intended to make the future action less certain.  I guess I\u2019m open to a groundswell, but my recommendation would be to stay with the language we currently have.  Vice Chairman", " MR. ENGLISH.   My sense would be that just changing the paragraph will get people\u2019s attention, for sure.  They will notice, and they will assume that the thought is that further easing is going to be more likely.  You suggested 60 percent.  I think it could be higher\u2014I was guessing two-thirds.  I think last night as I was messing around with stuff in preparation for my briefing, some number like that came up\u2014probably less than 80 percent but more than 60 percent, I would guess", " MR. FISHER.  I don\u2019t want to be too much of a squeaky wheel here, but I notice that paragraph 2 focuses on it twice.  First we\u2019re saying it\u2019s below that which we judge consistent with our longer-run mandate, and, second, we say \u201cbefore rising to levels the Committee considers consistent with its mandate,\u201d even though I don\u2019t believe we have agreed on the levels; but, ceding that, I think that probably says enough.  What bothers me is adding it at the end of that sentence in paragraph 4.  I think that may be overkill, because it is implicit that we\u2019re not satisfied.  But, by having it at the end of paragraph 4, I think it becomes a little bit too explicit.  After all, we are saying \u201cis prepared to provide additional accommodation.\u201d  I assume we\u2019re going to substitute the word \u201cif,\u201d which I would recommend, as Governor Warsh did: \u201cif needed to support economic recovery.\u201d  We\u2019ve already talked about inflation twice in paragraph 2.  And that\u2019s a change", "\u201d  MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, let me see if I can get a groundswell going for \u201cif.\u201d  I think it would help soften it a little bit.  I think estimates of the probabilities that we\u2019re going to take action at the next meeting with this statement are a little low.  I think they\u2019re going to go to 0.9 or 0.95 or something.  Maybe that\u2019s okay, but the Committee sounds a little more tentative than that\u2014I think President Dudley was about right, in that we\u2019re thinking two-thirds or something.   So I do think it\u2019s still a little too strong.  Maybe \u201cif\u201d would help mitigate it a little bit\u2014it probably doesn\u2019t make too much difference\u2014but I\u2019d support that"], "2010FOMC20101015confcall.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, applaud all the staff\u2019s work.  I think it was a great idea to work hard at this juncture to try to move towards some coherent change in the framework around our monetary policy actions. I\u2019m very sympathetic to the idea of a mandate-consistent inflation objective, and I think that putting the objective in the statement or in our communications, as in statement 2, could really help.  We were on the verge of adopting a numerical objective for inflation four and a half years ago.  Events intervened, so it would be great to find a good opportunity to get back to that and to cross the line to making it explicit.I\u2019m against a price-level target at this time.  I think it\u2019s sort of complicated.  I think it\u2019s hard to communicate, and it\u2019s hard to prevent secondary accounts that would boil our decision down to a statement of, \u201cWell, they want to increase inflation for a couple of years.\u201d  I think that\u2019s inevitably going to be the headline version of how a price-level target would be communicated.  Also, it would look sort of opportunistic, and it would convey a sense that we have a regime where we move our near-term inflation rate target around a lot, and I think that would be detrimental to our credibility. As for putting some numerical information about an unemployment rate in a public communication of ours, I strongly object.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, and I think it\u2019s dangerous for some of the reasons that Presidents Bullard and Kocherlakota have articulated.  I think that, even with the qualifications that you articulated this morning in your speech, Mr. Chairman, and that are in the statement, it would inevitably be viewed as a target equal in stature and importance to our inflation target but somewhat above the \u201cmoderate long-term interest rate\u201d objective that is part of our mandate as well.  I think that the language that\u2019s in the proposed statement about the unemployment rate is confusing and potentially highly misleading in very dangerous ways.  It describes it as \u201csustainable in the longer term.\u201d  When I think about \u201csustainable\u201d inflation rates\u2014that\u2019s where we use the term, after all\u2014I think of a longer-run average inflation rate.  Yet I don\u2019t think people think of this unemployment rate, 5 to 5\u00bc, as the longer-run average unemployment rate.  I think what you have in mind is full employment\u2014the language that was used in the 1963 Economic Report of the President.  From the data, it doesn\u2019t look as if it\u2019s going to be easy for us to sustain an unemployment rate of 5 percent\u2014the unemployment rate gets down there, but in recessions it goes up again.  It\u2019s also not clear to me that we need to talk about the unemployment rate in our statement.  Our mandate says \u201cmaximum employment\u201d after all.  A lot of other things go into the unemployment rate, as others have noted.Let me take a crack at articulating something I tried to convey at our last meeting.  This notion of a sustainable longer-run inflation rate seems to me to be motivated by the NAIRU idea; that is, the NAIRU is a latent variable to which the unemployment rate returns, and it\u2019s slow moving\u2014maybe it responds to demographic factors or productivity growth or the like, but it does so only over long time horizons and in a smooth and gradual way.  But I think it\u2019s important to recognize that this slow-moving characteristic is an assumption that\u2019s imposed on the model\u2014maybe there are some technological assumptions that lead to it\u2014and it\u2019s not verifiable or testable within that framework, because it\u2019s a latent variable. If you relax that assumption, as the New Keynesian Phillips curve models do\u2014the ones built on preferences, endowments, and technologies\u2014you find that this latent variable, the NAIRU, responds to all the shocks that affect business cycle fluctuations in output and inflation.  What\u2019s important to recognize is that there\u2019s a bunch of theory built into the way the NAIRU has been constructed, and it is theory that is very, very open to debate, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen enough by way of staff analysis of alternative approaches.  The approach built into this NAIRU idea is one that goes back to Samuelson and Solow and to the models that, I think, got us into trouble in the 1970s.  I thought the debate about this was sort of settled in the 1980s, so I\u2019m surprised that it lingers for so long in our thinking.  As I said, I think this is a somewhat dangerous and misleading idea, because it\u2019s going to lead people to believe that we need to reduce the unemployment rate rapidly to its longer-run sustainable rate.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be easy to communicate the sense that that\u2019s something that we don\u2019t expect to be able to get to for four or five years. Let me emphasize that, for me, this isn\u2019t a matter of not caring about unemployment.  I think unemployment is a problem.  But I\u2019m with President Bullard on this\u2014and I think it\u2019s the consensus in the field\u2014namely, that our best contribution is to keep inflation fluctuating around a level that\u2019slow and stable.  Inevitably, there\u2019s theorizing when you make the transition from economic models that allow you to evaluate the well-being of people to a reduced form, such as thinking of policy as pursuing an objective of low inflation and unemployment.  I\u2019m not against theorizing, and I\u2019m not against basing what we do on some theory.  But we ought to be explicit about it and put our cards on the table.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had enough time to do that, and I don\u2019t think the staff is focused on that step of the movement from maximizing welfare to the point where we say, \u201cAll right, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to operationalize the mandate Congress has given us.\u201d My preference would be to leave any numerical discussion of the unemployment rate to the SEP, as we do now.  I found myself drawn to the idea of an option that wasn\u2019t on the table\u2014you might call it 1.5\u2014where we\u2019re explicit about our inflation rate but not numerically explicit about the unemployment rate.  If being explicit about our inflation rate is something that needs to be held hostage to being explicit about the unemployment rate, then I\u2019m with President Kocherlakota and say that we just ought to defer that step for the time being and communicate about inflation as we do now.  After all, we\u2019re very, very close to having articulated the target rate as 2 percent or a little under that. On LSAPs, I agree with President Bullard", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me add my thanks to the staff for their excellent preparation of materials for the meeting.  In my comments, I\u2019m going to express, at a fairly high level, what I favor and am sympathetic to versus what I\u2019m skeptical about. At this point, I favor an explicit inflation objective.  I could see it as possibly a step in the direction of a price level objective, with which I have some sympathy, but, at this point, I think it\u2019s best to stay with an inflation objective.  I do think it\u2019s timely to introduce an inflation objective.  I believe it would shore up concerns about the growth of the balance sheet in the event that we doimplement new LSAP programs.  As I said, I am sympathetic to price-level targeting, but I think the public needs much more preparation to understand that and to be able to factor it into expectations. I am very concerned and very skeptical about quantitative guidance related to the unemployment rate.  As I think President Lacker said, I think this would be construed as a target, and one where we have little if any flexibility.  I\u2019m not clear how useful the concept of a longer-run unemployment rate is.  As regards communication, because I\u2019m skeptical about this, my skepticism also applies to draft statements 2 and 3.  Again, President Lacker said something that I had considered:  Although it wasn\u2019t in the staff\u2019s materials, I wonder if the statement could combine a quantitative inflation target with some fortified qualitative treatment of unemployment.  That might produce a satisfactory model for the statement. I do favor additional LSAPs at this time.  For my part, it would be preferable to do so with an inflation objective, but, if necessary, we could do so without.  I think LSAPs will have some positive effect through a variety of channels. I\u2019m skeptical at this stage about interest-rate targeting.  But if we go there, I would prefer a 10-year Treasury rate option.  I see that as almost a benchmark for the curve in the minds of market participants in many respects. Regarding the method of adjusting policy, I favor the smaller, more continuous approach.  I think we can do the same kind of thing with LSAP adjustments that we have done with the federal funds rate:  We can accustom the markets to small, discrete, incremental adjustments.  I do think it\u2019s important to introduce conditionality or state-contingency, which I think will help with communication.  We can manage the communication and the market reaction to some extent by assessing the program at each meeting and trying to communicate that assessment as clearly as possible.  I think we are best served by estimating the cumulative size of the LSAP, announcing thisas the size, and then treating this number as the most likely outcome, barring any clear evidence that conditions have changed enough to alter the stated direction. As regards communication issues, I don\u2019t have a lot of comments today.  As I said, I think it\u2019s important that we make clear the conditionality of an LSAP as well as the notion that it goes both ways.  I favor the idea of the Chairman conducting press conferences, particularly to explain any regime change that comes out of these meetings. I do want to bring up a question that I thought was close to being on the table a few months ago, which may seem in some respects a digression at this stage.  I think at that point we were at least beginning to entertain the idea of introducing some treatment of interest on reserves in our communication and in our statement.  I think at some stage in the future, during an exit period or even earlier, that might serve us.  I raise this issue because, if we\u2019re going to make substantial changes in how we communicate, or if we\u2019re going to try to socialize a new approach to monetary policy, this might be the time to introduce more treatment of interest on reserves.  Those are my thoughts at this stage.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  You said first that you liked it, but then you went on to\u2014 MS. DUKE.  I do like it, but I would like to work it into the SEP somehow rather than putting it in the statement", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to begin by underscoring something Bill Dudley said a few minutes ago, namely, that the most important thing about our structure for communication and for specifying objectives of monetary policy over the near to medium term is less about inflation targeting or price-level targeting and more about giving people a pretty clear indication of how we would make decisions subsequent to a further accommodative policy step. That actually was my initial thought\u2014just to agree with Bill\u2019s observation.  But having listened to many of you who preceded me, I\u2019m now almost affirmatively of the view that it would be a bad idea to try to specify some further objective for monetary policy in the near term.  It seems to me that significant disagreements have been voiced today and that an effort to resolve those disagreements may be more difficult than actually getting ourselves onto a path where people understand why we\u2019re making a large-scale asset purchase and what to expect about what we may do in the future.  Both Bill and Janet laid out potential paths that could be followed\u2014though they were somewhat different, either path would allow markets to project with fair assurance how they could anticipate our reactions to subsequent market or economic developments.  I will just state that I would be opposed to enunciating any inflation target while omitting any reference to the maximum employment mandate.  I have feared for some time\u2014a fear that has now been reinforced\u2014that there\u2019s a tendency to want to read the second part of the dual mandate out of the Federal Reserve Act, and I\u2019m unalterably opposed to that.  That feels to me the way some people are conceiving of an inflation target.  I thought Richard Fisher put the point very well, and, whether or not you agree with Richard\u2019s alternative, I think one has to be sensitive to his identification of the problem.  With respect to the second question, yes, I would favor additional LSAPs.  As a couple of people have said earlier, we do have some basis now for evaluating their efficacy.  Surely, LSAPsmight not be one of the measures that people would favor were they able to control all policy, fiscal and monetary.  But we can control only monetary policy, and we have to respond to whatever situation we find, using the tools available to us. I was inclined to say that I favor large, discrete adjustments made infrequently as opposed to smaller, more continuous adjustments made more often.  But I want to be very clear that I don\u2019t think \u201cshock and awe\u201d is on the table.  I don\u2019t think anybody is going to be shocked and awed by $500 billion, given talk and market expectations already.  I do think, for the reasons that a couple of people have stated so far, that there is merit in committing to a particular quantum, which, by my lights, would be larger rather than smaller, in order to have the maximum effect on markets.  If, as John said, stock effects have been shown to be the principal channel by which effects are transmitted to the market, then presumably you want to give as much certainty about the stock as you can at the outset. With respect to communication, I share in the broad agreement that having the Chairman communicate explicitly and reasonably quickly with the press after the FOMC meetings is a good idea.  I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m agnostic about the best form of this communication, but I don\u2019t think we need to decide that now.  I think Kevin identified a good point, namely, that if you have Q&A that\u2019s on the record, the opportunities for off-the-wall Qs that then dominate not just the As, but also the press conference, become pretty significant.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As the newest Governor, and therefore the last to speak, we\u2019re at the point where everything has already been said, but not everyone has had the chance to say it.  [Laughter]  So I will make a couple of comments.I would lean towards option 2, the explicit inflation objective, which has two virtues:  one is that it has the goal of anchoring inflation expectations, and the other is that it potentially has greater flexibility as an alternative form of stimulative policy, if credible.  If credible, I think an explicit inflation objective above the current target would raise inflation expectations, leading to a reduction in real interest rates.  As we know, an advantage of this tool is that we don\u2019t run into the lower bound problem because real interest rates can be negative.  Credibility on this policy option is critical.  What is going to happen if there\u2019s a divergence between the targeted inflation rate and the actual inflation rate.  Would we follow through.   For example, if we were in a situation where we had targeted, say, a 3 percent inflation rate, and in two years the unemployment level had miraculously fallen to 5\u00bd percent, and inflation, say, were 2 percent, would we allow unemployment to fall to get the inflation rate at 3 percent, or would we declare victory and say we are now at 5\u00bd percent unemployment, so we can now aim for 2 percent.  So I think the credibility component of using this objective in a stimulative way has some challenges. On option 3, price-level targeting, I think it might be difficult for us to have tight control on inflation on a year-to-year basis, because inflation changes with significant inertia.  Also, as the Cleveland paper points out, there could be a significant degree of overshooting, which also makes tight control difficult. The current approach has a problem, namely, how to keep inflation expectations anchored.  In other words, I think there are benefits in terms of increased demand, but those benefits may be small, and the future costs could be large.  I know this Committee is aware of those costs, which would be related to a post-recovery unwinding.  For example, banks\u2019 excess reserves could fuel enormous expansion in private credit and demand, and unwinding could be practically or politically difficult to achieve.  As an aside, let me note that the unwinding problem itself that\u2019s inherent in thecurrent approach could be helping to stimulate spending today by raising inflation expectations today.  But, again, the problem with this approach is that inflation expectations are not being anchored the way they could be, if we were to move to option 2.  So I prefer the explicit inflation objective, but I think we want to make sure we are dealing with the credibility issue.  Therefore, following through, once a recovery is under way, is important.  The financial markets don\u2019t know if the Fed is going to put on the brakes and start raising interest rates. I also wonder whether there\u2019s any virtue to telling markets explicitly that an inflation target will be maintained until certain events occur, so that the inflation target formulation would be conditioned upon a certain unemployment threshold\u2014or, if there are difficulties with quantifying an unemployment threshold, then it would be conditioned upon certain qualitative features having to do with the maximum employment goal.  Then, once unemployment crossed that threshold, or once certain qualitative features were met, as would be described very specifically, the target would be removed and reevaluated.  This would all need to be laid out ahead of time, so that there would be clarity regarding what the Committee may do in the future.  I\u2019ll stop there"], "2010FOMC20101103meeting.txt": [" MR. FISHER.  As you know, I feel very strongly about this issue.  In 1977 and 1978, President Carter had a group of three that wrote all of his decision memoranda\u2014Jeff Garten, a supervisor, and I.  By the time we wrote them and got them to him, which was a day after the economic policy group meetings, everything had been leaked to the press.  It was leaked by either principals or staff.  The reason for the leaks was either that they opposed the view or, frankly, that they just wanted attention\u2014they wanted to be big deals.  Now, there were a lot of problems with the Carter Administration, but this problem, in particular, was incredibly corrosive and divisive.  What I saw firsthand as the Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury was that it led to principals literally hating each other at the end of the process. That is not what this institution is all about.  I just want to underscore how divisive and dangerous it can be in undermining the mission of a great institution like this.  I hope that everybody in this room, whether sitting in the back rows or as principals at the table, is most mindful that this is a precious institution.  It is unique in Washington.  We can\u2019t undermine it by this kind of behavior.On the second issue of people that have close relationships with market participants, I think of it as akin to insider trading.  There are people who do profit.  There is one former Governor who recently visited my Bank when I was gone and who told the staff that the Reserve Bank Presidents are of no consequence at all to monetary policy, that their views are not considered, and that this individual\u2014I\u2019ll let you guess who it is\u2014was, in essence, the 18th or 19th member, depending on how many we have, of the FOMC, and the equivalent of a voting member.  He makes money off of us when he talks and sells.  If we can\u2019t solve this, then I think we should seriously look at some kind of firm legal strictures that are equivalent to the prosecution of insider trading.  If people make money off inside knowledge about our decisions, it\u2019s no different from people who make money off inside information trading securities.  In fact, I think it\u2019s a more grievous abuse. On the issue of speaking for others, here\u2019s exhibit A:  In Fed We Trust.  This was a disaster.  Whoever spoke to this writer, David Wessel, was duped by the trick that Michelle carefully warns against and that you refer to in your excellent memo.  I got a call from him a couple of months later saying, \u201cI understand that you changed your vote, that you walked down the hall, that you came back and talked to the Chairman, and that the Chairman announced the decision.\u201d  You\u2019ll remember that was when I dissented and then decided that I just didn\u2019t feel that was an appropriate thing to do and that it would undermine the cohesion of the group.  He knew more about what I had said than I did, and I had said it.  So somebody who was in this room reported, and maybe that person isn\u2019t in this room any longer.  This goes back to the point I was trying to make with the Carter experience:  \u201cPride goeth before a fall.\u201d  You may get attention at the time by talking to these people, but all you do is create divisive forces within the Committee.On the third matter, I think Janet made a very, very good point.  I think we have to be careful to get the right balance\u2014not to muzzle people, and, at the same time, because we\u2019re no longer dealing with the fed funds rate, to be very careful not to signal specific levels of, say, asset purchases or sales.  We create market expectations that way.  It gets discounted in the market.  We begin to become fearful of disappointing markets, even though I don\u2019t believe this Committee should ever be fearful of disappointing markets.  And we certainly shouldn\u2019t think in short-term consequences.  We are paid to think long-term about the health of our economy.  But I think it could be a worthwhile exercise. I feel most strongly about the first two.  And, Mr. Chairman, I ask you to be very firm on these issues.  There\u2019s no excuse for insider trading\u2014it\u2019s a criminal offense, and it should not occur.  In terms of speaking to others, or leaking materials from this room, it will do nothing but wreak havoc with this institution.  Thanks", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think we all agree that diversity of opinion is very important and that the public needs to know what arguments are being made.  I think the issue really is a question of style and tone and those sorts of things.  Governor Duke", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  One thing I will not do without further consultation with the Committee is hold a press conference right after an FOMC meeting.  I think that will require some discussion, because we would have to figure out how comfortable we are and how we would structure it and so on", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It sounds to me that that\u2019s more about the slope of the yield curve, but it seemed like the whole level is falling, although I may be misinterpreting what\u2019s in the data.  It seemed like the levels of real returns themselves are falling, and it\u2019s not just that theslope is getting shallower.  In fact, I think you could argue that the slope has not gotten shallower", "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to refer to exhibit 3, panel 17, the implied volatility of longer-term rates, and, in particular, I guess the implied volatility of a 10-year rate three years ahead.  You argued that this volatility has been declining.  Just in looking at this picture, I wonder whether this really does predict volatility three years out very well.  For example, the picture says that in 2006 and 2007 this market would not have expected very much volatility, which has turned out to be completely wrong", " MS. WEINBACH.2  I will be referring to the package labeled \u201cMaterial for Briefing on FOMC Participants\u2019 Economic Projections.\u201d  On balance, the projections you submitted for this meeting embody appreciably weaker real activity this year and trace a somewhat more gradual economic recovery than you anticipated in June.  Exhibit 1 shows the broad contours of your projections for 2010 through 2013 and over the longer run.  Nearly all of you see GDP growth, the top panel, picking up over the next couple of years, while the unemployment rate, the second panel, moves down slowly, and both headline and core inflation, shown in the bottom two panels, edge up but remain subdued.  Somewhat more than half of you indicated that these variables would likely converge to their longer-run rates within about five or six years, but the rest of you noted that unemployment may still be above or inflation below their longer-run rates at the end of that period.  2 The materials used by Ms. Weinbach are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).Exhibit 2 reports summary statistics regarding your projections for 2010.  As usual, your previous projections, collected in June, are shown in italics, and the memo items note the staff\u2019s Tealbook forecasts.  The central tendency of your current projections for real GDP growth this year, shown in the first column of the top panel, is a narrow band from 2.4 to 2.5 percent, down from 3 to 3\u00bd percent in June.  Looking at the middle column, the BEA\u2019s annual benchmark revisions and second-quarter data that were published after you submitted your June projections showed less rapid real GDP growth in the first half of 2010 than you or the staff had expected.  As shown in the third column, you have lowered your implicit projections for growth in the second half of this year quite a bit; they now exhibit a narrow central tendency centered on 2\u00bc percent, down from about 3 to 3\u00bd percent in June.  And, as shown in the second panel, the central tendency of your projections for the unemployment rate in the current quarter moved up about \u00bc percentage point.  Your expectations for overall and core inflation are shown in the bottom two panels.  The central tendency of your projections of overall inflation in the second half of this year, given in the right-hand column of the third panel, are now somewhat higher than in June, but your projections of core inflation, shown in the bottom panel, have changed little. Exhibit 3 displays the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for 2011 to 2013 and over the longer run.  Most of you see at least a modest pickup in the pace of the recovery next year with real GDP expanding about 3 to 3\u00bd percent, followed by increases of 3\u00bd to 4\u00bd percent in 2012 and 2013.  Nearly all of you retained your assessments of the longer-run rate of GDP growth, leaving the central tendency unchanged at 2\u00bd to 2\u00be percent. Regarding the unemployment rate, the second panel, you generally revised up your projections.  Most of you now expect the unemployment rate to be near 9 percent at the end of next year and to decline to about 7 to 7\u00bd percent by the end of 2013.  A number of you appear to attribute some of the increase in unemployment over the projection period to long-lived structural factors.  Indeed, more than one-third of you raised your projection of the rate of unemployment in the longer run, and the upper end of the central tendency of these projections rose from 5.3 percent to 6.0 percent.  The bottom of the central tendency remained at 5 percent. Even though your outlook for both overall and core inflation, depicted in the bottom two panels, has edged up since the June SEP, you generally continue to expect inflation to stay subdued over the next several years.  The central tendency of your projections for total PCE inflation is about 1 to 1\u00be percent in 2011 and 2012; it moves up to 1\u00bc to 2 percent in 2013.  However, most of you see a path for inflation through 2013 that does not exceed your longer-run inflation projections, which now exhibit a central tendency of 1.6 to 2.0 percent, a bit wider than in June. The staff\u2019s outlook as presented in the Tealbook embodies rates of real GDP growth that are at, or a bit above, the top end of the central tendencies of yourprojections for the next few years, and rates of inflation that are at the low end of your central tendencies.  The staff\u2019s projections of the unemployment rate are within the central tendencies of your projections.  Regarding your less optimistic outlook for growth, some of you noted reasons that reflected:  the view that further expansion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet would provide relatively little stimulus to the economy; anticipation of a substantial ongoing drag on growth from the housing sector, perhaps stemming from mortgage documentation problems; and expectations that lingering pessimism and risk aversion would continue to weigh on household spending and business investment and hiring. Regarding your monetary policy assumptions, about a third of you\u2014a somewhat smaller fraction than in June\u2014indicated that your assessment of appropriate monetary policy involved less accommodation than assumed by staff, in the form of less expansion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet going forward, a faster decline in the size of the balance sheet in the future, or a federal funds rate that lifts off sooner than in the staff\u2019s baseline forecast.  Only a couple of you thought that it would be appropriate to implement a more accommodative policy stance than the staff assumes, by expanding the balance sheet by more or by keeping the funds rate near zero for longer. Turning to your final exhibit, the two left-hand panels show that most of you continue to attach a relatively high degree of uncertainty to your projections of both real GDP growth, the top set of bars, and PCE inflation, the bottom set.  The two right-hand panels summarize your characterization of the balance of risks around these projections.  A majority of you now judge the risks to your current forecast of GDP growth to be balanced, although a significant number of you continue to view the risks as weighted to the downside.  Those seeing downside risks cited the fact that monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound, the limited potential for further fiscal stimulus to help address any future negative shocks to the economy, and concerns that the anticipated recovery of the housing market may take much longer than expected. The bottom right panel shows that most of you continue to judge the risks to your projection of PCE inflation as being broadly balanced, although some of you think that upside or downside risks predominate.  On the downside, some of you were concerned about the degree to which lingering resource slack could weigh on inflation, or continued low readings on actual inflation might show through to inflation expectations.  Those of you who cited upside risks to inflation generally noted uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Fed\u2019s withdrawal of policy accommodation, or a concern that the expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet could undermine the stability of longer-term inflation expectations.  Thank you.  That concludes our prepared remarks", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Right from the start, I think, a majority of the Committee has always disagreed with the staff outlook", "MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Until recently, I think the general pattern was that most participants expected monetary policy, the funds rate, to be lifting off noticeably earlier than staff.  That\u2019s been shifting, and some of the disagreement this time is that a couple of you expect policy to be easier.  So now it\u2019s on either side", " MR. ENGLISH.  So the disagreement was certainly less this time than last time", " MR. EVANS.  When you fill this out, it says if you disagree, please explain why.  The only way you can explain or provide any color is to disagree.  [Laughter]  So it\u2019s biased towards saying that you disagree", " MR. SHEETS.  Well, Canada tightened during the intermeeting period, but our best guess now is that Canada is going to stay put for a year or so\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s incorporated in ourforecast and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from the Bank of Canada.  I would be surprised, as I said in my remarks, if the ECB moved.  Regarding the Bank of England, I personally put more than 50\u201350 odds on it implementing further accommodative measures over the next six weeks or two months.  And I think that, once the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England moved, there would be intense pressure on the Bank of Japan to do something more.  It comes out every few months with incremental measures that are slightly more accommodative, but I think there would be pressure on it to do something in a significant fashion.  I can\u2019t think of changes at any other major central banks.  The Sveriges Riksbank also tightened over the intermeeting period but emphasized uncertain global conditions, so it seems that it may be in a \u201cstay put\u201d mode; and the Reserve Bank of Australia actually just tightened, which I take as a very positive signal about conditions in Asia", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I\u2019m not as convinced as you are that this is second order.  It is a very novel experience for the United States, fortunately, to have so many people unemployed for so long.  It just seems to me intuitively that that group would exert different kinds of downward pressures on wages, because when employers make hiring decisions, they will view those candidates very differently from those who have been unemployed for only 10 weeks", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There\u2019s been no significant change in my outlook since the September meeting, and, actually, there was no significant change between the August meeting and the September meeting.  That\u2019s not really good news for the economy insofar as my outlook is, I think, at the very bottom of everybody\u2019s projections, but you might have thought it was good news for you, at least, because I wouldn\u2019t have anything more to say.  [Laughter]  No such luck. What I\u2019ve been thinking about the last few weeks was actually prompted by some discussions that I had with some of my counterparts from foreign central banks during the Bank/Fund meetings a few weeks ago.  The discussions started on the topics of a double-dip recession and deflation, but they gravitated fairly quickly to considering the potential outcomes in industrial economies, such as the continental European economies and the U.S., if they face an extended period of very tepid growth, that is, growth at or slightly below trend.  In particular, the discussion focused on the degree to which such a period of growth could have some self-replicating characteristics, thereby producing some losses that would not necessarily be apparent just from extrapolation of a growth rate like that over time. So I asked myself:  Well, what are the prospects for growth.  And every single one of you is somewhat more optimistic than I am, though not a whole lot more.  There may well be some momentum building up over time simply because things will get better after a period of time when they stop getting worse, and it\u2019s for that reason that I actually have a little bit of upside risk on my own otherwise gloomy forecast.I also did try to look systematically at what are arguably leading economic indicators.  And I looked not just at those formally noted by the Conference Board, but also at other indicators drawn from the data that people here aggregate for us\u2014both objective ones, like housing permits and capital goods orders, and subjective ones, like consumer confidence and business sentiment.  Most, although not all, of those pieces of information are positive; most, although not all, are only mildly so, particularly considering the low baseline against which even positive data are being measured.  And I certainly didn\u2019t see a case for a pattern suggesting an acceleration of growth.  So it seemed to me not unreasonable to hypothesize that a relatively tepid pace of growth continues for some period of time.  Clearly, the handoff from one stage of recovery to another hasn\u2019t been smooth.  The period late last year and early this year of stimulus, inventory replenishing, and relief that the cataclysm had been avoided, has not led smoothly to a more self-sustaining growth supported by consumer demand.  That fact, too, seemed to me to reinforce the prospects for quite contained levels of economic growth going forward. What do I worry about under those circumstances.  Well, first, we\u2019re clearly in a liquidity bog, if not a liquidity trap.  And in the absence of an increase in aggregate demand, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any real prospect of pulling ourselves out of that mire.  Second\u2014and Eric alluded to this\u2014at some point we\u2019re likely to see some hysteresis effects taking hold in the labor market.  While I think that, to date, the evidence is fairly limited on whether skills mismatches have led to increasing structural unemployment, a high enough level of long-term unemployment will almost surely produce just such a result over time.  Third, while we know that firms are adding very little additional productive capacity in the face of weak demand, they may also be taking capacity off line or allowing their ability to increase production quickly to atrophy.  This phenomenon is probably the hardest of the three to document, in large partbecause we simply don\u2019t have data on capacity in the 80 percent or so of our economy that\u2019s not industrial.  But one suspects, or at least I suspect, that some of the firms that have been able to maintain rising profits in the face of sluggish sales have done so not just through increased efficiencies, but also through cost reductions effected by de facto capacity reductions. Now, each of these three factors would surely be reduced by sustained increases in aggregate demand, but, again, in the absence of prospects for increased employment, it\u2019s hard for me to see where that aggregate demand comes from.  So I think it\u2019s not inconceivable that we\u2019re facing a recovery even slower than the modest pace expected in the aftermath of a recession induced by a financial crisis, even slower than that reflected in the Tealbook, and even slower than the central tendency of our own forecast for this quarter.  But worse still, the economy could see a greater increase in the NAIRU and a lower level of potential growth because of the kinds of effects I mentioned a moment ago.  In that case, there would be a longer lasting impact of the slower period of growth, one that would stretch out for years even beyond those that we now anticipate.  So, in short, my concern is that a reluctance to provide further stimulus on the grounds that structural constraints limit growth at present could itself become a self-fulfilling prophecy. That kind of thought is overhanging my forecast, and it\u2019s also the way that I\u2019ll be thinking about policy tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. WARSH.  Thanks, Brian.  I have a couple of questions.  First, the way you describe the 35 percent cap seems a little different from what\u2019s in the statement you distributed.  As I understand it, you don\u2019t anticipate going above the cap, but you\u2019re saying it might happen on occasion, in which case you just want to make sure you have the flexibility to deal with that.  The statement says that we\u2019re suspending the per-issue limit and that some holdings will be allowed to move up \u201conly incrementally,\u201d and I\u2019m not sure that conveys the same thought.  Can you help me understand how you and the Desk will act on these Treasuries so that you\u2019re not restrained, yet you also don\u2019t signal to markets that there is no longer a cap.  That is, can this language be toughened.  For example, could you say in this statement, \u201cWe are going to suspend the 35 percent limit.  We still expect, by and large, to comply with it, but we have asked for and received flexibility as needed to move above it for the following reasons.\u201d  I worry a bit that this could get misperceived and the Desk might be seen as entering these markets and in some ways threatening to be more of a price-maker than a price-taker.  Maybe you can help me understand what you think your practice will be and whether this language can be made less open-ended and still let you do your job", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It says $600 billion in the first paragraph and $250 to $300 billion in the second paragraph", " MR. SACK.  Do you want me to answer", "MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  One main thing, and Nathan may want to talk about this, too, is going back not to the U.S. experience.  One key thing is looking at the Japanese experience where they, in essence, ran the experiment you\u2019re talking about, which was to increase greatly the monetary base.  Our assessment is that it did very little.  The Japanese, I think, are a little bit more optimistic about what they did, in that they think that did help hold up inflation expectations.  People have debated that one, but the general feeling is that just expanding reserves did very little to bolster the Japanese stock market or that sort of thing. For the United States, we haven\u2019t actually run the experiment you\u2019re talking about, so there\u2019s no way to look at any evidence to judge whether we\u2019d get a different result.  The logic of what we\u2019re doing is that, yes, there would be a difference, and if we just expanded reserves, the assumption we\u2019re making is that we would get very little for that", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a question about the wording in alternative A and the intention there.  In paragraph 4, you have some forward guidance, and inparticular the phrase, \u201cthe Committee continues to anticipate that, with such a policy stance, inflation in the intermediate term will not exceed levels consistent with its mandate.\u201d  What is the intention of this type of phrase.  What\u2019s your expectation.  What are we trying to convey there.  Does this mean that, as inflation begins to rise to the mandate level, there would be a presumption that it would never go over by a tenth, or what.  That\u2019s the issue that I have\u2014the public\u2019s and our interpretation of this", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The word \u201clevels\u201d actually creates some ambiguity", " MR. ENGLISH.  Well, it connotes that not all of your views are the same", " MR. FISHER.  We\u2019re trying to reassure people we are not going to go hog wild", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Back to Brian, at the risk of asking you to cover ground you\u2019ve already covered, I\u2019d like to understand a little more your thought process in striking the degree of transparency that you\u2019re proposing in this statement.  Are there arguments that you weighed against this degree of transparency.  And then, to echo what I think President Lacker referred to, what more could you do if you wanted to be more transparent", " MR. SACK.  That\u2019s right.  The statement says, \u201cThe distribution of purchases could change if market conditions warrant,\u201d and we see that as general enough to encompass all of the possibilities you discussed", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That\u2019s why we struck all this language we had in the videoconference, because we couldn\u2019t come to agreement on how to characterize it", " MR. EVANS.  Well, I just wanted to ask a question and offer a reaction to something that has come up at the last several meetings.  I second the proposal of characterizing what optimal policy is in some way that we could better appreciate.  President Bullard was absolutely correct when he pointed out that, after a big shock, optimal policy could well lead to fairly substantial gaps, or however you want to describe this outcome.  But it\u2019s also the case that bad policy would lead to gaps like that, too, and we need to understand why the current situation should be characterized as optimal and not simply bad.  [Laughter]  I mean, there is just a presumption here", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The October 15 Kiley et al. memo", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I see the additional asset purchases as appropriate insurance during a challenging phase of the recovery.  My baseline forecast hasn\u2019t changed meaningfully since our last meeting.  I still expect output growth to remain weak to moderate and inflation rates to remain well below the levels that I would consider consistent with our price stability objective. On several occasions in the past, after a long sequence of federal funds rate reductions, with a gradually improving outlook, the FOMC still chose to lower the fed funds rate as an insurance policy to reduce the likelihood of worst outcomes.  Although the alternative scenarios for further asset purchases described in the Tealbook suggest limited impacts on the real economy, a decision at this meeting to go ahead with some additional policy accommodationshould help to limit further disinflation.  I think there is some insurance value to be derived from solidifying recent progress and moving inflation expectations higher and closer to our long-run inflation objective.  I was concerned when financial market estimates of inflation expectations appeared to be dipping following the September meeting.  Inflation expectations have since recovered.  I view this as evidence that additional accommodation will help to lock in some of the progress that we\u2019ve made to date in moving inflation expectations up toward our price stability objective. Also, with inflation already so low, particularly for CPI-based measures, I think some insurance against further declines in inflation and inflation expectations is appropriate.  It\u2019s true that not all of the insurance moves exercised by past Committees were viewed as necessary after the fact.  However, it\u2019s also true that some insurance moves taken by past Committees when the economy seemed to be doing better sometimes turned out to have been insufficient.  Determining when to do a little more, or when to stop, is never easy.  But I can support additional accommodation to help stabilize inflation expectations.  Following such a strategy also enables us to do what we can to support an improved employment picture. On the statement language, I am concerned that in the minutes of our September meeting we indicated that we discussed providing a policy framework for further accommodation.  But it was evident during our videoconference call that finding a compromise for a framework is proving to be challenging.  In its current state, I see the language in alternative B as providing only the most general feedback mechanism for guiding policy adjustments. One way to provide a feedback mechanism would be to modify paragraph 4 from alternative A and insert it into alternative B.  I would simplify the language around the inflation outlook and make unemployment the last item in the list.  My proposed language for paragraph 4would read, \u201cThe Committee expects to maintain the target rate for the fed funds rate at 0 to \u00bc percent at least until mid-2012, so long as the Committee\u2019s outlook for inflation in the intermediate term remains consistent with its mandate, longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.\u201d  Language along these lines helps to link potential policy changes to inflation and inflation expectations, in addition to unemployment, which we all expect will remain elevated beyond 2012.  By providing this feedback mechanism, we can help to stabilize inflation expectations around our price stability mandate while also acknowledging our mandate for full employment in the long run.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I remain concerned about doing more quantitative easing or doing another large-scale asset purchase.  First, I perceive theexpected benefits of further\u2014I\u2019m going to keep saying \u201cquantitative easing\u201d because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve written here\u2014quantitative easing [laughter] to be small, especially in terms of inflation, but also in terms of unemployment.  The forecasts on pages 4 and 5 of the Tealbook Part A strike me as consistent with this view.  Second, I believe that quantitative easing may well have significant downside risks.  I will not go through these in great detail.  Others have spoken extremely eloquently about them:  President Fisher, President Hoenig, President Plosser, President Lacker, all elaborated on these risks at great length and, I\u2019m afraid, in a compelling way. But I will talk about one risk.  I think this is the most direct risk coming out of a large-scale asset purchase, because it\u2019s what the purchase is all about, namely, to take duration risk out of the private sector and transfer it to taxpayers\u2014that is what the heart of the LSAP is.  We have to be thinking about whom we\u2019re taking risk from and whom we\u2019re transferring it to.  The essence of the LSAP relies on a segmented markets view of the world, where there are some people participating in bond markets and other people who have less access to it.  The people who are participating in the markets are the ones who benefit from this.  The ones who are not participating are the ones who don\u2019t benefit.  This follows up on President Fisher\u2019s eloquent description of the distributional consequences of our policies.  Typically I would think the people who are participating in asset markets are wealthier and more educated, while the people who are not able to are less wealthy, less educated.  In addition, while staff work has been thorough and very compelling on the asset pricing side, the ultimate macroeconomic impact of this risk shift has remained murky to me. Despite these concerns, and given your arguments yesterday, Mr. Chairman, and given the strength of consensus among the voters in the Committee, and I\u2019ll emphasize the word \u201cvoters\u201d here, I\u2019m willing to go along with alternative B.  Let me talk about ways alternative Bcould be strengthened.  First, the word \u201cunacceptably\u201d in paragraph 2 seems to imply considerably more control over the recovery process than we actually have\u2014I think we\u2019re taking ownership for slow economic growth through that word.  I would recommend the word \u201cdisappointingly\u201d or more simply the word \u201ctoo.\u201d Second, and more substantively, I would go along with President Pianalto\u2019s recommendation of moving paragraph 4 from alternative A into alternative B, and I liked her rewording of it as well.  In general, it strikes me that an LSAP is not necessarily the most convincing tool that we have available.  I think forward guidance, as in paragraph 4 of alternative A, is a tool whose costs and benefits I understand better.  I think President Plosser\u2019s suggestion of cutting the interest rate on excess reserves also is something that we should study more\u2014again, it could help us achieve our dual mandate.  We\u2019re not competing with huge benefits on the table here\u2014the LSAP is not going to take us down to 5 percent unemployment\u2014so I think we have to explore all the possibilities. My third suggestion relates to paragraph 5 of alternative B.  It says we\u2019re going to do this regular review of the LSAP based on incoming information.  I would like to suggest that, after \u201cin light of incoming information,\u201d we add the phrase \u201cabout the rate of progress toward its objective.\u201d  The idea is that, if we were in the lucky circumstances of seeing 1.3 million jobs created over the next six months\u2014which I think is unlikely, I have to admit, given my own forecast\u2014that might lead us not to do further accommodation.  So I want to put the focus on the rate of progress, not the levels. Finally, I really feel that this institution faces a credibility problem if we are not clear that we expect we are going in the right direction, but we expect our movement to be \u201climited,\u201d \u201cmodest,\u201d \u201csmall\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t know what word you want to use.  I have not heard anyone aroundthe table suggest that we\u2019re going to be making striking progress toward our dual mandate by adopting this program.  I think we should be clear with the public about that, and the way we can do that is in our communication through the minutes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for taking the time yesterday to lay out your reasoning so completely.  In my time here, I\u2019ve learned to respect and be guided by your reasoning and your instincts, and I\u2019ve also learned to trust your integrity.  So I was pleased to hear your commitment to the notion that, if at any time the costs of these actions are unacceptably higher than expected, we will stop.  On that basis alone, I would probably be willing to support alternative B, but I came in here with a few other reasons to support this action and a few concerns. I don\u2019t disagree with the need for action.  I\u2019m just troubled by the limited projected results from this action.  Given the discussion of pace versus level, when I looked at the graphs in the inset box, it seemed to me that the difference between alternatives was less than one quarter in terms of time.  I may be a little wrong on that because the graphs were small and I didn\u2019t actually have a ruler, but that\u2019s what it looked like.  [Laughter]  Therefore, perhaps the strongest reason that I can find to proceed with LSAPs is the healing effect of low rates.  Understanding that banks and their customers need to heal before they reengage, it may be enough of a reason.  And while I think the benefits are small, I\u2019ve come to view the cost as equally small.  Although still untested on a large scale, our exit tools are at the ready, and inflation threats seem far away.  I\u2019m anxious about the potential for asset bubbles, but I do believe we have a tight enough clamp on the financial system to limit those risks at the moment. However, given that I expect the benefits to be small, I still question what\u2019s next.  It doesn\u2019t feel really right to choose a strategy because I think it\u2019s unlikely to do much harm if I also expect it to be unlikely to accomplish the mission.  While we\u2019re framing this action as state-dependent, I don\u2019t see much actual room to maneuver in reaction to different economic conditions.  With total monthly purchases as a constraint, our actual ability to react to incomingdata going forward seems limited to extending or not extending the time frame and the total amount.  I wholeheartedly endorse President Kocherlakota\u2019s suggestion that we need to understand how we would define good and bad outcomes and what we might do in response to them.  I\u2019m not sure how much scope we actually have, but it sounds like many around the table have different expectations about what comes next. Let me end with two reservations, just in case anyone missed them when I wove them into my comments yesterday.  We\u2019ve talked about the difference between LSAPs and quantitative easing, but the fact is we will be injecting more reserves into the system.  The last time we had large purchases, reserves didn\u2019t grow very much.  They had already grown as banks snapped up much needed liquidity, so, for the most part, our purchases represented a substitution of assets purchased for liquidity facilities\u2019 repayment.  For their size, the LSAPs didn\u2019t really expand our balance sheet or the reserves very much.  But the banking system doesn\u2019t have the same thirst for additional liquidity at this time, so we need to monitor the response to additional reserves.  My second reservation comes from my concern about the mortgage market.  I can\u2019t tell from the staff projections how much of the benefit of this action is expected to come from improvements in house prices or the mortgage market, but I still believe that channel is too broken to work. In summary, I support alternative B with the understanding that we will closely monitor the costs and benefits as we go along and hope that we will also continue to look for even stronger actions or uses of our tools to improve the outlook for unemployment. Turning to the statement, I do prefer \u201cdisappointingly slow\u201d to \u201cunacceptably slow.\u201d  And I don\u2019t like the \u201cup to\u201d language\u2014I think that conditions it too much.  As to paragraph A4, I think markets already expect that timing, so I don\u2019t see that it adds anything in terms ofexpectations, and I thought President Fisher\u2019s suggestion, \u201cwhile maintaining a firm commitment to keep inflation within levels consistent\u201d and so on might signal the same thing and in a more efficient way.  Finally, I do sort of prefer the discussion of rate of progress rather than levels.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  You mean the natural rate", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Others.

So we\u2019ll add \u201cover the longer run.\u201d The second one that got some support was from President Kocherlakota and it referred to the phrase \u201cunacceptably slow.\u201d  I would propose getting rid of the phrase \u201cit judges that,\u201d because we wouldn\u2019t judge disappointment, so that the last phrase would be \u201cprogress towards its objectives has been disappointingly slow.\u201d  All right.  [No response]  Okay. There are a couple of other suggestions.  One was motivated by President Fisher\u2019s comment\u2014I\u2019m talking now about his comment about inflation and price stability.  There\u2019s a bit of anxiety, I think, about phrases that involve intentional increases in inflation, admittedly.  So here\u2019s a proposal:  In the two places where we have the phrase \u201cto return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate,\u201d how about changing it to \u201cto help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate.\u201d  The revision doesn\u2019t have the sense of having to push it up, and it also finesses the differences among us about what the inflation target is", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

The problem has to do with the fact that the flow rate is not equivalent to the level of the funds rate.  The way we connect these things is by thinking about the total stock of holdings and what the relationship is to the level of the interest rate.  I don\u2019t think, therefore, that an emphasis on the flow primarily\u2014and I know President Bullard disagrees with me\u2014is enough information.  There needs to be some kind of marker about what our expectation is in terms of the total purchases.  And I\u2019d like to add that, just as it was easy to stop the $300 billion Treasury program you mentioned because we had given a number, so it will be easier to stop this if we have given a number.

What would be the interpretation of extending longer than six months.  Is there a risk that that would be interpreted as more alarmist in some way", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Does the ECB have a preference in terms of the length of extension", " MR. SHEETS.  I\u2019m not sure", "MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The tenor of the incoming data has been positive, though not much different from what was expected in most forecasts, and it is broadly consistent with only a very gradual recovery.  Even with the announcement of both fiscal and financial stimulus, the Tealbook is little changed from our November meeting.  For the final quarter of 2012, the Tealbook forecasts unemployment to be 0.1 percentage point higher and core PCE inflation to be 0.1 percentage point lower than at the November meeting.  Similarly, the Blue Chip forecast is not much different from last month.  Thus, despite the move to more accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, we are still expecting only very slow progress on an inflation rate that is too low and an unemployment rate that is too high. While the inflation forecasts are little changed, the decline in core inflation has continued.  In fact, the core CPI inflation rate for the last 12 months, at 0.6 percent, is the lowest since 1957 when the index began.  As the Tealbook inflation box shows, the diffusion index and a wide variety of inflation measures provide ample evidence of continued disinflation.  While commodity prices have certainly increased, there seems little ability to pass these increases on to final goods prices, given the significant slack in the economy.  Discussions with businesses around New England highlight that they have used productivity gains to offset rising commodity prices, because they see little ability to pass price increases on to their customers.   Our announcement of further large-scale asset purchases has spurred considerable discussion about the potential for them to create undesirable inflationary pressures.  For our excess reserves to translate into future inflation or debt-financed asset bubbles, banks would have to increase lending significantly.  This is not what we see.  In the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom, lending has remained very weak, despite the infusion of liquidity by central banks in all three countries.In addition, discussions with bankers do not indicate that a significant upsurge in demand in this country is imminent\u2014rather, quite the opposite.  Bankers continue to experience weak demand for loans, particularly among smaller businesses.  While I do not expect these trends to reverse any time soon, if they do, they should be quite observable, allowing us to take appropriate actions when that becomes necessary. With the outlook little changed, it is probably worthwhile thinking about the risks to the forecast.  The Tealbook highlights a much weaker path for house prices.  While I am not particularly confident of our ability to forecast house prices, significant further declines in house prices have the potential to weaken bank balance sheets significantly, further complicate the ability to remove the foreclosure overhang, and cause consumers to retrench as their confidence ebbs along with their housing wealth. A second concern is the increasing difficulties with state and local finances, which some have compared with the problems with peripheral nations in Europe.  While I do not think the analogy to Europe is particularly apt, these problems share one common attribute, and that is that the lack of political will to address problems may make the problems significantly worse. My biggest concern remains Europe.  With announcements in late spring regarding Greece, many hoped that the problem would be postponed for several years, and that Europe would find a way to muddle through.  As events over the last month have made clear, the situation remains fragile, and confidence in banks remains tenuous.  Clearly, the Irish stress test of their banks did not uncover the significant weakness in Irish banks, and concern with other stress tests has contributed to some creeping up of interbank rates.  Should European problems become more severe, I do worry about the transmission through U.S. banks and money marketfunds.  U.S. prime money market funds with $1.6 trillion in assets have European exposures that now account for over 60 percent of their assets.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "] MR. EVANS.  That is austere.  Finally, what about inflation expectations.  Survey measures of inflation continue to be low.  TIPS break-even rates and inflation swaps have risen over the past several months.  Still, the TIPS increases have only retraced the declines that occurred last spring and summer, and back in April before the TIPS decline, the Greenbook\u2014it was a Greenbook back then\u2014had a core PCE inflation forecast of 0.9 percent in 2010 and beyond.  So, ultimate inflation pressures were quite similar.  In sum, the risks of unacceptably higher inflation are small over the relevant policy horizon, and I certainly agree with your comments, Mr. Chairman, that we could address any unexpected and damaging inflationdevelopments quickly should they occur.  However, at the moment I\u2019m much more concerned that inflation will continue to run below mandate-consistent levels.  In fact, it would be a very positive development if inflation rose more quickly, at least to 2 percent. I just wanted to mention that I disagreed with Governor Warsh\u2019s characterization of the rise in inflation at the last meeting that he referred to as the nominal revenue channel.  You know, that\u2019s more money illusion, and this finding that higher inflation would be beneficial comes out of fully optimizing models where there is no money illusion.  By lowering real rates, such a development would help us to do better on our employment objective.  It would change opportunity costs, and it is difficult to imagine strongly sustained higher inflation without growth in broad monetary aggregates, bank lending, and growth more generally.  So, as of now, in my judgment, the pace of economic recovery and inflation outlook continues to be too weak to be consistent with our mandates for the relevant forecast horizon, but things are better today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I believe the state of the recovery is more promising than it was at the November FOMC meeting, but I see considerable continuing downside risks in terms of both price stability and unemployment.  Information we have received for this meeting suggests considerable reasons for optimism.  In particular, private domestic final purchases are looking stronger, business purchases of equipment and software are increasing, and wholesale inventories and merchandise trade have been marked up.  Since the last meeting, equity prices are higher, the yield curve is steeper, and risk spreads have narrowed.  I read these financial indicators as implying that financial markets could be recovering from their nervous conditions of this spring.  Given these stronger indicators and the additional confidence provided by our latest program of large-scale asset purchases and by the likelihood of more fiscal stimulus, I think there are some reasons for cautious optimism that the recovery is on a path to becoming stronger.There remain, however, significant downside risks.  Specifically, in addition to the continued weak housing market, problems in Europe, and weaker banks, the recent decrease in measures of core inflation, I believe, bears continued attention.  While I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re in serious danger of deflation, I hope that the continuing decline in core inflation does not eventually affect inflation expectations and, thereby, lower wages as well as raise real interest rates.  While break-even inflation rates have been stable since our last meeting, professional forecasters, as measured by the Livingston survey, appear to be revising their forecasts downwards, and the level of economic slack continues to be substantial.  If inflation continues to fall, becoming difficult to reverse, inflationary expectations could become unanchored, and I worry that rising real interest rates could offset the added monetary and fiscal expansion.  Thank you", "MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support alternative B.  I believe some patience in letting the effects of the new LSAP materialize is warranted.  I would also say that in my view the reversal of the summer\u2019s downward trend in longer-term inflation expectations represents an early sign of the success of our current policy course. Though I don\u2019t feel any adjustment of policy is needed at this juncture, and though I am comfortable with the statement language as presented, I would favor in the coming meetings a more thorough discussion of the broad policy framework the Committee believes it has adopted and how it should be conveyed in the statements going forward.  In that regard, I would like to comment for a second in more detail about the language in alternatives A and C.  Like others on the Committee, I think the policy concern of the moment is communication.  The reason I asked Bill English the question about the $200 billion change signaling potentially a sequence of adjustments on a more open-ended path is that it strikes me that A and C could be interpreted as a first step in a sequence.  In that light, the language seems to signal a move toward an approach to policy that resembles the funds rate targeting approach when the zero lower bound did not pertain.  In alternative A, for example, it has already been mentioned that an additional $200 billion might be viewed as roughly equivalent to a 25 basis point cut in the fed funds rate. In my mind, this asset purchase analogue to funds rate targeting adds two characteristics that the Committee might consider beginning to convey in statements.  First, a sequence of similar moves is likely unless economic conditions change in some significant way.  And, second, the total value to which the sequence of moves accumulates is left unstated, because that quantity is conditional on economic conditions.  If this is not the policy framework we intend to communicate, then the language needs to be carefully constructed to avoid any confusion about our policy strategy.  So I\u2019d like to advocate that, whatever action we take next on the assetpurchase program, we convey it choosing language that more openly reflects a deliberate Committee choice about our policymaking framework for the foreseeable future.  I hope, therefore, that at the next meeting we might devote a little time to discussion of our policy framework options and the content of communications that would convey them and support the effectiveness of the chosen approach.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  MR. LOCKHART.  I have, in some respects, a more narrow idea.  I think some of the debate over time has been about a discretionary versus rules-based approach, so it\u2019s that tension that I have in mind.  To explain what I mean, I describe our approach today as involving meeting-by-meeting reviews that result in decisions around a fairly large asset purchase program that is closed-ended, in the sense that a final cumulative target for purchases is explicitly stated.  In contrast, it has been suggested before that the Committee adopt an incremental approach with the cumulative purchase target left open.  So that\u2019s what I am trying to convey", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I listened to the discussions today during the first go-round, it does appear that many have revised up their forecast, as I have.  I also expect inflation, as others have said, to start low, but I do expect it to increase slowly over time.  I join those who would like to see immediate stronger growth and lower unemployment.  I continue to judge that additional monetary stimulus carries more long-term risk than short-term advantage to our economy. The economy is undergoing a major and necessary rebalancing that includes the deleveraging of consumers, financial institutions, and state and local governments.  The process will take time, and shortcuts are costly.  With the amount of stimulus in place and the extended size of our combined balance sheets, the effect on expectations, confidence, and asset prices will be significant once we initiate or hint at initiating an exit involving even the most modest steps from our current highly, in my opinion, accommodative policy.  Thus, the process of exit from an accommodative policy will be a major challenge, far more so than we\u2019re willing to acknowledge today, in my opinion.  It starts from the very fact that we are easing into an improving economy because unemployment is too high.  Then there would be the obvious concern that, as we start to raise interest rates, the initial downward effect on asset prices andfinancial activity will be outsized.  The markets will despair.  As a result, I suspect pressure for the Committee to delay its exit from current policy will be significant. I suspect the challenge will only increase for the Committee going forward from here.  I\u2019m already hearing today that we can\u2019t change because we\u2019ve set this path for ourselves.  The funds rate is near zero.  Our balance sheet is growing, approaching $3 trillion, and excess reserves are approaching $1.5 trillion.  Accordingly, the longer the Committee delays in preparing for exit, the greater the difficulty of doing so in a timely manner, increasing systematically the likelihood that it will inadvertently invite future imbalances in inflation impulses because of the delay. Mr. Chairman, you mentioned 2003, and I remember it well.  We talked a lot about not wanting a repeat of Japan, being afraid of deflation and not having enough inflation.  So the Committee delayed, held back.  Unemployment was too high at that time, at 6\u00bd percent.  I worry about our focus on unemployment even though I\u2019m as concerned about it as you are. And when we exit, we\u2019ll require time, I realize.  Nonetheless, we should begin that long process now.  We first should adjust talk of the need for further monetary stimulus.  We should indicate that sufficient stimulus is in place to attain over time long-run potential growth for the economy.  It won\u2019t come quickly, but it will come.  We also need to reopen our dialogue about an exit strategy so that we don\u2019t shock the market as we move forward from here. Of the options presented, I would take some combination of C and D, but I won\u2019t go into that, because I know that\u2019s not on the table today.  But I will, in summary, say that I believe that our current highly accommodative monetary policy is inconsistent with our long-run mandate in an economy that is recovering and shifting from transitory, I think, to sustained sources of growth and picking up some speed.  To maintain such a highly accommodative policy in thiseconomic environment increases the risk of imbalances developing in the longer term and the risk of longer-term inflation expectations necessarily rising over time. We need to begin shifting our language to regain policy flexibility and avoid locking ourselves deeper into a long-term policy position that is becoming in my opinion, of course, increasingly difficult to reverse in a timely fashion with each additional step over the next six months.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B as well.  For the reasons stated by Narayana and Kevin, I wish that it communicated rather more precisely than I think it does what the threshold for a change in our intended path ought to be, but it\u2019s 12:35 p.m., and if we get into a discussion of that, we\u2019re not likely to finish in a timely fashion. I would also reinforce Kevin\u2019s caution about the impact of \u201cFOMC chatter.\u201d  We used to refer to that as what other people said about the FOMC.  Now it\u2019s the FOMC itself that seems intent on chattering continuously in a way that I just don\u2019t think is helping communications or the integrity and external perception of this Committee.  That\u2019s it.  Everything else looks fine", "VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I do want to talk about how we communicate as a group to the market and the public.  I think we\u2019ve done a very poor job relative to what we\u2019re capable of, and I think that judgment is borne out in a number of ways.  One way is the low score we received in the recent primary dealer survey conducted by the Desk, even though the survey and its comments said the Chairman did a very good job on 60 Minutes.  That was cited by a number of the respondents. It is not helpful for opponents of any policy we embark on, whether asset purchases or other actions, to criticize the policy in public in harsh terms as soon as possible after an FOMC meeting is over.  I really do think there are right ways and wrong ways to disagree.  I think dissent is completely appropriate, and I\u2019m not trying to discourage that.  I think the right way is to say that reasonable people may disagree, but this is the decision made by the Committee.  This is why the Committee is doing what it\u2019s doing, and here\u2019s how the Committee expects this particular policy action is likely to work in practice. I think the wrong way is to paint the consequences of the decision in more apocalyptic terms and/or to create doubts and fan fears about the ability and/or will of the FOMC to execute policy successfully.  In my opinion, some of the most recent comments we\u2019ve seen have undermined the effectiveness of the most recent round of LSAPs.  I say this not only because of our poor communications score, but also because the evidence suggests that a good portion of the backup in bond yields is due to a higher risk premium.  When I ask myself how the higher risk premium got there, obviously it was the critique of the Fed by outside observers, but I think we also did a little bit of that to ourselves.  I think the higher risk premium stems from uncertainty about our commitment to the program\u2014in other words, would we be cowed by the criticism\u2014and thereby represents a loss of credibility on our part.That being said, it isn\u2019t the only reason that bond yields have risen.  I think there are lots of other reasons, and they\u2019ve been talked about this morning.  First, expectations going into the last meeting were for a somewhat larger program than what we actually initiated.  Second, Treasury supplies likely increased due to the shift in fiscal policy, so the net supply held by the public is going to go up relative to what the public expected.  And, third, the economy looks like it\u2019s on a more solid growth track.  So these three factors all interact.  More stimulative fiscal policy implies faster growth, and it implies more net supply, as well as a smaller expected LSAP program. Overall my policy view hasn\u2019t changed.  The LSAP program still makes sense, and it\u2019s helping at the margin.  We have damaged its effectiveness to some degree.  I think it\u2019s important in reaching this conclusion to note that some of the primary risks of the asset purchase program, such as dislodging inflation expectations to the upside or causing a free fall in the dollar, have not materialized in any way.  Instead, the dollar has been strengthening, and the increase that we\u2019ve seen in the yields have occurred entirely in real rates rather than in break-even inflation rates, at least as we measure them from November to today.  So I\u2019m with pretty much everybody else, not quite everyone, in supporting alternative B.  I think we want to have a \u201clow drama\u201d meeting as Governor Duke said.  So I don\u2019t mind playing possum either.  I think the small changes contemplated in alternative B are right.  They acknowledge some of the intermeeting data.  We still have a long way to go in terms of our dual mandate. A very accommodative policy stance to me is still fully appropriate.  Any retreat from our LSAP program at this juncture I would view as disastrous, not just because yields would back up further, tightening financial conditions, but also because such a shift would significantly undercut our credibility.  We would be viewed as weak and as intimidated by outside criticismand political pressure, and that would be, I think, devastating to this institution.  To my mind, this would cause our independence and our will to keep inflation in check over the longer term to be questioned.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman"]}
