{"1987FOMC19870211meeting.txt": ["MR. CROSS. The Japanese tell us that their total long-termcapital outflows are continuing at the same level as last year. Wedon't know, but there seems to be more diversification; to a greaterextent there is Japanese investment in Australia and Canada and insterling also. There is also more diversification in the types ofinstruments, we think. But we don't have very good information.Another problem is that there is a tendency by Japanese investors toengage in hedging operations. Even if they continue the long-termcapital outflows, they may at the same time be hedging on the exchangerate side and that has effects on the exchange market. There seemedto be a considerable amount of hedging during the period when thedollar/yen rate changed from the 158-159 level where it had stood fora while. As it broke through that level, a number of Japaneseinvestors seemed to engage in some hedging. To summarize, theJapanese capital outflows seem to be more diversified, but there mightbe other things that are taking place which are offsetting some of theexchange market effects", "MR. CROSS. That is another point; the German economy isclearly doing less well than it appeared to be a month ago", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Closer, yes. Close enough, I don't know.Partly, I think, as a result of the election there is more pressure inGermany politically to do something. Plus, the economy quite visiblyis not doing so well. seems very resistant tochanging what the economy is doing in any short period of time; he isnot exactly a fine tuner. Nonetheless, he is bound to put somewhatmore pressure on that side. And I think the Japanese are more worriedthan they were. These countries get really worried about theirexchange rates but they sure don't move very fast to take what seem tobe the necessary steps. Actually, neither of them is going to doanything very dramatic. What you hear talked about in both cases is2/10-11/87probably a tax reform program--fixing it up so there is some revenueloss over the next year", "MR. HELLER. It seems that the Germans are emphasizing[domestic demand] a lot as well as the GNP numbers that we focus onand that look pretty discouraging. Domestic demand is expanding at 4to 4-1/2 percent and the difference is going to imports. I thinkthat's where our perspective and their perspective are reallydifferent. They say as long as we have a 4 to 4-1/2 percent domesticdemand expansion, we don't mind the low production figure at home aslong as the rest goes into imports. That way we make our contributionto international adjustment.SPEAKER(.). [Unintelligible]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Three percent domestic demand is not muchin terms of what we would like to see. They'd have to get to fivepercent or something like that; four is better than three", "MR. HELLER. If you had expanding credit demands--it is clearhow that can happen as it did in that year-end period--under ouroperating procedures you just can't adjust your projections ofrequired reserves quickly enough to adapt. On an on-going basis andin a more orderly fashion, can that phenomenon create greaterpressures in the funds market", "MS. SEGER. Doesn't it take pressure on reserves to move thefed funds rate as it has moved. I realize that there were unusualcircumstances; nevertheless, there must have been some temporaryreserve pressure to have pumped it up so. I think you said the ratewas 38 percent at one time; that doesn't sound like it was excessivelyeasy", "MR. MORRIS. [We haven't] as far as the smaller banks", "MR. JOHNSON. I don't see how that would explain the changeat the end of the year and the continuation now. I think there issomething over and above that CRR that is making them hesitant,because the funds rate was behaving fairly consistently before", "MR. BLACK. A couple of our banks reported that they couldn'tfind the federal funds. The market had dried up, as far as they wereconcerned", "MR. PARRY. I have a question for Mike Prell on personalincome and savings, chart 14. I think it may have some implications-10-2/10-11/87for the PCE forecast. The saving rate clearly has been coming down inrecent years. Your forecast would have that saving rate trendingdown--not looking at the quarterly pattern, but on average--in 1987and 1988. Of course, if that did not occur there would be someimplications, potentially, for the growth of consumption. Withdisposable income rising more slowly, I can understand why it might bea difficult environment in which to build savings, but at the sametime I have difficulty seeing the rates coming down to those levels.I don't know if you can ever find saving rates down at those levels.Continuing that trend would be of considerable interest andsignificance", "MR. TRUMAN. No, I would say net of oil, probably ourinflation improvement is not as good. Because if all of the othercommodity prices were fixed in dollars, and the dollar was declining-13-2/10-11/87against deutschemarks, yen, and so forth, and you take oil out, youhave [unintelligible]", "MR. PARRY. I would start out by saying that our forecast isnot very different from that of the Board staff. But I do want tocomment a bit on the risks that I see to the forecast because I thinkthey could have implications for policy. It would appear to me thatthe risks as far as inflation is concerned are on the up side. Wehave assumed that the recent decline in the value of the dollar islargely permanent and that the dollar will end 1987 at a lower levelthan we had in our previous forecast. The pass-through of priceincreases resulting from the dollar's decline has been slow to date,but I believe profit margins of many foreign suppliers of goods to theUnited States are really quite narrow at the present time and,therefore, future pass-throughs could be considerably greater.Secondly, it seems that the momentum of oil prices at the present timeis in the direction of rising oil prices, or at least not declining.Thus, our assumptions about oil prices could turn out to be too lowand inflationary pressures more intense. The dollar and also the oilprice issue are largely factors that one would presume would betemporary as far as inflation is concerned. But a third risk forinflation would be more prolonged, I think, in its impact. The staffprojection of the unemployment rate at year end is around 6-1/2percent. By some estimates that rate gets close to full employmentand thus any positive shock to demand could produce more serious pricepressures than are included in the forecast.-15-2/10-11/87On the real side, I am basically comfortable with the staff'sestimate of just under 3 percent, although there is a risk to theprojection, probably, on both sides of the forecast. I would like tonote two risks on the downside. The first one I really was hinting atwhen I asked the question about the saving rate. It seems to me thatit is conceivable for the saving rate not to deteriorate from theselevels. If that were the case, it's possible that consumption wouldgrow at a somewhat slower pace than is incorporated in the forecast.Obviously, another major uncertainty on the real side is net exports.We have talked about that considerably, but to me a conservativestance would be to assume that the failure of the dollar to declinerelative to currencies of numerous important trading partners willlead to an improvement in net exports that is somewhat less than theBoard staff's number.On the regional front, we continue to see growth a bit fasterthan the rest of the nation. Last year we saw employment up 3.5percent compared to 2.3 percent nationwide. We also saw a huge jump--67 percent--in California building permits in December, but that was aresponse to a large builders fee that went into effect January 1.It's interesting to note that the increase significantly added to thenational totals; it probably caused about 17 percent of the increasein the December leading indicators. So it was not an insignificantdevelopment. A couple of other points in the District: We had arather interesting experiment regarding the effects on consumerbehavior of the removal of the sales tax deduction. Oregon does nothave a sales tax, and consequently, one of the things that we observedwas that there was no surge in car sales in Oregon in contrast to theyear-end surge in other states with sales taxes. We also heard from amember of our small business and agricultural advisory council thatapparently one major Japanese car maker is beginning to ship strippeddown models to the U.S. I think that is interesting because it maymean that the volume of Japanese car imports may not decline as muchas had been expected and that, conceivably, price competition in theindustry may turn out to be more intense. Finally,pointed out to us thathe was having much greater success in selling to the Canadians becausethey were now substituting our exports for French exports. We havebeen focusing on the failure of the Canadian dollar and the currenciesof [unintelligible] countries to appreciate and thus to enable us tocut down on our imports. One thing that is sort of interesting isthat the failure of their currencies to appreciate relative to ours isprobably raising some export opportunities that perhaps we have notbeen focusing on", "MR. FORRESTAL. If we have a difference with the staff, it'son the inflation side as well. We see pressure on prices probablyoccurring more towards the end of the year than at the beginning, andwe are attributing that basically to a greater impact from importprices than we had thought earlier. We have done some studies thatsuggest that the decline of the dollar is going to affect these importprices somewhat. Those studies are certainly not definitive by anymeans, but my hunch is that they are probably right. So we arelooking at the deflator to be at about 3-1/2 percent; we think it isreally somewhat unrealistic to see the deflator stuck at 3 percent,which is what the staff is forecasting for three quarters. On the GNPside, we are closer to the staff but a little lower; therefore, ourforecast is a little less sanguine than the Board staff's. Some ofthat activity that we saw in December could very well have been taxrelated. I hope it's more than that and that there is some momentumin the economy; but we will just have to wait and see on that. But wethink that GNP is probably going to grow around 2-1/2 percent.Consistent with that slower rate of growth, we have a slightly higherunemployment rate at year-end, although it's not significantlydifferent. So the real difference that we have is on the inflationside", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we are more on the optimistic side,like some of our brethren are, I am comforted to see. We may havebeen overly influenced by the signs of a turnaround in manufacturingin recent months than by the flurry of good statistics that has justhit in the face of a great deal of liquidity in the economy. We putin 3-1/2 percent as the rate of growth in real GNP, and we have theunemployment rate coming down to 6.4 percent. So far as our analysisis concerned, we are pretty much in agreement with the staff on theforces that are at work in that we think there is going to be a markedimprovement in the net export picture and that it's going to be a-20-2/10-11/87major contributor to growth. We also agree with the conclusion thatgross domestic purchases are going to grow more slowly, but we differmainly in that we think that there are going to be more real personalconsumption expenditures. The staff has projected just 1-1/2 percentgrowth fourth quarter to fourth quarter. It is certainly true that wehave a lot of debt there, but we also have some factors that offsetthat negative in the growth of wealth. So our guess is that PCE isgoing to be somewhat higher than their forecast. Coincidentally, Isuppose, we had about the same kind of growth in real disposableincome last year as they are projecting for 1987 and we had a 4percent rise in real consumer expenditures. Against this moreoptimistic forecast, we have inflation near the high side, at 3.8percent. I am a little comforted to see that someone else is thereand even more comforted by one of the Board member's forecast of realGNP of 4 percent. For once I am not the high one on that. We thinkthat inflation is going to stem from this stronger projection of realgrowth; that ought to tend to reduce this remaining slack in labor andproduct markets, particularly in the second half of the year. Insofaras the risks are concerned, I would say that the risks are that thenumbers are going to come in somewhere between our forecast and theBoard staff's", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. By their standards. On the importside, the question I keep asking myself is: If we have a shortfall2/10-11/87from this kind of consensus forecast on the export side, is there anygood possibility that we can make up the difference on the importside. That to me is a tough one. Indeed, it's a \"Catch-22\" becausewhen I look at the nature of the import situation here in the UnitedStates now, with the infrastructure that goes with it in so manyproduct lines, it just seems to me that to break out of that mold thatTed has in his forecast, we are probably going to have to have prettysharp price increases for imports. That's something we haven't seenyet; and if we start to see it, it's just going to add that much morepressure on the domestic inflation side. So, I am not sure we canmake up any shortfall on the export side. But if we do, I am afraidthat we are going to make it up at the cost of higher inflation. So,as I said, right now I am a bit on the cold side of the tradesituation, but that will change next week, I suspect.On the purely domestic side, like Mr. Stern and a couple ofothers, I've got to say I am impressed with not just the Januaryemployment numbers, but the collection of numbers over the past threeor four months which, net, have been stronger than I would haveexpected, especially in the circumstances of the tax change. Thosedevelopments will probably lead me to be marking up my forecast alittle. Putting it all together, I would say that the risks are aboutsymmetric at this point. I have a little of that nagging sense ofunease that Ed Boehne spoke about in terms of the inflation situation,although I can't pin it down either. If you go through unit laborcosts and productivity exercises, you still get numbers that lookrespectable, at least in terms of deflators. But there is at leastthat nagging feeling that this tremendous amount of liquidity that weput into the economy ought to do something at some point. And rightnow all it seems to be doing, in some sense, is feeding the financialsector. That in itself constitutes a risk because I continue to see arather sharp--and in some ways an ever sharper--dichotomy between thefinancial sector of the economy and the real sector of the economy.And I just don't see how that is sustainable. I think there are risksright there in terms of something going astray which, in turn, couldimpair confidence in the world in a detrimental way", "MR. ANGELL. Yes, relatively worse, right. In a sense, Isuppose my forecast, at 1.9 percent real GNP, is optimistic in thatthe non-U.S. world output would seem to be hardly higher than 2percent and it would seem appropriate that we would be a little lessthan the rest of the world. So I guess I feel very comfortable thatif we can do it that wouldn't be bad at all. As I looked at theexport side, I noted from St. Louis' recent publication that U.S.export prices over the last six years have risen a total of 11percent, which would be less than 2 percent a year. Our staffforecast has an 11 percent increase in export prices over the next twoyears. In the world that I see, it is somewhat unlikely that thatkind of increase in export prices would occur. On the import side, Ialso noted in that same study that U.S. imports as a percentage of GNPhave been so constant; they just don't change very much. So I justdon't hold much hope for any reduction of imports by relative pricing.That is, the price elasticities seem to be such that we are not goingto make much gain there. Frankly, I don't see that we are going tomake quite as good a move on the trade side as even the staffforecast, and that's not very good.When I look at dangers, I suppose there are two kinds ofdangers. I tend to set aside the stagflation scenario; I don't seethat as very likely. On inflation, my estimate is only 1/2 of apercentage point different from the staff, and I don't see that to bevery large. But if we both missed, if there was higher growth andmore inflation, I guess that would provide us a very decided monetarypolicy option which would be, I presume, higher U.S. interest rates;and that would be good for the dollar. If we had higher growth, itwould be good for a lot of sectors of the domestic economy. So Iassume that if we missed in that direction we would have a responsethat would be appropriate both domestically and internationally. Theproblem I see would be if we get too slow and the world gets too slow.And if the U.S. gets too slow, then I wonder what the policy responsemight be because that might put downward pressure on U.S. interestrates. I'd hate to see that happen with equity prices maybe goingeven higher than they are today, which might be an unsustainable path.So that's the kind of worry that I have: that we might get too slow[economic growth] and get declining interest rates. This would putthe dollar in a precarious position, and we might not have good policyoptions. So, I guess I do worry some", "MS. SEGER. Well, having said that, I am in his camp againwith a low number for real GNP growth--something on the order of 2percent, which is below the staff's. I have two main reasons fordeparting from the staff forecast. One is that I continue to beconcerned about the auto industry. On the one hand, I watch thepricing behavior, as Governor Heller indicated; but also, I reallythink that the fundamentals of the auto sales picture are weaker thanthe dealer delivery figures may suggest. There was a surge at the endof 1986, and I think much of that surge should be attributed to thetax changes that were going into effect January 1. We know that therewas a substantial decline in January. But, as someone pointed out tome, even that overstated the strength of true retail demand because-24-2/10-11/87many fleet sales were processed in January. And, of course, that'snot a function of showroom traffic, and so forth; that is a deal thatis struck between large purchasers and the corporations. So, thefundamental demand for automobiles is probably even weaker than itlooks. Auto manufacturers are watching February numbers very, verycarefully. One person told me that they were inthe process of revising down their production schedules as we spoke,which was this morning. Anyway, I don't think that they are going tocontinue to wait for a miracle to occur that will somehow or othereliminate these high inventories, particularly in certain lines andcertain makes, is the company with the worst inventorysituation. They have excessive--that's my word, not theirs--andextensive incentives out right now. If they don't get the resultsthey expect--and there is a great deal of concern that they won't--then they will have to make really substantial production cuts. Ihope that isn't the case, but I am concerned that we may not have[forecast] enough weakness coming from that particular sector.The other area of my concern involves the trade turnaround.I asked at the [Board staff] briefing on Monday where the additionalexports in this country were going to go and what the products wouldbe. I also asked what imports were going to be curbed or curtailed,and I haven't gotten very good answers to those questions. I justthink it's going to be much more difficult to accomplish this. Thedeterioration, I would remind people, went on for a number of years--five or something like that. And I think that there have beenadjustments made in the economy to these changes and that they are notgoing to be easily reversed. Although I would like to see a quick andsubstantial turn, my suspicious nature suggests that it won't takeplace. So, I put those two differences together, and that's why Ithink that we are going to have a slower rate of growth.On the inflation side, I am just a touch more optimistic,perhaps, that we will be able to keep inflation under control. Here Iguess my main difference comes from what I view as a real change inbusiness behavior--not in all business behavior but in the behavior ofa number of significant businesses--in that they are finallyaddressing the efficiency question. They are really trying to skinnydown. I just heard of one request by an organization that is workingwith its suppliers over a five-year time horizon and telling them thatin order to be assured of business in this period ahead, they willhave to agree to cut their prices, not increase them, by one percentper year over the next five years. That's pretty hard bargaining.And I think a lot of things like that are going on that have mainlyresulted from the intense import competition. I think it has been a[unintelligible] factor. I certainly can't put an exact number on it;I don't pretend to know. But I think that that kind of behavior isgoing to help us keep these inflation numbers looking better than theyotherwise would", "-25-2/10-11/87MR. GUFFEY. Well, I think that since I am about the last[speaker], I will say something. Our forecast is very much like theBoard staff's on the growth side; we are a touch higher on theinflation side. If one were to make a forecast from the TenthDistrict perspective, none of those figures would be verysatisfactory; they would be much more pessimistic. On the forecastitself, the growth is largely dependent, as everybody has alreadynoted, upon the turnaround in the net export sector. If that occurs,then growth much as we experienced in 1986 seems to me to be quitereasonable. On the other hand, on the price side it seems to me thatour foreign competitors' import prices will have to rise since theirprofit margins have been squeezed over the last year and a half as thedollar has declined vis-a-vis their currencies. And that should startto show through together with an increase in imported oil prices. Ifthat were to occur, and as that is passed through, it would seem to methat inflation would be a bit higher than we experienced last year.Having said that, I think it is noteworthy, as Governor Hellermentioned, that the CPI--which will incorporate those higher importprices--quite likely will be in the 4 to 5 percent range. And it'sgoing to take some explanation, I guess by the Chairman, of thecontrast between the slow CPI numbers posted in 1986 with what likelywill happen in 1987 and why this may not be all that significant--whyit looks very high and should [not] give us all cause for concern", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I agree with you. I am willing to explainsomething about the forecast--up to 3.9 percent. When it gets above 4percent, it may get a little difficult to explain", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Just remember what you did to themthe last time you were there", " Afew people may find that their deductions--MR. MORRIS. I have looked in two [publications] that saidexactly the opposite", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we probably ought to turn to M2and M3 first and see whether we can resolve those. But I have onequestion, just to isolate it, on M1. If I understand correctly,you're saying it's a matter of judgment but, for what it's worth,you're reluctant to say that growth would be less than 10 percent forM1; however, the model shows half of that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You just don't believe your models", "MR. KOHN. That's correct. Some of these models showed ratesonly a little above that for 1986. Others were closer to the mark butimplied such a marked slowdown, especially in the OCD component, thatI have trouble believing them", " You have to put in a set of interest rateassumptions to make it--MR. KOHN. No, these model results are based on the interestrate assumptions behind the Greenbook forecast--that is, essentiallyvery little changed", "MR. ANGELL. I prefer alternative II also. It would seem tome that the accommodation of 1986 is not as apt to occur; so 8-1/2percent, even under a declining velocity scenario, does give us anequal opportunity to snug up a bit. But I do think, as we proceedwith alternative II, that this year we should be aware of the factthat market forces are even more important. That is, if long-termbond rates and intermediate bond rates were to rise, it seems to methat, given the problem with the dollar, we ought to be particularlysensitive to those interest rates--on the down side also. I wantalternative II with a proviso that interest rates ought not to bemanaged by the Fed much differently than the market forces wouldindicate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal", "MR. PARRY. And M3 at 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent. Some of thework that we've done would support that and--maybe Don can comment onthis--I think some of the quantitative work the Board staff has donesuggests that M2 would grow in the low end of the range", "MR. KOHN. Actually, that was our judgment given what weexpect for bank and thrift credit growth, which tends to drive M3because of the managed liability component; we expect that todecelerate substantially. We had M3 at 7 percent or a tick below,between 6-1/2 and 7 percent. M2 at 7 percent was judgmental. Mr.Parry is absolutely right in the sense that our quarterly model, as Itried to indicate in the briefing, was showing something on the orderof 6 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 growth, which is in the lower end of therange. I think his model is showing more like 5 to 5-1/2 percent", "MR. MORRIS. The last one", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin", " We expect to see--MR. BLACK. All guides are unreliable; some are just moreunreliable than others", "-33-2/10-11/87CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I have great doubts about that. Mr.Morris, we'll let you talk", "MR. MELZER. Basically, I like this language or the conceptof it. I might just suggest an extension to what you've suggested.What you have suggested makes a lot of sense. In general, I have someproblem with the signaling effect of abandoning a narrow aggregatealtogether. As I said at the last meeting, I'm not sure that we havethe right one in M1 as it is now. Also, I'm not sure that we canreally pick another right one right now. I think we have to let thisunwinding of inflationary expectations that's been in process sort ofrun its course. I don't think any of us is confident that it has donethat, so I don't think it's a good time to pick another narrowaggregate. Roger Guffey commented before, and I agree with him, thatwhat we do with respect to M2 and M3 doesn't have much of a signalingeffect at all. I'm afraid that not setting any target at all for M1could potentially have a negative signaling effect. And as you'veobserved, Mr. Chairman, it could have a negative effect on Mr.Proxmire. I would suggest that we consider setting a target along thelines of what Don suggested based on what we know now. We could set atarget range for M1 of, say, 7 to 13 percent, but with languagesurrounding it indicating that we might miss that on the up side orthe down side. Now, when I thought about this, I was concerned aboutwhat the implications of that might be. But if we add to that thekind of language that's in variant I with respect to missing thatsubstantially on the down side--and also recognize that we've got toapproach this target flexibly and we ought to be prepared to changeit--I think that there's some advantage to having the target outthere. As I said, not having a narrower aggregate--which is what wecan really exert some control over based on our behavior and what wedo with reserves--could send a negative signal. What you'resuggesting could potentially be misread in the other direction aswell. The 7 to 13 percent range certainly puts out a clear message in-36-2/10-11/87the market that we expect the very rapid growth rates in money thathave occurred in the last two years to come down.

JOHNSON. We might see a rush out of liquid balances--ifthere's an interest sensitivity there--into CDs fairly quickly; Idon't know.

Why don't we just say: \"Withrespect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on experience, thebehavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of otherevidence with respect to economic activity and prices; fluctuations inM1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes ininterest rates, among other factors. During 1987 the Committeeanticipates that growth in M1 should slow. However, in the light ofits sensitivity to a variety of influences, the Committee decided notto establish a precise target for its growth over the year as a wholeat this time. Instead, the appropriateness of changes in M1 duringthe course of the year will be evaluated in the light of the behaviorof its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets,and the nature of emerging price pressures.\" If I can make aneditorial comment, I wrote this \"the nature of emerging pricepressures\" rather than \"emerging price pressures\" because we allconcede that there are likely to be some emerging price pressures thatwe have already taken into account. \"In that connection, theCommittee believes that, particularly in the light of theextraordinary expansion of this aggregate in recent years, much slowermonetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuingeconomic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying pricepressures, perhaps related to significant weakness of the dollar inexchange markets, and relatively strong growth in the broad monetaryaggregates. Conversely, continuing sizable increases in M1 could beaccommodated in circumstances surrounded by sluggish businessactivity, maintenance of progress toward underlying price stability,and progress toward international equilibrium.

Inventory investment isclearly an important component of your forecast, especially in thefirst quarter of this year. One thing that struck me in terms of yourforecast is the forecast of negative changes in farming inventoriesover a 9-quarter period which is clearly unprecedented in the postwarperiod. I wonder what you had in mind in assuming decumulation in thefarm sector over that length of time", "MR. GUFFEY.

If you look at services, particularly beginning in thesecond quarter of 1987, growth rates spend most of their time,actually, at less than 1-1/2 percent.

Secularly, growth ofservice expenditures is probably more in the range of 3 percent plus.I think on a cyclical basis we have seen it for a couple of quarters,but nothing like this", "MR. JOHNSON. That raises a point that I was asking aboutyesterday; I still haven't cleared it up quite in my head. I got ananswer, but I can't repeat it. The staff's forecast for growth abroadwas revised down by a significant amount, yet our GNP numbers haven'treally changed. I need a review of how we would make that up", " We have gotten a lot of themovement actually [earlier] in the period, so that has had a slightoffsetting effect on--MR. JOHNSON. But is that helping us on the trade side anymore", "MR. JOHNSON. But you would expect some upward pressure", "MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, discussions with our directors andothers in business in the Twelfth District indicate that businessconditions are improving to some extent. There clearly areexceptions, and the two that I would note would be Alaska and thecentral valley of California. However, California's total employmenthas been quite strong. California's employment represents 60 percentof the District and it surged in February, pushing the District'sunemployment rate below the national average. Some fragmentary datathat we have on retail sales for the beginning of the year indicatethat the fall-off that was so pronounced at the national level inJanuary was not shared by the Twelfth District. Also, data that wehave on trade from the Pacific Coast ports provide some evidence ofimprovement in our net export position, as the trade deficit hasnarrowed significantly in the past 12 months.Turning to the national economy, our forecast indicates asomewhat worse trade-off between growth in output and inflation thanis incorporated in the Greenbook. We have slightly less growth in1987 and 1988 and inflation--at least in our forecast for 1987--is 1/2percentage point higher. We have a similar inflation outlook for 1988because we agree with the Greenbook that we are likely to see upwardinflationary pressures arising from import prices persisting throughall of next year. However, in contrast to the Greenbook, we expectthese inflationary pressures to emerge as early as the second half ofthis year. Thus, we see a period of upward pressure on nominal short-term interest rates beginning soon and probably extending into thesecond half of 1988. In my view, it will be necessary to allownominal interest rates to rise; if we don't, short-term real rates maybe pushed too low. We also are looking for somewhat stronger growthtoward year-end 1987 than the Board staff, as we have slightly higherconsumption and, of course, the trade account begins to improve atthat point. Thus, we believe that it may be appropriate to allow realinterest rates to nudge up toward year-end. In our view, it would bea bit too risky to allow the pickup in demand pressures to the pointwhere the temporary price shocks become a factor in longer-term-18-3/31/87inflationary expectations. In our view, the gap between actual andpotential [GNP] is really pretty small. Some estimates that we ransuggest it's on the order of one percentage point. Therefore,available slack in the economy is also small, and we think thatinflationary risks at the present time are fairly significant", "MR. KEEHN. While the conditions in our District are largelyunchanged from previous periods, at least in the fundamental sense, Ido have a feeling that there is a better tone out there. It isentirely possible that this has been affected by the winter. Wereally have had exceptionally mild weather this winter and, as aconsequence, anything that would normally be adversely affected by theweather is doing very well. Construction is the very obvious example.Home building is strong. Jim Kichline has commented on that, but inthe Midwest in January and February home starts were up something like40 percent over the previous year--obviously very heavily weather-affected. Commercial office building continues to be, I think,astoundingly active. There are a number of new buildings that areplanned; despite a creeping up in the vacancy rate there are morebuildings going up. As a consequence of all this, all the buildingmaterials people--cement, masonry, and the like--are doing reallyexceptionally well. There do continue to be plant closings, but Ithink they are slowing down a bit and there is some offsetting goodnews. Last week, or maybe earlier this week, Youngstown and Nipponannounced a very sizable joint venture--a $400 million coal powerplant. That is the first significant development in the steelindustry like that for quite some while. Employment in the Districtis also a bit on the positive side. In January our employmentincreased by the national average; that is the first time we have hadthat in some while.Even the farm sector looks a little better or, at least,maybe not worse. Farm earnings are probably going to increase thisyear; that does not really reflect a fundamental change but rather thehuge government subsidies. I will say, though, that the livestockbusiness has been and continues to be pretty good. There is someimprovement or expectation of improvement with regard to corn exports,offset a bit by lower soybean exports. We think land values are--we've been saying this for a while but we have a growing confidence--in a zone of stability that ought to be helpful to the banks. If thatdoes occur, we have a hope that the whole farm sector may be at a zoneof stability, if you will, albeit at a very low level, as it has beenfor quite some while. There is renewed concern out there about theFarm Credit System; but despite that concern there is, I think, theabsolute expectation that at the end of the day the Government isgoing to be there and provide support for that. But certainly, thathas put an air of uncertainty into it all.On the trade picture, we would have somewhat of adisagreement with the staff forecast. We have commented already onit, perhaps, but the people I talked to are not experiencing theimprovements in exports that the Greenbook would suggest. They areconcerned about weak conditions in foreign markets and, therefore, theopportunity for their products. But on the import side, there isvery, very broad agreement that we've got some improvement. Thecompanies that are manufacturing products for the domestic markets are-19-3/31/87finding a better receptivity there, a little less out-sourcing, and anincrease in domestic production. And that is certainly animprovement. With regard to the exchange rates, just a specificcomment: told us that the increase in thedeutschemark has basically priced German equipment that is used in thepaper industry out of the market for the first time in quite somewhile, noted that in the machine tool industry, U.S.labor rates are now lower than is the case in Japan. That is also avery significant change for that industry.On inflation, I think the picture is a bit mixed. The laborsituation continues to be good. The people I talked to aboutcontracts are continuing to get what they think are very favorabledeals--some as low as 1 or 1-1/3 percent. Generally, most of themwere under 3 percent with pretty good work rule changes resulting inproductivity improvements. Pricing on other commodities andmaterials, everybody says, is fiercely competitive--that they can'traise prices, etc., etc. But I am hearing of more instances of the 3to 4 percent increase and occasionally the 5 percent, so I think thereis a bit of an upward movement on that. In a specific industry, thepaper industry,a broad upward trend in [theprices of] the commodities that they use, and most specificallypolystyrene resin. I think there is a special reason for this, butthey have had a price increase on that of about 30 percent in the lastyear.In some ways we certainly are in very close agreement withthe staff forecast; we see no recession or a strong break-out on theup side either. We are a little apprehensive that the export side maynot be quite as strong as we expect. On the inflation side we seenothing yet to be alarmed about but are beginning to sense some upwardpressure out there. It is not pervasive yet but I think it is thearea that we want to watch", "MR. STERN. I have been impressed for some time at theongoing employment gains at the national level. It seems to me thatrather healthy employment gains have been underway for roughly sixmonths or so now, going back to September. I must say that that kindof improvement seems to be evident, at least anecdotally, in many ofthe comments I hear around the District extending over roughly thesame period of time. But it is not mirrored in many of the othernational statistics that I look at, although maybe if one lookscarefully at some of the consumer spending data, excluding autos, orsome of the construction data, one can see some of it in there. Iconclude from that divergence between what I am hearing anecdotally inthe District on the employment gains versus some of the otherstatistics that the recovery remains uneven and unbalanced. But Ialso wonder if it isn't a fact that a lot of our statistics don'tfocus on services and trade, and finance, insurance, and real estate,and so forth, where a lot of this activity, in fact, lies.On the inflation side, I have been expecting, of course, thatwe would see some deterioration this year in any event, and I haven'tchanged my views about that. I would report that in talking to somepeople in the District, in two very different kinds of businesses--pulp paper, lumber, etc. and in health care which is a small butstubborn component in the CPI--prices, at least in general, have beenrising more rapidly once again. There seem to be growing indications-24-3/31/87of some rebuilding of price pressures, at least in those two sectorsout our way. Despite what I would consider my basic satisfaction withthe immediate economic outlook and conditions in the District, I mustsay that, if anything, I am less optimistic about the longer term. Itseems to me that some people have touched on this. Many of the thingsthat we have talked about over the last several years that might gowrong seem to be in the process of going wrong at the moment, as Iview it. The dollar has been touched on: what that means for Germanyand Japan and what that means for domestic inflation. All thosethings are not looking good. Protectionism adds to those concerns.The LDC situation looks to me to be worse. Probably I could add tothat litany if I really tried. But I guess my message is that as Ilook at that and what it might imply for economic performance here andabroad I am, if anything, more concerned", "MR. BLACK. At the time of our February meeting we hadslightly higher projections on real GNP and inflation than the Board-25-3/31/87staff had. The staff has not changed its overall projection, althoughit has changed the shape or the profile, and we left ours pretty muchthe same--partly out of conviction and also probably because we knewif we made another forecast that we would have two errors rather thanone. The main point of difference that we have with the staff is inthe area of residential construction. We think, given the sharp dropthat we have had in mortgage rates, that it ought to be a littlestronger than 1.3 percent. Even more important than that, the staff'sdownward revision in construction and personal consumptionexpenditures, to which several people have alluded, is prettysignificant. It has come down from 4 percent in 1986 to 1 percent in1987 and we have not had that low a rate of growth since 1981, whichwas a recession year. In view of the proliferation of home equitymortgage loans--which I would think would make a difference--and alsothe wealth effect of the stock market, we think that that's apt to bea little stronger. We come out about the same on the net exports ofgoods and services, although I think that is probably the mostvulnerable part of all of our forecasts. Things don't look all thatgood abroad now but we would stick with about what the Board's staffhas said.As I mentioned, in the area of inflation we are a littlehigher than the Board staff. Although we are still predicting afairly moderate inflation in the implicit price deflator for nextyear, I think this price level bears some closer monitoring. There isa lot of money and liquidity out there and that is going to be felt atsome time. We have had a substantial depreciation of the dollar andthere has been an increase in capacity utilization, and all thesethings ought to work to put some upward pressure on the dollar at somepoint. It may come a little sooner than most people seem to think.Some of the pickup in industrial prices, as shown in the Greenbook andalso reported in several of the District surveys contained in theBeige book, suggest that there may be a little more there than meetsthe eye. I hope not, but it is something that I think bears somewatching for the time being", "MR. ANGELL. There does seem to be a growing consensus aboutthe world economy, so I don't think I need to elaborate much more onlow world economic growth rates. That's certainly not good news, asall of us know, in regard to the LDC's debt and to many other thingsthat are very important to us. Unfortunately, in the news on the U.S.economy it is hard to see any bright spots, because if we do get anyrebound--and if it is rather significant--in view of the world economythat may very well overwhelm the exchange rate effects. So we wouldend up having a bad world even if we meet U.S. growth projections. Sothat is somewhat of a negative.I tend to be sympathetic with the staff's view on theinflation rate because I think a global perspective is very, verysignificant. I noted here today that I haven't yet heard a presidentof a Reserve Bank who has come in with an inflation rate that is lowerthan staff's. I hear a lot that are higher. I am about up to thestaff's level now on inflation because there has been a development in-27-3/31/87regard to the spring storms that might have an adverse effect on foodprices. That is, this blizzard in the Midwest occurred at a ratherunfortunate time with regard to calving and there is a lot oflivestock damage--anecdotal at this point. We don't know what thenumbers are but the situation could be somewhat severe. I guess thereis some benefit in that we have moved a lot of that cow/calf operationto Florida and that works pretty well for reasons I have not quiteunderstood. You feed cattle, or start them off, on a very poor grassdiet--I am not trying to draw aspersions to Florida--but then youtransfer them to the good blue foothills grass and you get marvelouskinds of changes. So we don't have as much of the cattle exposed aswe did before, but that undoubtedly would have an adverse impact.I would second what has been mentioned about agriculture. Weare now beginning to see farmers who are having prosperity andranchers who are having prosperity come forward. For quite a whilefarmers who were making any money tended to be very quiet about it inthis kind of environment, but they're beginning to come forward. Itdoes appear that most of the land purchases are being made by farmers,not by out-of-farming interests. It may very well be that ouragricultural banks are going to get through this year to a periodwhere in 1988 we may have some better news. I wish we could say thesame thing about banks with LDC debt", "MR. JOHNSON. I think just about everything has been covered.For my own benefit, I'll summarize my thoughts a bit. I have heardfrom a lot of the Districts that things look better. Production ispicking up and employment looks a little better in the trade-relatedarea and in some manufacturing. I think the aggregate statisticsreflect some of that and that is encouraging. What concerns me alittle is how much of this production that we are seeing is going intoinventories. How much of it is really meeting domestic consumption.There seems to be some circumstantial evidence of some involuntaryinventory buildup. It is more in the automobile area than anywhereelse, but there are at least some signs of inventory pressure even inthe non-auto area. That may be just the rebuilding of stocks to morenormal levels but given the low forecast that we have for domesticdemand--which a lot of comments reflected around the room--you justwonder if all that production and greater optimism we are seeing aregoing to be permanent or if there will be a flash into inventories.If so, there is some risk and a little concern as to whether thisproduction activity is going to be continuing. That bothers me alittle, especially when we are marking down growth abroad and thepotential for our export markets. So, we may not be seeing thestrength in the future from the export side that we had been expectingearlier.That is somewhat of a problem which brings me to the dilemmathat I keep worrying about. I think we all agree that the dollar isat levels where we wouldn't like to see it go particularly lower.Having it go lower would make it counterproductive on the trade sideas well as the inflation side at this point. But I think the concernis: should we get dragged down by trying to stabilize the dollaragainst some countries who are experiencing economic decline. I worrya bit about the overall macroeconomic effects of trying to stabilizethe dollar against some weakening economy. At the same time I am at a3/31/87loss for knowing what to do about it simply because I think there is arisk to our financial market stability, especially in the short run--and maybe even for inflation in the long run--if we don't try and dosomething about the dollar. It is a real predicament that we have todeal with and the protectionist sentiment that we are seeing surfaceis part of that problem now. I just hope we don't have to get into asituation where we are defending the dollar because of a confidenceproblem associated with destabilizing exchange rates againstcurrencies whose countries are showing continued decline. That is areal risk; in my mind that seems to be the major problem and I justdon't know exactly how we should deal with it", "MS. SEGER. My own forecast is a little below the staff'sforecast, at least in terms of the overall growth for the economy. Ingoing back to the time when the staff first presented its forecast for1987, I have had this concern--which I have heard here at least seventimes already today--about the ability of the trade picture to improveenough to make the contribution to our overall growth situation thatwe seem to have expected and we continue to expect. Also, I must saythat I am still not convinced, even with exchange rate adjustments andeven with more American businessmen interested in exporting, that wein fact can do a lot more exporting--because of not necessarily havingthe kinds of products, or enough of the kinds of products, that arewanted in other parts of the world. I have been lectured on thismatter by some Germans over the last couple of weeks or months, so Ihope they haven't unduly colored my view. But I think there is someof that going on. Also, I am not convinced that all the markets inthe world are really open to our products; I think the events of thelast few days have suggested that some other people have wondered, atleast, whether the Japanese markets were open to our products. So,that concerns me.On the domestic side my nagging concern continues to be theauto industry. They already have very substantial supplies of newcars sitting in various dealer lots and showrooms. There have beensome cuts in production and there have been some downward revisions ofproduction schedules. But my woman's intuition suggests that maybescheduling changes have not gone far enough and that we will see moreof them. Therefore, I hope that the staff's forecast does prove to beright because I do want a good healthy economy, and I like fastergrowth rates rather than slower growth rates. But I really think weare putting a lot of our eggs in one or two baskets and I just hope wedon't stub our toes", "MR. JOHNSON. I think they are too high if interest ratespick up", " Well, there's no number like that in theBluebook but it seems to me that a 3 to 7 range gives the path for thedollar--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. You just made that up, I guess", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I think the economy is strongenough that there's certainly no case for pursuing an easier policyeven if the aggregates should come in for the next month or so belowthe projections indicated. I'd like to call your attention, though,to the fact that we've already had some tightening in the last fewdays. We've had the long-term government bond yield go up about 30basis points. If that should stick, we should expect to see a similarrise in corporate bond and mortgage rates. As far as moving to ahigher borrowing level and a tighter policy, I think that depends alot on the nature of the overall circumstances. I'm inclined to takethe same position that Governor Heller did: that with the worldeconomy growing so slowly, if we're going to stay on a path ofimproving our balance of payments position we've got to be able toincrease our market share in a world that's not growing very fast.And I'm not sure we can do that at the present level of the exchangerate. I don't know where the equilibrium rate is but I suspect thedollar has to come down somewhat further before we get enough momentumgoing to begin to restore our balance of payments position. So itseems to me that if we're going to raise the borrowing level we oughtto have a conference call so that the members of the Committee reallycan appraise the situation in the light of what's going ondomestically as well as what's going on in the foreign exchangemarket. If we're getting a modest, gradual, downward drift in thedollar I don't think we ought to be concerned about that. If we get asustained number of days [of weakness], as we've had recently, ofcourse, that's another matter. It depends on the conditions, and Ithink they're kind of hard to describe in advance. That's why Isuggest that we should have a conference call", "MR. STERN. Given all the current and prospective problems weface, I favor alternative B in terms of a borrowing target, at leastas the starting point. I think we should not roil things here anyfurther unnecessarily. I would maintain the kind of asymmetry that'sin the directive and I would be in favor of greater emphasis onforeign exchange market considerations. As Jerry Corrigan mentionedearlier, in the period ahead we may be in a situation whereintervention alone doesn't do it; we may have to be prepared to backthat up with something more meaningful. Beyond that, I would add thatI don't know what the right level for the dollar is, but I amconcerned that a lower dollar as a consequence of accommodativemonetary policy at this point will not solve our trade problem in anysustained or any satisfactory way. It seems to me that in the longerrun that's going to produce either higher inflation or weaker domesticinvestment than we would like to see, or some combination of both overtime. I'm quite concerned about that; that is a longer-term matter.I think we have to be very careful with the dollar here and I don'tknow that having it go lower at this juncture, as a consequence ofmonetary policy, is a helpful development at all", "MR. JOHNSON. I agree with the statements that where theeconomy is headed is a little uncertain now. So I don't think that wewant to make any clear-cut moves in monetary policy. That's why Isupport something like alternative B. But I am concerned about someof the potential destabilizing activities that are going on in thefinancial markets. So, even though I really wouldn't want a change inpolicy, I think that it may be necessary to at least reserve somepotential discretion--or maybe the answer is to have the potential fora conference call--to deal with a situation that might require someuptick in the borrowing level. I would reemphasize what I saidbefore: that my preference would be not to do anything like that, orat least to make our best effort to convince our trading partners whohave these large surpluses to be less reluctant on their own domesticpolicy. That's where I think the real problem lies more than it lieshere. I'd hate to see us dragged into their scenario by trying todefend the dollar when it's sinking against those currencies. Andthat is a real risk. But I think we have to deal with thedestabilizing market activity. There is a real threat of inflationaryexpectations surfacing if we let it get out of hand. So there mightbe room for some discretion. I'm not sure whether having thediscretion to run the borrowings up to a certain level is the rightapproach. We recently had some trouble figuring out what therelationship between borrowings and the interest rate spread is. So,if we were to say something like a $500 million borrowing target, I'mnot sure what funds rate would be necessary to produce that. We mightwant to think more in terms of just adjusting the funds rate a littlerather than trying to hit some borrowing level when we're not surewhat funds rate it requires. I don't know what that means exactly--maybe a conference call or some sort of consultation. The problem isthat the developments that surface require quick action and I'm notsure there's always the time to sit around and have a conference callabout it. Maybe there's some room for some discretionary allowancethere. I think we ought to at least give this upcoming G-10 meeting achance", "MS. SEGER. You'd have to pay along the way, too. Right", "MR. HELLER. Let me speak against that a bit. If we start totighten up now and are unsuccessful at holding the dollar where it isat the present time, I think we will not see any improvement in thetrade and current account balances, especially in view of thesituation abroad. Then as the bad data continue to come in on thetrade front, the markets will say: Well, the current level is clearlyinappropriate for the exchange rate. They will test us, and we willnot be able to sustain the current exchange rate. So I think it isprobably more prudent to let the exchange rate drift down a littleuntil it is at a level where we can see an improvement in the currentaccount and the trade account. Then if you spend your ammunition youhave a chance to convince the markets that you will hold it", " But, Bob, the time--MR. PARRY. Bob, but the question is: What's going to takeyou there. The question is whether or not you're going to needsomewhat higher interest rates to get that smooth movement. I thinkthe interest rates that Jerry and others are talking about do notinvolve doing something to preserve the rate as it exists today-40-3/31/87necessarily, but to provide a more orderly movement. And I think thatlinkage is key", "MR. HELLER. Well, okay.

We havesomebody else's, which was \"around 6 percent.\" There is a substantivedifference between those two", "MR. KEEHN. Just a thought: Does putting in a range now of,say, 3 to 7 percent, which is lower than the annual range of 5-1/2 to8-1/2 percent, condition it with regard to time. Might that suggestto somebody that we're easing up on policy here. Would putting in alower range than we have established for the year suggest that we aresneaking up on a policy change", "MR. ANGELL. Then there is a substantial difference ofopinion here, because in the environment of a weakening dollar and thecommodity price effects that are associated with such a weakeningdollar, I really do not want to go above, say, 7 percent. I reallywould want to tighten in that environment. So I think there is somepolicy difference that's cropping up", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.

That is technically correct, but itattaches such precision to these estimates that are never that good", "MR. ANGELL. The only reason I don't want reserve restraintright now is because it seems to me that we've got a very low moneygrowth path right now.

JOHNSON. But that's not what the staff is projecting", "MR. JOHNSON. That's not true. That's not what the staffsays.

For the Germans on the fiscal side, I thinksome of them, including some people at the Bundesbank, are quiteworried about the business outlook.

If you look at the GNP deflator or the GNPfixed-weighted index you have the persistent effect of net exportsbeing subtracted, which tends to depress those GNP measures. If youlook at private domestic final purchases prices, the PCE fixed-weightmeasure or deflator picks up very directly all of these import pricesthat we're talking about rising at double-digit rates. So you'reright: we have prices for personal consumption expenditures risingeven in excess of 4 percent--4-1/4 to nearly 5 percent in 1988. Andthat has the effect in this forecast of depressing real income growth.So you have it right in the sense of why we believe we will be facinga fairly weak picture on domestic consumption.

This is, in part, the arithmetic. Januaryjust plunged and plunged partly because included in businessinvestment would be auto and light truck purchases. So part of thearithmetic is that as February and March came back, orders sort offlattened out. We know auto sales were rising a bit, and so for thesecond quarter, instead of the 13 percent drop recorded in the firstquarter, we have a pickup in real terms to something like 6-1/4percent. In part that's arithmetic; in part that's a pickup in autosales. But I think one ought to read through that; and when we readthrough it we have essentially unchanged business spending for theyear in real terms. I think that's a more accurate picture", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You can insert a question", "MR. KICHLINE. I don't think you're going to get one noweither. It is curious that we are seeing what is really a fairlysluggish industrial sector, particularly for the last couple ofmonths. We can explain the autos and trucks, and that's the bulk ofthe decline. But in the detail in the industrial production index, asI noted yesterday, in many of the sectors where we thought we'd seesome rise because of export orders growing nothing is happening.There have been really widespread weaknesses for two months. We havesome difficulty reconciling that, obviously, with total payrollemployment, which gives the picture of a lot of spending. Virtuallyall of that is in the trade and services areas; it's not reallyspilling over into manufacturing. One of the concerns in the forecastis that we have built in, frankly even for the current quarter,increases of 0.3 to 0.4 percent in industrial production in May andJune, which we think needs to occur to rationalize what has beenhappening. We have a month or two divergence between these varioussignals", " That could occur in the services area and Iwouldn't--MR. JOHNSON. Yes, I know; there's no doubt about that. Butgiven the way the forecast is shaped, we've got a situation where5/19/87there is low growth in the services area, which you alreadyacknowledged, Bob, and a shift to trade-related, industrial-related,types of functions. It's not showing up in the numbers even though weare feeling better about it. Bob has just said he's feeling betterabout it, and I'm feeling better about it. It's just not in thenumbers. And if there is going to be that re-composition, one wouldexpect to see it in industrial production", "MS. SEGER. The autos don't have [a] capacity [problem]", "MR. KICHLINE. Let me note that the 0.4 and 0.3 percent--pickwhichever month you want that in--but we're stuck with minus 0.4percent in April. On a quarterly average basis, that pickup will givezero growth in industrial output in the second quarter. We have 2-1/2percent growth at an annual rate in the first quarter, but we need apickup even to get zero, given that we are starting out at a lownumber", "MR. PARRY. Is that excluding autos", " It's still down; everything--MR. KICHLINE. Autos and trucks, for example, were worthalmost 3/10ths of the 4/10ths decline, so 2/3 to 3/4 of the depressingfactor came out of the motor vehicles sector. President Morris, youasked about the workweek. You're quite correct: the numbers in theworkweek were depressed because there were religious holidays duringthat week. For manufacturing production hours, they're down somethinglike 1 percent. Looking at the path over the last 20 years, in thefew years in which this has occurred virtually 3/5ths to 2/3rds ofthat is alleged by our folks who do this to have been accounted for bythe effect of the holidays. So, a lot of that has been discounted inputting together the industrial production data", "MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, basically, I agree with the staff'sforecast of real GNP for this year and next. The growth rates of 3percent and 2-1/2 percent, respectively, certainly seem reasonable tome. I also would agree that the primary source of strength is likelyto be an improved net export position. However, as would be indicatedfrom some of our discussion, I would expect the improvement in thisarea to be somewhat less and the strength of consumption, particularlythat of services, to be slightly greater. In the inflation area, Ithink a good case can be made for a 4 to 4-1/2 percent rate ofinflation in the remaining quarters of this year, as compared to thestaff's forecast of a gradual decline to a 3.2 percent rate in thefourth quarter of 1987. We have seen a large increase in the realprice of oil, which could have significant effects on the inflationrate during the rest of this year. I think it's generally agreed--certainly in our forecast and the staff's forecast--that prices ofnon-oil imports are going to continue to rise in an area in excess of10 percent. Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate, Ibelieve, takes us into the range of full employment of laborresources. And, finally, inflationary expectations seem to be moreserious, judging from financial market developments for the last sixweeks. As far as 1988's inflation rate is concerned, there is quite apickup in the staff's forecast of the inflation rate. And I think thefactors that I mentioned are likely to cause that to occur", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I can be relatively brief. I amabout where Mr. Boehne was an hour ago. As a matter of fact, Mr.Boehne captured my assessment rather well. I think there are risks inthe real economy, here and abroad, but basically the way things haveunfolded so far this year is pretty much in line both with what wasexpected and, indeed, with what I think constitutes a fairlysatisfactory performance, given where we are. I do think that therehas been a change in the past six weeks on the inflation front, and Ithink it goes well beyond Wall Street. I think six, eight, ten weeks-19-5/19/87ago, there was a whiff of inflation--that was the phrase--and that mayhave been more concentrated on Wall Street. But at this point I thinkthere is more to it than that. Si Keehn's comment puts it in verygood perspective. If you have a sector of the economy where you hadprice decreases and now you have small increases, and everything elsestays the same elsewhere in the economy, the cumulative weight on theinflation side is obviously greater. As I look at the indices, Icertainly would agree that some of the forces working in the directionof higher measured rates of inflation were predictable--energy prices,and to some extent, agricultural prices, and certainly import prices.But even if they were predictable, it seems to me one of two things,or both, may be operative: first, that the amounts of those increasesmay be larger than most people thought they were going to be; andsecond--I am by no means saying that--that there isn't any such thingas one-time price increases. I think there is a tendency for thesethings to cumulate. So, whether it's in terms of forecasts--and notWall Street forecasts, but forecasts from any number of sources aroundthe country--or what is in the actual statistics themselves, I comeaway with the view that either actual or forecast rates of inflationhave stepped up by something in the area of a half point and maybeeven as much as a point. We are looking now at consumer priceincreases, excluding food and energy, probably on the up side of 4-1/2percent. It doesn't take a lot to get to 5 percent; and once you getto 5 percent, I think the argument that it will wash out becomes thatmuch more questionable. So, I think there is a change on theinflation side", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We seem to have disagreements about somefacts and analysis. What is going on in the consumer price indexoutside food and energy, Mr. Kichline", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Those are not real numbers. Practicallynone of the trade imbalance would be eliminated in nominal terms", "MR. JOHNSON. I must admit I am a little torn between whichway things are going. I don't have a clear view myself. Obviously,the financial markets are indicating some inflationary expectations.The question is--and it has certainly been the question here--whetherwe think they will be realized or not and whether we want to betagainst the markets or whether we think something more needs to bedone or has already been done.In terms of the Greenbook forecast, I agree with a lot of itexcept that one of the major factors feeding into the projection ofrising inflation in 1988 in this forecast is further expectation of aweakening dollar. Of course, that feeds right into import prices; soin the forecast you don't have a one-time adjustment in import pricesthat washes out over time. You have a continuous feed-through of adecline in the exchange rate that is causing continued upward pressureon the inflation rate. Now, if I really thought that was going to bethe case, I would be a lot more concerned. It may be possible, so Ithink that we need to concern ourselves with stabilizing the dollar atsome point. If I thought the dollar was going to deteriorate on acontinuing basis, I would have some concern about the continued upwardpressure on the inflation picture. So, I would hope that we couldachieve some conditions that would stabilize the dollar without acontinuing deteriorating trend. I think the question then is: Whatdoes it take to do that. We now see some growing spreads in interestdifferentials between the United States and our other tradingpartners. My own opinion is that, hopefully, we are getting to thepoint where the dollar is finding some legs under it and will have tostabilize. I think the real question is whether we have done or areabout to do enough in monetary policy to convince the markets that weare dealing with the inflationary risks in terms of the dollar andother domestic pressures on inflation. As Peter Sternlight pointedout, borrowings--inadvertently or advertently--averaged $700 millionover the last intermeeting period. I am not sure whether we want togo further than that or whether I personally want to continue thatsort of a borrowing assumption. So I think the question is: What doesit take to stabilize these conditions. I don't want to overreact anddeal with more than just what the inflationary risk is", " I think we could easilyhave offset that; it wouldn't have been--MR. BOYKIN. But we didn't start out there; we actuallystarted out with $300 million, leaning in favor of moving that updepending on what happened to the dollar", "MR. BOEHNE.

If we are doing it to getsome impact on the foreign exchange market, which still makes sense tome, I think an increase above a half point might attract a little moreattention.

CROSS. Well, I think it is still somewhat fragile. As Isaid, I think the market paid a great deal of attention to, and wasreassured considerably by, the willingness of the Federal Reserve tosnug because of the dollar. Looking ahead, it's not clear that themarket would feel that there will be the same kind of maneuverabilityor ability to untighten. I think, for the present, that we have quitea healthy sense of two-way risks in the market. But there is someskepticism; there are these feelings out there that some action willbe taken, either in intervention or another area, if the dollar movesup very far from its present level.

CROSS. There's no question that people are talking very,very intently about what these trade figures will be on the 15th ofJuly when they come out", "7/7/87MR. TRUMAN. I would say that April was somewhat over-interpreted--that is, as listed in the forecast. That [deficit]number on a balance-of-payments basis was something like [an annualrate of] $140 billion and we have a little over $150 billion for thequarter as a whole. We think that May and June will be not as good asApril, but not dramatically different in terms of the monthly figures.But to the extent that the market has been extrapolating the trend asthe numbers came down in February, March, and April, even a levelingoff [in the trade deficit] might produce some degree ofdisappointment", "MR. CROSS. We can't really tell very much about it, but whatwe hear is that it's still fragile. Even if one is buying a long-termbond, that's not a long-term investment. There is not a lot ofassurance that these present exchange rates are stable enough for oneto be entering into a lot of long-term investments with assurancesthat there are not going to be further changes. At least that is whata lot of people tell us", "MR. KOHN. A two-week average. There are also some longer-term shifts in that relationship. One was identified during theperiod of the Continental Illinois crisis, when banks obviously becamemore reluctant to use the discount window because they were concernedabout being seen as borrowing in that period. More recently, asmaller shift occurred last year when banks' desire to borrow alsoseemed to be less than might have been expected based on the long-termaverage.A second source of misses involves a deviation of actualborrowing from the borrowing that was intended, that is, the borrowinglevel that was put in the path. There we can have misses in excessreserves and estimates of excess and required reserves. Once again,the pattern of reserves provision and borrowing in the period can giverise to these sorts of misses. I think an important finding in thepaper is that there tend to be some offsets among the different kindsof errors that can be found in this relationship. So, the loosenessof a piece of the relationship--say, the relationship betweenborrowing and the funds rate spread--viewed by itself does not showthrough to the differences or the looseness between the actual fundsrate and the funds rate that was anticipated by the Desk. There areactions by the Desk in supplying reserves and by the market in keepingthe funds rate at levels that it believes consistent with the Deskprojection that tend to reduce quite substantially the standard errorsassociated with the difference between realized funds rates and fundsrates anticipated by the Desk. In the end, I think the relationshiplooks loose, but not all that loose. The current operatingprocedures, and the Desk and market actions that go with them, doprovide an anchor to the federal funds rate. But there is room formarket forces or for unanticipated misses in reserves to show throughin this relationship. Sometimes that can occur in desired ways: thatis, the market can push us toward higher or lower funds rates inanticipation of something we might end up doing; sometimes it couldmove the other way.With regard to the last intermeeting period, the problem wasprimarily the difference between the actual borrowing that occurredand the borrowing that was in the path. I think there were severalparticular problems that built on themselves in that period. One wasthe problem with the Treasury balance and the tax payments, which bothbuilt up the required reserves much higher than anyone had thought anddrained more actual reserves than anyone had estimated as the Treasurybalance came through. As a result, through almost the entire periodthe Desk found itself fighting reserve shortages, and much largerreserve shortages, than anyone--the Desk, the New York Fed, the Board,or the Treasury--was estimating. So it was constantly behind in thatway. Secondly, of course, there were a lot of market expectations atthat time that we would be firming. And the markets tended to pushthe federal funds rate up in anticipation of some firming of policy,given what was happening to the dollar and inflation. In some sense,I think borrowing rose in response to the market's push of the fundsrate up; there was extra inducement to borrow at the window. So,there were a number of factors that came together in the intermeetingperiod before the May 19th meeting that tended to give much largermisses between actual and intended borrowing than we ever hadexperienced before, except at year-end periods", "MR. JOHNSON. It would be interesting to know that. I havetwo other questions. One major issue is this: I realize that there'sa standard error plus or minus--I'm talking about borrowings relativeto the funds rate and the standard error you mentioned of about 60basis points--that creates noise in the system. If so, there's acertain amount of that noise that we have to accept; but that's plusor minus. There's a difference between that and the long-term issueof when we detect some sort of shift. I think the question arisesthere [unintelligible] policy shifts, that we're making a monetarypolicy adjustment whether we are doing anything or not. And thequestion is: If we detect a long-run shift in the borrowing functionshould we try and offset that in some way. Otherwise, we reallyaccept a policy adjustment because nonborrowed reserves are going tobe lower or higher", " When welook at seasonal borrowing by itself we find a significant seasonal;but when we lump it in with adjustment borrowing that seasonal getsswamped by all the other--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But isn't that because we're aiming at atotal borrowing figure including the seasonal. Otherwise, we offsetthe seasonal in the seasonal", "MR. KOHN. Yes. In effect, we're saying that the seasonalinfluence isn't strong enough to push the whole thing around. TheDesk actually has a different view of that. Frequently, they see ahigher seasonal [influence]", "MR. KOHN. Yes, close to it. It would have a trough of $100million and a peak of $300 million, and in a tight year such as 1984,maybe $400 million", " I certainly don't think it makes muchdifference if the level of borrowings is $1 billion or something, butmaybe if it is so low--MR.

You have to ask yourself: Are seasonalborrowings more like adjustment borrowings or more like open marketsupply credit", "MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes, possibly", "MR. KOHN. Yes, we did free reserves, net borrowed reserves,and it did not improve the relationship; in fact, it was worse inrecent years", " In the LRR period it was about the same; but in the CRRperiod the excess reserves have fluctuated and we've made moreadjustments, so the free reserves--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

SEGER. What do the relationships look like if you don'twash out the variations within a maintenance period. It seems to methat by averaging that you would knock off quite a bit of thevariation before you do your statistical study", "MR. PARRY. Don, your work indicates that the relationshipbetween the spread and borrowing is linear. Is it more reasonable tothink of that as a nonlinear relationship, since banks have a tendencyto become more reluctant to borrow as that spread widens", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe I didn't read this carefully, but Icame out with the opposite conclusion: that the relationship is soloose that we're not doing that", "MR. TRUMAN. Well, I think the answer to your question is notterribly robust. As that chart that I referred to shows, for thosecountries the growth is in the 2 percent range, on average. Growth indomestic demand is somewhat faster. The current situation presents asomewhat mixed picture. Germany, after a very weak first quarter,which was partly a seasonal weakness that is not seasonally adjusted[in the statistics], seems to have moved quite rapidly in the firstcouple of months of the second quarter, according to the availabledata. Unfortunately, Germany has shown more strength in theirexternal accounts than one might want to see from our perspective.Japan, on the other hand, had a better first quarter and things seemto have become a little soggier in the second quarter. However, theyhave put in place the fiscal package that was announced just after thelast FOMC meeting, and that was somewhat more than we had expected.That has led us to boost our forecast of growth in Japan for this yearand next year. So, we have real growth in the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percentrange in that country and in the 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent range inGermany. The somewhat prolonged slowdown in growth in Germany doesseem to be having some effects on the rest of western Europe. I thinkthe projection for France also has been marked down in recent months.The only country in western Europe that seems to be doing quite wellis the United Kingdom. It all depends on how you read these things,but that in part seems to reflect a boost from the depreciation of thepound last year and the somewhat easier fiscal policy--they wouldn'tdescribe it that way--that they seem to have gone into this year. Wedo see some drop-off in growth in 1988, in part reflecting the fact7/7/87that the economy has recovered this year. And as far as Canada isconcerned, we see things largely dependent on [unintelligible]; so youfind growth in the 2 percent area next year. On balance, it's notmuch of a favorable picture and [there's] not much scope orwillingness to foster very much [further growth]. We have built intothe forecast some further downward adjustment in the interest rates inthese countries, though I would say it's quite modest, presumablytriggered by a discount [rate cut] or [unintelligible] some exchangemarket pressures to bring that about", " Aside from the Japanese fiscalpackage, which we assume will pass before the [unintelligible] go intoeffect, and the German tax cut that comes in the first quarter of nextyear, we really have no other major policy that--MR. BOEHNE. Have you given any thought to what theimplications of the outlook in the United States plus the outlook thatyou just gave for Europe and Japan might have on the less developedcountries and their external accounts", " You'll get $5 to $10billion off--MR. STERN. I guess what bothers me about this forecast isthat you have the dollar going down somewhat further and interestrates higher than they were the last time we met, and you have takensomething off real growth. The directions are all right but it seemsto me that the adjustment is kind of small. If things work out thatway, I would think we would be looking at slower growth than you havehere and something that would be approaching a stagflationenvironment", " But we were badgering Germany and Japan, Ithought, to stimulate their economies so that there would be--MR. TRUMAN. I believe that we're better off, in some sense,than if they had chosen for their own reasons not to accelerate thetax cut in Germany and not to adopt the fiscal stimulus in the case ofJapan. But that's not enough to boost the overall level of productionin those countries; in fact, as I've commented, looking out into 1988we now see domestic demand slowing a bit further", "MR. PARRY. Yes", "MR. MORRIS. The number that I find rather depressing, and Iwant to make sure I understand it, is your projection that the Federaldeficit next year is going to be about the same as in fiscal 1987.After $25 billion of deficit reducing actions and after what I recallwas a fairly sizable increase in the Social Security surplus--which Iassume is in these numbers--we still end up with no change in theFederal deficit. And on top of that you're projecting a wiping out ofthe state and local government surplus, a low consumer saving rate,and some decline in the inflow of foreign capital associated with thereduction of our current account deficit. To me, all of this adds upto the possibility that we will see much higher interest rates, as aconsequence of all of these forces, than you have been suggesting", " We think there's--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I could say something, but I thinkwe'll get into this later in some more sophistication presumably thanMr. Prell has indicated", "MR. PRELL. I have to do the arithmetic to get to the net.Looking at the government sectors combined, as a percent of GNP wehave a 3.3 percent deficit last year moving down to 2.6 percent thisyear and then to 2.3 percent next year. So there's a significantmovement this year and then some modest further movement next yearwhile net foreign investment declines by 0.7 percent over that period.That is almost, I'll say, 3/4 of the movement in the governmentsector. In gross terms private saving is about unchanged for 1987 and1988 in our forecast", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody else have any particularquestions that are contrary on this presentation. If not, I would askyou to present your alternative scenarios, if any, that you think areimportant. I don't want to interpret the group as all being in fullagreement with the staff. Mr. Parry", "MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, our forecast for thisyear is basically in agreement with the Greenbook but we departsomewhat [for 1988] on both the real growth and the inflation side.We think that real GNP is going to be more in the neighborhood of 2.8percent, which is the number we used in our wire to the Board's staff.That's basically because of our belief that personal consumption isgoing to be stronger than the Greenbook indicates. We also think theinvestment forecast for 1988 is a little on the sluggish side in theBoard staff's forecast; we think it's going to be a little better thanthat. Also, we don't see quite the improvement in the trade situationthat the Greenbook implies and that translates into our forecast forinflation which we have rising somewhat faster than the Greenbook. Infact, we put the GNP deflator at 4.3 percent, which is about a halfpoint higher than the staff expectations. Unlike Governor Heller, ifI understood him correctly, I think the Federal budget deficitprojection is a little on the optimistic side; I think it's perhapsgoing to be higher than the $167 billion that the staff isforecasting. And that might give a little stimulus to the economy aswell. The one place where I think we are in agreement, if Iunderstood the staff forecast correctly, is that we're likely to getwage pressures toward the end of this year and out into 1988 simplybecause we're operating probably at our potential in the economy at-25-7/7/87the moment. And if the inflation number that I have is right, thatwill in turn put some pressures on the wage front", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. The New York Bank's ResearchDepartment forecast has basically the same bottom line as the Boardstaff's forecast but there are a couple of very important differencesin the assumptions. In the forecast of the New York ResearchDepartment--I distinguish that from my own forecast, because sometimesthey're not the same--they basically have no further change in theexchange rate over the forecast period from about the levels of thepast month or so. Vis-a-vis the Board staff's forecast that reallyconstitutes a very large difference because it reflects not just the 9or 10 percent [decline that is forecast] for next year but also whathappens over the balance of this year. So, the net difference is morelike 13 or 14 percent from where we are right now. Now, because wedon't have that further decline in the dollar we get some spuriousfeedbacks from that. For example, in nominal terms, our currentaccount number for next year is actually better than the staff'snumber even though in real terms the opposite might be the case; it'shard to tell there precisely. But by not getting that further 13 or14 percent of J-curve effects we actually end up with the spuriousresult, at least in the near term, of a better current accountsituation in 1988.The other thing that is true by assumption is that while wehave some build up in interest rates I don't think it is quite assharp, by implication, as maybe what you're talking about, Mike. Butwe get a different mix: we pick up a little more in terms of domesticspending and a little less perhaps in real terms on the net exportside. It washes out in terms of GNP to about the same although, as Isaid, the current account--which for financial purposes is important--is actually better in 1988. The other thing that is troublesome isthat, notwithstanding the fact that we have by assumption no change inthe dollar, our price numbers are higher, if anything, than the staffnumbers--not by a whole heck of a lot, but they are higher. Indeed,it seems to me that when you look at all the price forecasts that arearound, certainly the overwhelming consensus of the forecasts, thoughnot all of them, is for a situation for 1988 in which the deflatoreither bumps or passes through 4 percent and the consumer price indexeither bumps or passes through 5 percent. And in some cases theconsumer price index gets up into the 5-1/2 percent range. Withoutbeing too precise, I am just thinking of those thresholds of 4 percentand 5 percent. I'm hard pressed at this point to see what, short of arecession or some major slowdown in economic growth, will prevent thatfrom happening. In other words, given labor market conditions, importprices, and all the rest, that kind of result seems to me to be almostbaked in already. To the extent that developments either in oilprices or other things work the wrong way, so much the worse. So, Ifind it troubling that--and I'm referring to my personal forecast onthis--I end up with such a price outlook, again just focusing on those4 and 5 percent thresholds, despite a different assumption about thedollar exchange rate. When looked at it in terms of a growth patternof say, 2-3/4 percent, just to pick a number out of the air, that'stelling us that we're at the point where we've got to pay for some ofour past sins. If we have faster growth we're going to have moreinflation and we're going to have less external adjustment. And when-26-7/7/87I look at that growth pattern for next year of, say, 2-3/4 percent, Ithink it's about the best we can possibly hope for", "MR. ANGELL. It seems to me that there's more assuredness, asI read it, in the 1988 numbers than I quite feel. I'm somewhat moreoptimistic in regard to the rate of wage pattern change than the staffforecast. But I hasten to add that I believe that if you wait untilyou do get the wage inflation change that accompanies the staffforecast then it's too late not to have a price impact from that. SoI have a very strong resistance to creating an environment in whichthose wage patterns might develop as the staff and some of the rest ofyou seem to be indicating. It seems to me, if you look at the wagepatterns over the entire decade of the 1980s, that you do see a ratherslow, gradual, moderation of wage patterns. And when you look at thekinds of interest rates and unemployment rates that have existed, itseems to me that it takes more of a movement of the actualunemployment rate compared to the assumed natural rate to jar wagepatterns out of the existing mold. So I would expect there to besomewhat more delay; consequently, it seems to me that there is somewindow of opportunity to bring price pressures more in line before a-28-7/7/87wage adjustment takes place. But I am grateful to the staff forcontinuing to indicate to me the danger of this because I don't wantit to happen", "MR. JOHNSON. I don't have too much to add. The numbers Ihad in mind for 1987 and 1988, at least in terms of real and nominalGNP, and maybe even the deflator, probably are a little moreoptimistic. Overall, the [Greenbook] GNP and deflator numbers arevery close to what I had in mind. Like Governor Heller, I had aslightly different view of the financial implications of that. Butthere are so many \"ifs\" I really don't know the answer at all", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know; I would like to believethat. And if you look at just goods versus services it sounds right.But if you look at goods, I wonder whether that is a likely result.It cannot be resolved today, but if you look at it industry byindustry where is the trade improvement likely to take place. Wouldyou, in fact, find substantial amounts of slack. In some cases yesand in some cases no, I suspect. But where does the balance lie", "MR. KOHN. That will bring it to 5-1/2 percent", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, in reading this discussion of thealternatives in the Bluebook, I was struck by the difference betweenthe way some of us used to view these ranges several years ago and theway in which we are approaching them now, which seems to me to be verydifferent. In the past, some of us thought of these aggregates asintermediate targets and we selected ranges that we felt would beconsistent with progress against inflation in the context ofreasonable economic growth. And, of course, one of the advantages ofthis fairly direct relationship was that we made an announcement onthe ranges and it was reasonably clear as a signal to both the publicand Congress of what our intentions were. This present approach is, Ithink, very different from that. What we are doing now, as I thinkthe Bluebook makes very clear, is projecting a broad path of interestrates that we think will be consistent with a desirable economic-31-7/7/87outcome and then we project the ranges for the aggregates that wethink will be consistent with that interest rate path. Now, I realizethat the increased sensitivity of the aggregates to interest ratesmakes this a logical move but I worry that this approach, if we followit too slavishly, is going to lead us to deemphasize the aggregates tosuch a point that these ranges will cease to be reasonable signals tothe market as any kind of confirmation of our longer-term objectives.Thus, I would have some reservations about reducing this 1987 rangefor M2 even though I recognize that a good case can be made for doingthat on the basis of the prospective behavior of interest rates overthe next 18 months or so. I think some professionals in the marketwould clearly understand what we are trying to do; but I think therewould be a lot of other people who would not understand it. Theywould likely interpret it as a considerable move toward ease in theshort run, which seems to me to be pretty unwise, given theuncertainties regarding the overall economy and inflation. So I thinka better approach would be to leave that range unchanged and stateexplicitly that there is a possibility that it may be appropriate tocome in under the range if the recent trends in velocity continue.If you want me to go on to 1988 I would say that I would takealternative II, which would reduce all the ranges. If we do that,though, I think we ought to have a sentence, which I would be glad tosuggest if anybody has any sympathy with this, to explain therationale behind why we are reducing these ranges--that the furtherreductions are going to be required over time if we are going toextend the recent progress we have made against inflation", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You confused me a bit. Let me ask you aquestion. I don't remember your exact words, but [the thrust wasthat] they are real targets and we don't change them but explain if weare going to miss them. Are you really going to try to make it [intothe range] by not changing them", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The whole issue is--and Mr. Kohn, this isa question that you can answer--have we ever before said explicitlythat we have this target but we expect to come in below it or aboveit", "MS. SEGER. I'll be brief. I favor maintaining the ranges ofalternative I", "MR. JOHNSON. The only thing I would say is that I mightfavor just a 5 to 8 percent range on M2 instead of a full one pointreduction to 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent. I might be a little morecomfortable with 5 to 8 percent rather than 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. 5 to 8 percent is alternative II,isn't it", "\"MR. JOHNSON. No, that's not true. No", "MR. JOHNSON. You've got to make some assumptions. We aremaking different assumptions", "MS. SEGER. Well, just to take advantage of the full range ofalternatives, I will vote for alternative I, primarily because thestaff's beautiful forecast failed to convince me that the economy isas strong as we would like to see it and as they suggested it is. Iam also less confident about the outlook for the economy. I wouldlike, of course, to see the strong trade turnaround, and I hope ittakes place; but I am not really convinced that it will to the extentthat they are assuming. So I would prefer to go with 5-1/2 to 8-1/2percent again, with the understanding that we have another crack atthis early next year. If I am wrong and the economy is roaring along,then certainly it can be adjusted and I don't think anything will havebeen lost. We'll have plenty of time to send signals to the markets,in my judgment", "MR. MELZER. One of the things that concerns me a little isthat we get down to ranges that embrace trend velocity growth andfactor in what we expect in nominal GNP and the ranges roughly bracket-41-7/7/87that. If we start to take into account short-term velocity behaviorto drop the ranges down even further, that's almost building in thefact that at some point down the road we are going to have to jackthem back up and move them around. Maybe this is a historicalquestion in terms of what the tradition is. But I would tend to viewthese, particularly for M2 and M3, as much longer-term. I would becomfortable, therefore, embracing a trend velocity concept togetherwith a nominal GNP forecast; and that would lead me roughly to the 5to 8 percent range for M2, which is what I would favor. I think thereis a danger if we get these ranges down so far that, first of all, weare almost making it necessary to project interest rates to set thetargets because of the sensitivity of velocity to interest rates.Also, later we might get into the situation Wayne described where justbecause we change our outlook and interest rate forecast, we'rejacking them up and sending a false signal", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm going to make a little case. Ithink these are too high. What do we want to do. We have an outlookhere which is always uncertain in real terms. It is quitesatisfactory; it's about the best you could hope for if you believethe staff analysis of a slow growth domestically and a pickupexternally. Nobody has discussed the point that Mr. Prell madeinitially that we had quite slow--people like to call it sluggish--growth and a decline of one half percentage point or more in theunemployment rate in the past year. I am not sure we could standvigorous growth and a decline of 2 percentage points in theunemployment rate in the next year. I don't know how you resolve thatlittle dilemma.It seems to me that it is perfectly evident that the forecastthe staff has for prices--though I am not sure that it is right--leaves us in a totally unsatisfactory position a year from now, withthe inevitability of a sizable recession if we are going to have anychance of restoring price stability. Once that gets built into thewage outlook, it is just a question of when; it is going to be messy.I am not sure that is the outlook. I find it a little difficult tothink that the prices are going to be that high with the wages at themoment being as good as they are. But certainly, the recent evidenceis not very good in terms of what is happening in prices despite theperformance on wages. I would agree with what you said, Mike, thatonce it has broken the wages, you're dead. And a lot of hard workwill come unwound. What can we do about it. We only have one tool.For one thing, I would play for stability of the dollar, unlike thestaff forecast. And I would not take a further aggravation on theinflation rate or risk there and hope that a further decline in thedollar is not needed to produce the uncertain trade effect. I wouldcertainly work on the budget deficit. There's not much we can doabout it, but at least we get some protection on the growth ofdomestic consumption as well as on the financial side and interestrates. I worry about minimum wages and all that stuff. Now, when itcomes to monetary policy, I would be cautious. I think it would be abig mistake not to be cautious. We have talked about a half percenthere; it's imagery, but that is where I would come out. I think it isvery hard to present a suitably cautious outlook without changing therange this year. I suppose we can decide that we will probably comein low and we are willing to. But we are going to have a higher ratenext year that encompasses a more or less satisfactory nominal GNPgrowth but assumes a totally unsatisfactory price level. That is myspeech for the afternoon", "MR. HELLER. Lowering the targets this year, I think, wouldbe interpreted as a signal that we want to be tighter than we werebefore. And with the dollar rising at the present time, I see verylittle reason to tighten right now. Why do it at the presentjuncture", "MR. PARRY. You mean you would adopt a different borrowingstarget as a result of that", "MR. ANGELL. We found with M1, with the interest ratesensitivity of its velocity, that under non-normal conditions we werenot able to forecast what its target path would be and we had to endup abandoning it. It seems to me that we don't want to forceourselves into this preciseness for M2 that might later cause us tosay: Well, we just can't hit it at all", "MR. BLACK. I am repeating myself, but I really do think thiswould come to a head if we would address the short-run target. Ithink it makes the long-run a bit easier because we either send asignal or we don't and that strengthens or weakens the case for themost favored alternative", "MR. KOHN. The Committee indicated its expectation thatgrowth in M1, adjusted for shifts in NOW accounts, over the year as awhole would be near the lower end of its annual range. Both of thebroader aggregates on the other hand--and this was the instance whenM3 was above the range--had been running at the top or somewhat abovethe upper ends of the ranges. Given their behavior the Committee saidtheir growth might be toward the upper part of their ranges for theyear as a whole", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I am going to ask the staff. Do they knowwhat to say at this point", "MR. HELLER. I think the 4 to 8 percent is really going toofar. First of all, it's a very, very broad range. Because then we[unintelligible] just fuzzy things over. We are not giving a realmessage there. Talking about the bottom end of the range, I disagreewith the implications of the 4 percent growth for M2, certainly fornext year. Actually, if we use the 4 percent growth as a matter ofpolicy and get an unintended velocity change, where would we be. Ifwe have anywhere near the inflation that is projected, we'd haveeither zero or 0.5 percent growth. That is all that's left for thereal economy. So 4 percent growth, I think, would be too tight; 5percent leaves some room to grow", "MR. PARRY. I would like to ask a question about thisuncertainty issue and the 4 percentage point band. Are we suggestingthat there is a greater uncertainty because the analysis that has beenpresented by staff and others suggests there is greater uncertainty.Or are we just trying to widen the band because there is a greaterdifference of opinion and we can't fit people within a 3 percentagepoint range. I think there is a big difference", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a relatively small problem. Why isthe range so large. I am not so sure about velocity", "MR. BLACK. With \"woulds\" or \"mights\"", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, does anybody want to express aview", "MS. SEGER. Can we have a different tilt", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. No, reverse it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I tried to include something in my presentationabout velocity; that's why I had the velocity chart in there. Ourview is that, while less is wrong with M1A than is wrong with M1, it'sstill not that good an aggregate. It's still interest sensitive; muchof the trend in its velocity that's extended beyond the trend in M1velocity is a combination of offsetting propitious events, includingderegulation and interest rate declines. And in fact, its velocitytrend did break in early '85.

If youwere to take another look at your forecast for the third quarter--incorporating the most recent data with regard to employment, retailsales, and production--do you think the number you'd come up withwould be higher. And is it possible that the weakest quarter of theyear, in fact, could turn out to be the second quarter", "MR. PARRY. But you have more than a doubling of the growthrate of PCE, and final sales are up very substantially in the thirdquarter", "MR. BOEHNE. I'd like to explore a couple of areas. You madethe point that 6 percent unemployment, more or less, is getting intothe kind of full employment zone where you start to get inflationpressures. It seems to me that as you look across the country, andeven within regions, there is such a variability of unemployment ratesthat this average can be awfully misleading. Take my District, forexample. We have a number of areas where the unemployment rate isaround 3 percent. We also have a few areas where the unemploymentrate is 8 percent. And I would guess that across the country, youwould find unemployment ranges from 3 percent to, maybe, 10 or 12percent. Doesn't a lot depend on where the additional growth comesfrom. For example, we're going to see the growth coming inmanufacturing. Does that 6 percent mean what you would think it wouldmean, on average. It seems to me that is the kind analysis which,while it has an appeal, is greatly oversimplified, given thevariability. That is one area you might talk about", " We have a sense that the labor market has tightened,though we have not seen the pressures on wages in--MR. BOEHNE. The other area I'd like to explore is the tradenumbers. You made the point that, in the forecast, we count onimprovement in foreign demand to more than offset the weaker domesticdemand. And yet, if we're moving sideways in terms of real exports--in a context of weak activity in Germany and real doubts in Japan--howdoes all that fit together. How do you get a boost from the foreignside when real net exports are moving sideways and you have weakness", "MR. PARRY. Not in the third quarter", "MR. MORRIS. I have a gut feeling that the economy in thelast half of this year and going into 1988 is going to be strongerthan we have projected, and I've been examining numbers trying tofigure out where the greater strength will come from.

In recent months, we've seen a very strongtrend in new orders for capital goods. Yet in your projection, afterthe current quarter, you show only a very modest growth rate. Do youview this as an area of vulnerability in your forecast", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, our forecast also is pretty muchin agreement with the staff forecast. We have strengthened ouroutlook for the national economy for the rest of this year and going-14-8/18/87into next year. We think we do have a rate of expansion that issustainable. Subjectively, it is a little hard for me really tobelieve all that, given what has been going on in our particular partof the country. While we are seeing a little improvement, wecertainly are lagging the rest of the country. Both anecdotally andstatistically, we can kind of show that we are working through thetrough; but the recovery, to the extent that there is one, is sofragile that it would not take very much to have us continue thedownturn that we've been in for the last couple of years. Referencehas been made to energy. We have seen a little improvement there,certainly, in terms of perceptions. There has been a littleimprovement in construction, but it's not in building; it's in roads,public construction, that sort of thing. Manufacturing looks prettygood. In agriculture, we are continuing to see cropland valuesdecline and we are not through yet; of course, we came into this ayear or two after the Midwest, in particular. And, of course,everybody reads about the conditions of the financial institutions.One concern that we are hearing, primarily from people in mid-sizedand small businesses, is that they're very concerned that they're notgoing to get credit. And without credit, they're not going to be ableto grow and expand and create jobs. This is something that we'rehearing more and more. The banks are not willing or able to lend, anda cutoff of credit has occurred; and they don't see very much end toit", "MR. BOYKIN. That's a lot of it, Jerry. The bankers say thatthere just is not any loan demand. The small and mid-sizedbusinessmen say we have the demand but banks won't take the risk.

I agree in general with what the Greenbook saysand what I've heard about the outlook. I do think it's picking up; itlooks better and there is some growing upside risk. However, I have anumber of concerns that really cause me to question this viewcompletely, and there are a few problems that I have with theGreenbook forecast, in particular. So, I'm still uncertain, overall.First, the growth that we see appears to be primarily due to theimprovement in real net exports; export volume is causing the stimulusthat we see right now. And, if that is indeed the case--if most ofthe growth is coming in the external area rather than in domesticaggregate demand--you have to really ask yourself how much of thepotential Phillips-curve type effects on pricing you can get from thatkind of growth. And that modest expansion in aggregate demand, Ithink, is being verified somewhat by the aggregates, as well as byother types of evidence for consumption. You really have to ask howmuch inflation pressure can be produced by that type of a scenario.When you look at the broader inflation indexes, the CPI, excludingenergy, shows some pressure, but the PPI shows no influence outsidethe energy area. As a matter of fact, it has been decelerating thisyear, ex-oil. So you really don't see a broad buildup yet on theprice side.-15-8/18/87The staff forecast has rising interest rates, and I thinksome of their policy assumptions are inconsistent with the forecast.That rise in interest rates, at least if the aggregate models arecorrect, is going to produce a further weakening in the monetaryaggregates. Looking at a further weakening in the monetaryaggregates, you have to ask yourself: How much nominal GNP can youget out of those kinds of aggregate growth rates, and does thevelocity number that is consistent with that make any sense at all toyou. I don't think you can get too much from a rising interest ratesscenario out of the aggregates to produce enough nominal GNP toproduce a serious risk.The other point I have is on the movement of the dollar. Oneproblem I have on the dollar is what I pointed out yesterday in theBoard meeting: we really have had no net depreciation of the dollarthis year. Now, there's always the possibility, and I continue toworry about the downside risks on the dollar. I know it has come offa little today; we've talked about some of the reasons. But the factof the matter is that there has been no net dollar depreciation thisyear and we're late into the year. The forecast is contingent upon a10 percent depreciation in '87 to produce the lagged effects on pricesin '88. Of course, there are still four months of opportunity forthat. But you have to ask yourself, if you're not going to realizethat kind of dollar depreciation this year, how are you going to getthose lagged effects for '88. The other point is that if the oilprice is expected to hover in the $18 range--and it's my feeling thatthe dollar is being influenced some by the oil price--an oil price inthat range will keep the dollar high relative to the currencies ofmajor industrial surplus countries like the mark and the yen. And ifthe dollar stays stronger because the oil price hovers in the $18range, how are we going to get the dollar depreciation. On all ofthese questions, I'm not saying that they can't be overcome, because Isee the outlook picking up some, too. But I really haven't resolvedthese questions in my mind and I think they are serious alternativeissues to deal with. So, given these problems, I don't think we haveenough evidence to expect a big upward move", "MR. HENDRICKS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our views ofeconomic conditions closely parallel the staff's forecast in theGreenbook. As some others have suggested, there are a couple of areaswhere we differ a bit. One is in the growth of income, and the otheris in consumption. On balance, it appears to us that the economy ispicking up strength. Employment, output, and exports are expanding,as we see it, and we have noticed a jump in prices. Comments by ourdirectors and others support this view. Even the hardest hit sectors--commercial construction, agriculture, and metals--are said,particularly by our directors, to be enjoying a period of stabilityand possible turnaround. So it's not surprising, I guess, that wewould suggest that our forecast shows more strength, on balance, thanis indicated in the Greenbook", "MS. SEGER. I hope that the staff forecast is right ontarget, but I do have some questions and some doubts, I guess. One ofthem that I expressed yesterday at the staff briefing [to the Board]involves our emphasis on the trade turnaround. I'm just not convincedthat we will get as much of a boost to the overall economic picturefrom the trade turnaround as we are counting on in the forecast eitherfor the rest of this year or in 1988. It was mentioned earlier thatsome of the trading partners have economic situations that are farshort of robust. So I think that's a key factor. Also, no one hasmentioned it, but there are trade barriers out there that businesspeople tell me about. And some of the obvious ones involve trying toget into the Japanese market. Also, I'm not convinced that the dollaris going to fall as much as we're assuming in our forecast. I realizeit can be banged down but, as Governor Johnson said, there are thingsgoing on that may prevent that from happening. Also, the staff istalking about some gradual upward drift in interest rates. That may-18-8/18/87happen, depending, of course, on what policy stance we take. But Iguess I don't see as much of a bite on the economy from that upwarddrift as I might have expected. Looking at autos--and this would bemore of a near-term situation than for '88--I think it's going to be alot tougher to reduce those inventories than apparently you think,Mike. Some of the specific makes have over a 100-day supply; that'snot worked down easily even at 1.9 percent interest rates. One of thereasons they have so many is they haven't a lot of sex appeal in themodels; they may have to just give them away on some Saturday night, Idon't know", "MR. BOEHNE. Mr. Chairman, I think that there is a case to bemade for some tightening for all the reasons that have been stated:the risk of inflation in the economy and also the history of probablywaiting too long. I am not ready to make that move at this point. Ihave enough doubts, and I think there are enough uncertainties, aboutthe outlook for inflation and other aspects of the economy. Thesentiment around this table has fluctuated a good bit in recentmonths, and I think we very well may be heading into a period wheresome tightening is appropriate; but I think it is premature at thispoint. I would favor a directive that would maintain the $500 millionof borrowing, something along the lines of alternative B. However, Iwould give the directive an asymmetrical tilt indicating that ifpolicy needs to be changed in the intermeeting period, that we wouldmore likely lean in the direction of some snugging than some easing.So, I would be for no change, alternative B, with some asymmetricalwording that would tilt it in the direction of some tightening, shoulda change be necessary", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would like to raise a point withrespect to that. This directive goes through a very short period oftime. And I'd raise the question as to whether or not it is really anoperational directive at all, because by the time this is actuallysomething that is likely to happen, we are beyond the period which weare focusing on, with respect to policy in any event. That's at leastmy view; I don't know how the rest of you read that", "MR. MELZER. I read that, at one point, to mean the oppositeof what it is intended to mean. I think it could be interpreted thatway", " If you were worried about the slow growth, you might actuallyencourage--MR. STERN. It seems to me, if anything, that is certainlytoo open-ended the way it is currently written", "MR. ANGELL. It seems to me that we need to remind ourselvesthat these minutes will be published six weeks from now, around thetime of the next meeting. It just seems to me that we ought to besomewhat careful about making asymmetric statements when there is thismuch uncertainty. I think the real question is what do we do, not thequestion of symmetric or asymmetric. I would prefer a symmetric \"B\".Now, that puts me at the far end of those who have been speaking sofar. I do believe that the monetary aggregate growth paths are quitedifferent from those we had in the period that led to the pricepressures we are now seeing; and I think it is a mistake for us toreact with the monetary aggregates behaving in this nice 2 to 4percent growth range, which might very well be the right path for thelong run. Yet, as you anticipated, Mr. Chairman, and I would agreewith you, we do have this change in velocity. It would be a mistakefor us, then, to go to $600 million on borrowing, because $600 millionwill certainly be a vote for a lower monetary growth path. Themembers of the Committee know that I have not favored returning themonetary growth paths back to within our target ranges for the year; Ihave favored coming in below the ranges. But, just as a year ago, wewere undoubtedly somewhat careless in not recognizing the 15 percent-27-8/18/87monetary growth path when we made that discount rate change lastAugust, I think it could be just as much a mistake for us to move nowbefore we see the need. I am prepared to make adjustments as might beneeded if commodity prices and the exchange value of the dollar wereto move in such a direction as to make inflation and our worst fearsrealized. I would want to move at that point, but I am not willing totake a hard position now for minutes to be published six weeks fromnow based upon our feelings", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is that $600 million", "MR. ANGELL. I wasn't quite certain what the vote was inregard to the dollar's position. I would be among those who wouldlike to leave the dollar as being an important indicator, somewhatmore prominent. But I may be out-voted, I'm not sure", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Frankly, it's a close vote", "MR. STERN. I agree with Wayne, in part because when thisdirective is published it would seem to me to be an awkward time to-32-8/18/87have downplayed the dollar if the dollar continues to do what it hasbeen doing the last three or four days. I don't think you gain much", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Can I ask a question. We had thestrength of the business expansion at the bottom of the list the lasttime. As I read it, there's a fairly strong consensus to move thatup. Would there be any objection to moving that as #2 afterinflationary pressures.SEVERAL. That would be good", "MR. ANGELL. You're going to leave it at 5 to 7-1/2 percent", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The general view is for just droppingit. Anybody object to that. Strongly. That leaves us with the fundsrate", "MR. ANGELL. I don't think anybody will know it's $525million; you don't tell anybody", " That is, you can go firmer, based upondevelopments, without calling a Committee--MR. HELLER.

I have a motion; do I have a second", "MR. MELZER. Peter, you reported on the first 11 days; thereis apt to be a pretty large borrowing spike Wednesday. How would youexpect that to be interpreted in this environment. This is a periodthat has had some technical problems with the tax date, so I guess youare not going to be able to conclude much from that either", "MS. SEGER. Peter, did I understand you correctly when thequestion was asked about the market response to what might happen toborrowings before this maintenance period is up. Did you say youthought we could come in around $600 million without stirring thingsup. Isn't the arithmetic to get $600 million in this period such thatit would require tremendous borrowings today and tomorrow. And ifthose borrowings occur in the context of the knowledge of this meetingdate, I think [market participants] might make something out of thatrather than just saying, well, it is one way to get the average towork out right. I don't think they know what we are shooting for", "MR. JOHNSON. Second", "MR. PARRY. I would like to ask two questions about yourassumption with regard to fiscal policy. This time, as has been thecase in the past, there is an assumption that there are spending cutsof around $25 billion. I think there is a substantial risk that thatwill not materialize. Some work we have done suggests that if policyis accommodative and you don't get that $25 billion deduction inspending, that it could add approximately a percentage point to growthin 1988 and a half percentage point to inflation. Would you thinkthat to be roughly [the magnitude]", "MR. PARRY. You don't get the $25 billion reduction; you getzero", "MR. BOEHNE. I would like to follow up on Bob Forrestal'squestion. Basically, the U.S. strategy for turning the trade deficitaround is to shrink the value of the dollar and to get our tradingpartners to grow faster than we are growing. We have done fairly wellon the dollar, but we haven't done so well on growth abroad. It's anappealing strategy, but it strikes me as being somewhat novel if youlook at the history of these kinds of adjustments. What has happenedmost often is that the country that has the deficit ends up with arecession. In other words, you reduce domestic demand below what ishappening abroad and you also get downward adjustments on thecurrency. And I would think that the longer it takes for us to make aturnaround in the trade deficit--as we get month after month of thesedisappointing trade figures--that it would put additional downwardpressure on the dollar. And it might also begin to raise expectationsthat, well, as nice as it sounds to try this rather novel strategy, inthe end, the U.S. is going to have to go through kind of a wringer, asmost other countries do. My real question is: How much of a novelexperiment are we really running in light of what is happening inother countries and what has happened over history. I am having ahard time thinking of a country that hasn't turned around this kind ofa trade deficit without a fair amount of suppression of domesticdemand. And the question is not aimed at [criticism]; I like theapproach that we are on. But it does strike me as somewhat novel onthe broader stage of history. I would just like to see if that isright or if we have had lots of company with this experiment", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, most of the comments have beendirected at particular parts of the forecast. My feeling the lasttime was that the economy would be somewhat stronger than theGreenbook was projecting, and the staff, indeed, have moved theirforecast in that general direction. So, we have very little quarrelwith what they have done. We think the main driving force is going tobe an improvement in net exports of goods and services; and plant andequipment expenditures, particularly in the equipment area, alsoprovide a pretty good push. If we were to guess, we would say therisk might still be that the forecast is a little low. But reallywhat bothers us, I guess, is the feeling that they might be right onthis forecast. In saying that, I'm focusing on the inflation ratethat they are projecting for next year--when it goes up to 4-1/2percent. I think we ought to be able to do better than that for nextyear, and we ought to target something less than that. A 4-1/2percent inflation rate could easily become 5 percent; and 5 percent isnot really reasonable price stability. So, rather than thinking theymay have overestimated, we're afraid that they might be about rightand have come up with some results that are a little too strong on theprice side", "MS. SEGER. The other question I have again ties intoyesterday's briefing, and relates to our heavy reliance on the tradeturnaround to produce a good 1988. If I'm reading the numbers right,about half of the real GNP growth, fourth quarter of 1987 to fourthquarter of 1988, is expected to come from improvement in net exports.Again, I think it's very, very difficult to get a $54 billion increasein exports in one year--namely, this year--and then tack on $57billion next year. That's just a lot to produce", " In other words, the dollar--I wasn't clear what--MR. MELZER. What I'm saying is that the box we are in rightnow is that, as a practical matter, if we tolerate that dollardecline, it kicks off inflationary expectations. So, let's say thatyou just assumed that the dollar was stable. How would that affectthe forecast", "MR. HELLER. Wait a minute. You say that interest rateswouldn't be rising; but you can also come up with that scenario of acontinued stable dollar that comes about because we are raisinginterest rates in this country. Then, how would your answer bedifferent", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do both", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes, but I would say that while Ithink the bulk of the increment has been driven by these inflation-related things, I also would say that the level of the real interestrate does come out higher. Maybe, just maybe, that's because there issomething happening in terms of the marginal productivity of capital.It's possible", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, I guess it's somebody's turn tosay something not quite as positive as we have been hearing. I guessit falls to my lot, being from the Eleventh District. I wouldcharacterize our economy in the Eleventh District as still somewhatsluggish and a little fragile, although there have been tentativesigns of improvement. Businesses around the District that serve anational or international market all seem to be saying that they areseeing some improvement. These would be primarily in electronics,livestock, chemicals, and defense. There is a little more optimismthere. The businesses that serve their own local area or region,-22-9/22/87though, say that their business remains flat; they really have notseen any signs of improvement. Obviously, there is a correlation inattitudes and sentiment related to oil prices, since oil is soimportant in our region. With the improvement there, and with theincrease in the oil rig count and additional activity going on, thereis more optimism. There is a little more activity in relatedbusinesses; all but construction-related manufacturing are growing.Agriculture is stabilizing, and cotton and livestock farming are doingfairly well. Our retail sales remain fairly flat. We continue toworry somewhat about the condition of our financial institutions.Pick up a newspaper and you'll still find reports of foreclosures andbankruptcies continuing. Last week in Austin, which was really thebright spot for the last several years in Texas, there was the postingof a foreclosure of a fairly major hotel-office complex that waspretty new. There were foreclosure postings in Houston, also, of twoor three fairly well known good projects. This doesn't mean theforeclosures will actually occur; the postings could be part of arenegotiation. Nevertheless, it is upsetting. We saw a report lastweek that Dallas had lost 40,000 jobs over the last year. That seemsawfully high to me, but those are the kinds of reports we are hearing.Though we hope that we are on a comeback trail--and, if oil priceshold, I think we will be--I don't think we have seen the bottom of ourcommercial real estate problem. I think we probably are going to beworrying about that for at least two years, possibly three, before wecan work through that.On the national picture, and possibly I'm somewhatinfluenced by our own Eleventh District, we would come out--lookingout through the rest of this year to 1988--a little below where theGreenbook is this time. Although we moved our own forecast upslightly, we didn't come as far as the Board staff has in theGreenbook. On the long-term rate, I don't know that I have anyparticularly useful insight into that except that the evident concernabout inflation does not seem to be quite as deep among the peopleI've talked to; certainly, in our District, there is not really[unintelligible] to the problem", "MS. SEGER. In a prior life, I worked with corporateplanning, so I was just sitting here thinking of that in ourdiscussion this morning. First of all, when you work with corporateplanning, your bosses are always challenging your forecasts and theywill not allow--at least mine didn't allow--you to utilize a singleforecast. Or, if you did, they were always wondering about where theweaknesses were and whether or not something might hit them that wouldput them out of business. You are not allowed to bet the bank, or betthe company, on forecasts. So, I just wanted to mention a couple ofthings that I think we have to look at as we look ahead. One that Isort of hinted at it earlier is whether or not we are sufficientlyincorporating the interest moves we have already had into thisforecast. And if we are, are we incorporating the interest moves thatwe expect are yet to come. Also, there's the question: what if thedollar does not, in fact, decline more. So much of 1988 depends uponthe trade turnaround; and if we think a weaker dollar is needed toproduce at least part of that, then I think that is a vulnerability inthis forecast. Also, and this has been mentioned by Wayne Angell andBob Heller, I really think we are not paying much attention to thechange in fiscal policy. When you go from a $221 billion deficit to$160 billion--and I've heard this morning that it might even come inbelow $150 billion--that's a major change from one year to the next.I am not necessarily a Keynesian, but I do think there is such a thingas fiscal policy, and it certainly works with a lag. I remember thesummer of 1984, sitting around this table with many of the people whoare here today, and it was very easy then to simply project the trendsof early 1984, which looked tremendously strong. And, frankly, wemissed the fact that business was going to slow down; just about thetime we thought it was looking most terrific was when we got the 90-degree turn. I hope we are not doing that today.On the interest rate question, because I am an old lady Iremember being in financial markets before inflation was a big deal,mainly in the 1960s. And interest rates moved up; one of the reasonsthat long governments moved up involved simply the volume offinancing, which is, of course, tied to the deficit. And, as BobHeller said, recently we have had these problems with bumping upagainst the debt ceiling and postponements of auctions. Then, all ofa sudden, Congress gets religion and takes care of this, and you getfive auctions pushed through in a very short period of time, and thisjerks things around. And yet, if no one was talking about inflation,I think that would happen. It certainly happened in August. It'sprobably going to happen again in the next couple of weeks. Also,there is just uncertainty about what's going on, uncertainty aboutwhat we are doing here. I think we could help that problem if wereleased the minutes earlier so that people would not have to analyzeevery tea leaf to try to figure out what we're up to. I think that-31-9/22/87contributes to this situation. Also, there has been improvement incommunications and information flow. If you go back to the 1960s and1970s, not every person around America and around the world had a CRTon his or her desk. Now every gunslinger sits there and, whereas theyused to be told that the one thing to watch was M1, now they have beentold that the one thing to watch is the relationship between thedollar and the yen or the dollar and the mark in the foreign exchangemarkets. Most of these people are not economists; they are traders;and you give them two easy pieces of guidance and that is what theytrade on. So they contribute to this instability, I think, as you getthis transmission from the exchange market into the bond market withthe speed of light almost. There are just a lot more players and Idon't think they are necessarily really weighing what's going on inthe real economy; and neither do I think that they are doing athorough analysis of the inflationary forces at work or not at work", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. In the time frame you were looking at,were they down more than we were in real terms in that time", "MR. HELLER. In real terms what", "MR. HELLER. They what", "MR. MELZER. I would align myself with Bob Forrestal'sposition: \"B\", with a $500 million borrowings target and asymmetriclanguage. The main thing that is influencing me is a longer-term viewand, I guess, trying not to get out of position. And I think BobBlack said it: any way you look at this--whether you look at rates, atthe provision of reserves, or at the behavior of the aggregates--overthe course of this year, we have taken some significant steps. And Iam not quite sure, as I expressed earlier, what the impact of that isgoing to be. But, being an old market participant, when everybodythinks the same there's a chance that it won't work out that way.Sometimes you get a little afraid of a consensus that is apparentlythat strong. Having said all that, I could certainly accept \"B\", witha $600 million borrowing target and symmetric language.

A week ago, we were talking about walking a thin linebetween the dollar and the domestic economy and I get the feeling thatthat thin line has broadened out some since a week ago. How wide isit and do we have a policy or don't we have a policy. Is it theTreasury that's making U.S. policy or are we just kind of letting themarket take us where we go or do we have some sense of where we wantto go with the dollar. There have been a lot of changes in sevendays", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why don't I respond to that, and thenSam Cross can correct me. There have been significant disputes overthe years as to precisely what the relationship is between theTreasury and the Federal Reserve with respect to the question ofexchange rate intervention. As I understand it, even though there aredisputable issues here, we largely tend to follow Treasury's lead inthis question. The Treasury's position, while basically favorable tothe Louvre [Accord] as a general procedure, is that they nonethelessare interested in making certain that we don't endeavor to defend aparticular position which is indefensible. And, I would think thatwhile the general view of the Secretary sort of backed and filled onvarious occasions, ideally, he would like to see the markets stabilizeon their own without any actions on our part, whether through monetaryor intervention policies. But, should that not occur, his willingnessto commit U.S. resources is limited. And the general impression thatI get, although it is not articulated necessarily sharply at alltimes, is that if the market moves us down gradually without anysecondary consequences until we reach a market equilibrium, that wouldsuit the Treasury just fine. There is, however, I think a generalawareness that this all could get out of hand and that there could bea lot of dangerous, secondary problems. But it is the Secretary'sview--maybe I should use the word \"hope\" because that is morerelevant--that that will not materialize. So, I would say at themoment, that while the Louvre [unintelligible], it is clearly fading;and it will continue to do so unless and until there are dramaticpolicy shifts on the part of the Treasury, which I must say to you, Ithink would not be appropriate. Irrespective of what has beenhappening recently, I would say that we are not freely floating but weare floating in a way in which the degree of intervention that theTreasury is willing to commit is very minor", " This strikes me as--MR. MORRIS. I think they are very much concerned about toomuch intervention increasing the German money supply as it did in1978; and they want to avoid that", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There is concern of that. I found thatPresident Poehl is, I would say, somewhat less firm than Mr.Stoltenberg on this question. And, I think what Manley Johnson istalking about is really to the point: they have constructed forthemselves a series of monetary targets carved into granite by means11/3/87unknown to anybody; and the credibility of the Bundesbank is at stake.If you go into the market and intervene heavily, you may think you arefully sterilizing [unintelligible] but it sort of leaks all over theplace. I think that there are significantly different views. I wouldgather, but I'm not sure, that what President Poehl was saying lastnight necessarily is speaking for the German government in total, butit does reflect a significant part of his views. You were there,Jerry. Is that your impression", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. What could they do. What theyshould have done was do something several years ago. But what shouldthey do right now", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think we have to remember what theissue of the dollar is. It is not that it is falling per se, but thatwhatever it is doing creates a judgment in the market that it willcontinue to do that. There are really two ways to look at this andthat is really, I think, what divides the economic fraternity at thisstage. If, somehow, somebody could wave a wand and move the exchangerate down sharply to a point where the expectation of future changewas zero, then the yield spreads between intermediate or long-termissues in dollars and those denominated in the other currencies woulddramatically come together; and we would get the type of stabilitythat we would like. The problem, unfortunately, is that the otherpotential is that a sharply [falling] dollar merely will beextrapolated, as Sam Cross has implied. Here, we don't know, largelybecause we don't know where the bottom is. Obviously, the lower weare the closer the bottom is, by definition. Exchange rates tend tobe non-negative, though sometimes you wonder. Judging from the waythe markets have been behaving the last several weeks, I think theprobabilities that a freefall is about to happen or could happen havediminished. Unfortunately, the trouble is that even if theprobabilities have diminished, the consequences of that event areextremely dangerous. Even if we get to the point where we are allfully, unequivocally, convinced that there are no secondary reactionproblems in the exchange rate, I think we had better keep up ourguard", "MR. ANGELL. If we were to go back to 1983 and 1984 and havepeople look at it in terms of where the dollar should have been at11/3/87that point in time, the dollar didn't stay within what anyone wouldsuggest was a workable U.S. balance-of-trade level. When the marketcould go to the extreme on the upside and run the dollar up to 161 onour index--when any careful analysis would say that that didn't makeany sense--why do you have such confidence that somehow or other onthe downside true market forces will prevail in the midst of politicalwhims and a political climate that could be devastating. A trulyfloating exchange rate environment is really quite different than anenvironment in which you have political posturing and then it appearsthat [the floating exchange rate environment] is gone. It seems to methat there is extreme danger that at some point in time the dollarcould become a serious problem. Given the Treasury's policy, I thinkwe have only one choice: we have to make domestic price levelstability our primary objective and, if the world believes that, thenI think the dollar will be okay", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. And you will find, as you just heard,that you have people who don't agree with you on the other side ofthis table", "MR. CROSS. Yes", "MR. CROSS. On the question of [unintelligible], the FederalReserve does have the legal authority to intervene and the Treasuryhas the legal authority to intervene. But there are a number ofstatements and letters and so forth to the Congress which indicatethat from the point of view of the Federal Reserve, we will operate incooperation and coordination with the Treasury on these matters, giventhe Secretary of the Treasury's role in international financialpolicy. And it is important that we not act in direct violation ofTreasury's stated views; or if we did, it would be such a major eventthat we would feel it necessary to tell the Congress. So, basically,we have operated for many, many years on the basis of trying to workthese matters out with the Treasury", "MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

Obviously, that goes against everything elsewe know: that the lower the price, the greater the demand. In atechnical sense, every time we get a change in the exchange rate whichleads to a change in long-term yields, what we are looking at, ineffect, is a change in the far-distant forward position of theexchange rate. In other words, if the exchange rate is falling andthe bond market is collapsing--assume it's against the yen and theyen-denominated securities are not moving--what effectively is11/3/87happening is that the short-term decline in the dollar-yenrelationship is creating an expectation of a very much sharper declinein the future. That's the critical issue. It is the expected rate offorward deterioration in the exchange rate which translates into basispoints on the yield spread in the long-term, risk-free instruments.And, it is conceivable that we will get to a point--at some point, Ihope--that the exchange rate will arrive at a level which the marketsperceive will not go very much further, and the forward position ofthe dollar will begin to rise and we will get a decline in long-terminterest rates. The danger here is that with the huge block of U.S.dollar-denominated securities outstanding, psychological cracks couldinduce tremendously rapid changes and create high degrees ofinstability. So, I think that something happened last week. I thinkone can argue that there has been an odd form of delinking--that thereis a presumption that declines in the dollar do not imply that therewill be future declines in the dollar. The trouble is that it mightbe what happened last week, and it may be what's happening this week,yet next week the markets might turn right around on us and go in theother direction. But, I do think it's important not to think of it inthe sense of a tight linkage about what Federal Reserve policy isgoing to do, although it does seem that way. I think we have toremember that we are dealing with real variables and that the marketstell us a great deal in this respect", "MR. PRELL. [Statement--see Appendix", "MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, I have a comment and two questionsconcerning the Greenbook forecast. My comment: considering the modestwealth and cost of capital effects of the stock market decline, andalso what is referred to as an expected appreciable fall in interestrates, it's surprising to me to see real growth for 1988 at less than2 percent. Now, my first question deals with real disposable income.We have talked about this in the past but I think it has even greaterimportance today. Real disposable income in the Greenbook forecastrises so slowly relative to real GNP that I really doubt that thatforecast will occur. The difference in growth rates is 1.2 percentagepoints. In our forecast, there's a difference of one tenth of apoint; in the Blue Chip consensus of 30 economists, it's two tenths ofa point. A distinction of that magnitude is, I think, pretty muchwithout historical precedent. It is my understanding that the waythat occurs is that you have an increase in inflation as a result ofhigher import prices, which causes the PCE deflator to rise verysubstantially relative to the GNP deflator. And, as I am sure youknow, the relationship between the PCE deflator and the GNP deflatoris one of the most stable relationships we have. We looked back to1973 and that relationship varied between .988 and 1.021. In theforecast, it gets up to 1.026, which is an incredibly high level. Idon't think it has ever been that high. And my question is: If youhad a ratio between the PCE deflator and the GNP deflator which ismore traditional, how would that affect the staff's forecast of both", "MR. PARRY. The statistical work that we have done indicatesthat all of the increase in the PCE over that period that you justcited can be attributed to oil and none of it to foreign exchange", "MR. PRELL. Well, I guess we differ on this", "MR. PRELL. Obviously, as you know, it's a confluence of twothings. One is how fast industrial output is growing, which is quitesensitive to the mix of output in the economy; and the improvement intrade is reflected in growth of industrial production and amanufacturing component that is stronger than overall GNP growth by apoint or more next year. The other component in this calculation,obviously, is an assessment of capacity growth. Business fixedinvestment, which had been weak for a while, rebounded in the lastcouple of quarters; some of this rebound reflected a spurt inautomobile sales which presumably will not be sustained. Of course,it takes a little while for growth in PDE to feed through thesubstantial increases in the stock of capital goods. We have arelatively weak investment outlook, so from that side of things wewouldn't see tremendous additions to capacity over the coming year", "MS. SEGER. One thing that concerns me, as I said before--whether you formalize it or don't formalize it mathematically--is thatnot having experienced this kind of period, I just suffer fromuncertainty about what it will bring. Also, I wonder if a 20 somepercent decline in the Dow on one day is really the equivalent of fourmonths' worth of 5 percent declines each month. I have a feeling thatit's not comparable. I don't know, but I have a feeling that thereare a lot of things in here that, at least based on my inexperience, Icannot really judge", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, uncertainty certainly prevailsdown my way. In looking at what might be appropriate for forecasting,we really would not have much basis for argument [with the staffforecast], but in our own forecast we have come down a full point;that is very judgmental, obviously. As far as the effect on ourDistrict economy, our initial reaction is that probably whatever theeffect, it is likely to be a little less in the Eleventh District thanin the rest of the country, simply because we are so much fartherbehind the rest of the country. We have seen signs of sluggish growthin the District. We think the situation continues to be extremelyfragile. The real estate problems keep coming up and are a pervasivecloud in the psychology. The earnings reports that we have just gonethrough with our financial institutions, and the added provision forloan losses--most of it triggered by real estate--just put anotherdamper on that. The cautious optimism that I tried to express for acouple of meetings seems to have abated somewhat. I'm not sure we caneven be cautiously optimistic right now", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. In the very near term, Mr. Chairman,I don't think there's much doubt that the stock market and relateddevelopments do work in the direction of weaker spending and lowerinflation. But I am not at all sure as to amounts and I am not at allsure what one should infer for the longer term. There are probablyseveral dozen scenarios that anybody could think of. Unlike Mr.Prell, I don't have to put one on paper but, in my thinking, there aretwo more likely scenarios in the near term. One is that the financialmarkets, and by that I mean all of them--exchange markets, bondmarkets, stock markets--kind of settle in more or less where they havebeen in the last couple of days. I don't know where they are rightnow, so I have to qualify that. But suppose the Dow settles in at the1900-2000 range, the long bond settles in at 9 percent or a littlemore or a little less, and the exchange markets are roughly in linewith [the levels of] recent days. Now, in that scenario, my hunch isthat economic performance will be respectable but not spectacular overthe intermediate term--probably something like what I heard Mr. Parrydescribe, which I don't consider to be all bad, by the way. The otherscenario, which I think has to be thought about along with that one,isn't so pretty. And that's a scenario in which for whatever reason--because the exchange markets go south or the budget negotiationsrupture--there's a sudden hit to the system. Who knows what the exacttrigger might be, but we could find ourselves confronted with anothervery, very difficult and turbulent set of conditions in the financialmarkets. Obviously, I can't put a probability on that. But if I wereto just think of the two broad scenarios that would warrant theclosest attention from a policy point of view, I guess those are thetwo that stick out in my mind. Interestingly enough, at least from myperspective, they both seem to me to have the same immediate policyimplications in that they both imply the need for a great deal ofcaution in policy, and a very measured and disciplined approach topolicy in which we maintain maximum flexibility for the future.11/3/87I would also, if I may Mr. Chairman, like to make a commentor two about the longer-term situation as I see it, because I thinkit's extremely germane both to where we are and to policy options forthe future. There is, of course, a great deal of discussion in allcircles about imbalances in the U.S. and the world economy, whether interms of trade or payments or whatever. But, we should not lose sightof a couple of powerful forces on the domestic side that I think aregermane. One is the dramatic increase in debt, in leveraging, that wehave had in recent years: the ratio of overall nonfinancial debt toGNP--and I understand all the limits in the data--has risen fromsomething like 1.41 in the early 1980s to almost 1.81 early this year.It may be coincidence--it probably is--but the fact of the matter isthat the last time we saw that ratio in a range that high was in thelate 1920s. And it's not all government debt, although governmentdebt has a lot to do with it. Since the first quarter of 1984, thenet issuance of equity is down $270 billion and corporate debt is up$600 billion. Again, if you look at this problem of governmentdeficits and savings, it's really quite dramatic. In the late 1970s,the general U.S. government budget deficit as a percent of net privatesavings averaged about 10 percent. It has risen sharply throughoutthe 1980s, peaking at 66 percent in 1986. Indeed, in 1986 the federalbudget deficit itself absorbed more than 90 percent of net privatesavings. And even in 1987, that absorption rate relative to domesticsavings will fall only to the mid-50 percent range. I stress thatbecause in the context of all this discussion about budget packagesand all the rest, I think we have to keep in mind that, even under thebest of circumstances, the kinds of things that are talked about inthe area of budget reform are really quite small. Indeed, there is agreat likelihood that the budget deficit in 1988 in absolute termswill be larger than in 1987. It is in that context, I think, that alot of these acute dilemmas and very, very sharp risks have to beevaluated and considered", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I too agree that the outlook isextremely difficult to forecast because we are in a fairly newsituation here. But, it seems to me that the events of recent monthssuggest that the Louvre Accord was an agreement to maintain the U.S.exchange rates at levels that were not sustainable. We have haddifficulty financing the deficit this year with private capitalinflows. In the first quarter of this year, that reluctance of theprivate foreign investor to keep on providing money at the pace neededwas reflected in the downward movement in our exchange rate; but thatwas stopped by the Louvre agreement. Subsequently, it seems to me,the pressure generated by this reluctance of foreign investors to putas much in as they had so willingly in earlier years was reflected inrising interest rates. We had marvelous stability in the exchangerate but our bond rate was under upward pressure because of reducedforeign demand. And that is what ultimately led to the big drop inthe stock market. The market had become extremely overvalued relativeto bond rates of return. Standard & Poor's 500 was yielding 2.7percent at a time when intermediate-term governments were yieldingalmost 10 percent. That was the biggest spread between dividend yieldand intermediate-term bond yields in history. So it was clearly anunsustainable situation. Now we have to try to figure out how wepermit the dollar to adjust downward without that being transmittedinto upward pressure on the long-term bond markets. And I thinkthat's going to be a very tricky proposition for us. But there is nodoubt in my mind that we have to go to a much lower level of thedollar. The question is: How can we keep the domestic economy movingahead even at a relatively modest rate in that context. I attended a-23-11/3/87meeting at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank where a couple of brightyoung people from the Board presented a superb paper. I hope that ithas been distributed at the Board because it tells a lot about why wehave not had any more adjustment in our trade account than we have hadthus far. And the reason is that the import price levels have gone upat an amazingly low rate. In the most recent period, reportedyesterday I think by the Bureau of the Census, import prices went upin the third quarter by less than 2 percent; I think that reflects,and the paper supports this, that foreign producers who have gotteninto this market are very reluctant to give up markets here and aregoing to try to hang in here as long as they can. It seems to me thatit is going to take a level of the dollar well below any long-termequilibrium level to begin to make the kind of progress I think wehave to make in reducing our foreign deficit. So our problem for thenext few months is going to be a very tough one: How do we handle thisball of wax on the declining dollar and avoid not putting all kinds ofpressures on long-term bond rates that are going to be verydestabilizing for the domestic economy. If we have another runup inrates, we are going to see a new low in the stock market. I don'tthink there's any question about that. So, I think it's a mostunstable financial situation. I wasn't around in 1929--at least I wasnot old enough to know what was going on--but I can't recall a periodwhen we have had such an unstable financial system as we have right atthis moment", "MR. JOHNSON. I really don't have much to add but I'll put inmy two cents' worth. I basically agree with Ed Boehne's view aboutthe domestic economy that it's too early to tell what the effect isgoing to be of all this. We really don't have any serious data at-24-11/3/87this point to evaluate the situation. I think we are probably notgoing get data that we are going to feel confident about, in terms ofbeing symptomatic of the effects of this, until a couple of weeks,maybe. Retail sales data are three weeks away; we may have some earlycar sales data and things like that but the orders impact of this isdown the road. There's a lot of information that still is notavailable; the only thing we really have at this point is some of thesentiment indexes. So, we don't know how to read the overall impact,although I agree with Ed that it's hard to imagine sentiment improvingas a result of this. I think it's pretty clear that there is anadditional air of pessimism about the outlook that didn't exist beforeand that expectations definitely have changed. What effect that'sgoing to have is difficult to tell.If you look right now at the fundamentals in the economy,they do look good; I agree with Bob's point on that. Things areadjusting fairly nicely in the way that we expected and in the way thestaff had described in the forecast. We are seeing a transition, Ithink, from domestic aggregate demand to more externally generatedgrowth. I think that is positive and it still seems to be continuing.One of the things I worry about now--after the fact, with this changein the financial markets--is that that export-led growth may comeunder some pressure. Even though the dollar is obviously weaker, itis going to improve, I think. In that relative sense, other problemsare going to [damp] the prospects for export-led growth. One of theissues in the financial markets is that foreign stock markets aroundthe world actually have fallen more than the U.S. market. Inpercentage terms, they have all come down by more than the New YorkStock Exchange composite. So, the stock market impact abroad isgreater than it is here. What that means is really not clear. Butcombine that with [these other developments]: the fact that interestrates in those countries are relatively higher because of the fall ininterest rates here recently and the not very large adjustment ininterest rates abroad; the fact that their currencies areappreciating, and therefore, damping their ability to export; and thefact that if income is going to be falling here, we are going to bedemanding less in terms of imports from those countries. So, not onlyis there going to be an income effect on them, there is going to be asubstitution effect. And I think the question is: How strong arethose economies going to be. And how strong is our externalperformance going to be under those conditions. I don't really know;I just think there are big uncertainties. And I agree with what Jerrysaid: we need some flexibility at this stage, but it's really tooearly to tell what is going to happen. We need to maintain ourflexibility, but we need to face the reality that the world haschanged. Sentiment and expectations are different, both in realgrowth and in inflation; and I think we have to acknowledge that", "MS. SEGER. The two words that I think describe mostcompletely what is going on are confusion and uncertainty. All of thebusiness economists and business people I have spoken with in the lastcouple of weeks admit to both of those. Practically no one pretendsto know exactly what the impact of the financial market disturbanceswill be, but almost everyone expects some sort of an impact. Probablythe most dramatic adjustment that I witnessed was atwhere, unfortunately, the event caught them in the middleof the planning season for 1988. They immediately knocked 5 percentoff their sales forecast up through the next year and also looked for-25-11/3/87two plants to close--a truck plant and a car plant. Their view wasthat back in the early 1980s, when the auto industry was going intothe pink, they said they were cutting off a finger at a time ratherthan doing major surgery. So, this time around they want to beprepared for more dramatic and significant adjustments if, in fact,they are needed. They are watching very carefully what is actuallygoing on so that they can do additional adjustments if necessary.They also have made some dramatic changes in the management of theirpension funds, which are very, very large. They have cut back on thepercentage invested in equities. They also have cut back on thepercentage in long bonds and have moved into a very liquid position.I just mention that because I think it is one specific example thatsome people in the business world are reacting.Not knowing what is going to happen, I guess one of mynightmares is that what might happen is that consumers will cut backon their spending, as Mike has laid out in the Greenbook estimates,except that they will cut back a little more dramatically even than weare estimating in the next couple of quarters. The rich lawyers willcontinue to buy Mercedes and Peugeots and Hondas and things like thatthat are produced abroad but they will cut back on their consumptionof domestically produced items and, therefore, we will get sort of adouble whammy: we will have the weak consumption but, also, we willnot see the import situation improving as much as we are expectingnow, and as much as I certainly would like to see. Yet, I am notsaying we are going to get a recession; I don't really know. But Ithink we ought to think about what the risk is, and ask: If we do geta recession, is that going to help the problems that Jerry Corriganhas ticked off. I don't think so. Going into a recession with aheavy debt load doesn't usually make the debt load any lighter; itjust makes it look a lot heavier to service. Also, I don't think thata recession here would help our trading partners. As I read thegrowth numbers in Germany, Japan, Canada, and some other countries, itseems to me that they are not all that robust anyway. They do dependa lot upon their business dealings with us and, therefore, I can'timagine that we wouldn't take many of them with us, which in turn,would make our new-found ability to export a lot more difficult totake advantage of because you have to have somebody to buy thoseexports that we now can produce efficiently. So, to summarize, I justam concerned. And I really think that we ought to watch the incomingdata extremely carefully for signs of more weakness than we are nowexpecting", "MR. MORRIS. I have an impossible question for you, Don. Ifthe dollar goes down significantly in the next couple of months, whichI think is going to happen, how do we prevent that from spilling overinto a rise in bond yields. That is the conflict we are going to befaced with in the next month, it seems to me", "MR. ANGELL. Yes, Mr. Chairman I'm delighted to have you takethat position. I support you and alternative \"B\" and borrowings of$450 million. But I'd like to suggest somewhat of a variation on thatin regard to the fed funds range. Ordinarily, we would leave it at 5to 9 percent; but it seems to me that there are about three reasonswhy we might lower that to 4 to 8 percent under alternative \"B\". Andin part, this speaks to how that would be interpreted as people readthese minutes. In regard to President Morris' comments about upwardmovement in interest rates, a dramatic movement upward to the 9percent fed funds level seems to me very unlikely; that probably wouldbe destabilizing in financial markets. So I'd really rather have thatupward bound down a point. I'd also like to have the lower bound downa point to 4 percent because, while we are not anticipating it, theremight be some circumstance between Open Market Committee meetings thatwould give us the flexibility [to move] downward, and that might beappropriate. So, 4 to 8 percent on the fed funds range, even thoughit would maintain the policy stance about where we are, would give usa slight variation. Frankly, I would prefer staying with variation IIof the language [shown in the Bluebook], which is the more normalexpression. It just seems to me that the additional language shown invariation I could pose difficulties. The very nice thing about thestatement that was released by the Board Tuesday morning, October20th, was that it was very simple and short. And I would prefer invariation II to have the words read \"slightly greater ... might\" and\"somewhat less ... would\" be acceptable", "MR. BOEHNE. Well, Mr. Chairman, you're very persuasive interms of keeping things where they are, but I have a somewhatdifferent interpretation of where we are. It seems to me that we aresomewhere between alternatives \"A\" and \"B\"; we may be closer to \"B\"than to \"A\", but I think that we are in the \"A\" -\"B\" range forpolicy, with a federal funds target of something under 7 percent,-30-11/3/87perhaps 6-7/8 percent or just a touch higher. It strikes me,therefore, that if we go with \"B\" that we will, in effect, betightening somewhat even though it's a subtle tightening. And I sensethat if we deviate at all from where we are, that it might be betterto ease just a touch. So I come down being in the alternative \"A\"column. It's true that we have a lot of uncertainty and we don't knowwhat's going to happen. But I do think there have been enoughchanges, at least in terms of shifts in the direction of the risks,that it is important for us to help anchor the lower rates that wehave achieved the last couple of weeks. And it seems to me thatsomething closer to \"A\" than \"B\" helps to do that, because those lowerrates that we have had are important for offsetting the effects thatwe are going to get from the stock market. I think that it ought tobe clear that the Federal Reserve is trying to do that; and I thinkthat alternative \"A\" does that less ambiguously than alternative \"B\".Clearly, there is a risk in the dollar but, as I judge the situation,we're not talking about very much of a change in rates and it seems tome that the environment is such that we could probably absorb thatrisk at the moment. I would prefer Variant I of the language becauseI think it says more clearly what we are doing, and I think it'simportant that the directive that we put out says what we're doing.Even though the language is different, and we have words like \"beingflexible\" and so on, that's exactly the situation that we are in. Soit seems to me that's what we ought to go with. If we go withalternative \"A\", then I think some symmetrical language isappropriate, with \"somewhats\" and \"mights\" on both sides. Now, we areeffectively operating on a federal funds strategy. When we were on afederal funds strategy in the 1970s, we tended to have Open MarketCommittee meetings every three or four weeks. As we moved more into areserve-based strategy, we were able to lengthen out the meetingintervals to every six weeks or so. So it seems to me that whereverwe set the funds rate today, we are going to have to look at it veryfrequently. And I would think that we ought to plan at least onetelephone meeting two or three weeks hence, simply because if you'regoing to operate on a federal funds target, by necessity you have tohave more meetings", "MR. KOHN. We, of course, wrote \"B\" as $450 million becausethat's what we have been writing into the reserve path. I think youcan make an argument, and Peter perhaps will want to comment on this,that we really have been operating a bit easier than a $450 millionborrowing level might suggest. If you wanted to be certain, or ascertain as you can be on this sort of thing, that the center ofgravity for the funds rate really was below 7 percent and that it'smore likely to average in the 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent area and touch 7percent only seldomly, then a $400 million borrowing target might giveyou a little more assurance in that regard than a $450 millionborrowing target. And maybe that is a little more consistent withwhat we have actually been doing. Peter, do you have more", "MR. BERNARD. Yes", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. We do have a problem here, though.Let's focus on it because I may have to re-poll [those who havecommented already]. Listening to everybody so far, everybody islocking into a funds rate that is very much more narrow than the fundsrate that we are stipulating in this directive. The question that wehave to decide is this: In the process of formulating this directivedo we go with these very broad funds rate ranges, which is what wouldbe consistent with a specific borrowing target, or do we go with amuch narrower funds rate target, however we publish it, and have amuch broader range on the borrowing side. It's very difficult toencompass the type of funds rate targeting that we have been hearingaround this table in terms of 5 to 9 percent or 4 to 8 percent. Thisis a choice", "MR. MORRIS. Mr Chairman, I might request that we eliminatethat last sentence in Variant I, because we are talking aboutstabilizing the funds rate for a short period. It is a temporarypolicy, and I don't think it makes any sense to talk about a range of4 to 8 percent or 5 to 9 percent. I think we ought it admit that wehave temporarily changed the operating procedures; and that wouldimply that we ought to get rid of that last sentence and not talk atall about ranges that way", "MR. ANGELL. Well, I would certainly be opposed to our goingto an announced narrow fed funds target. It seems to me it is veryimportant that we do not have the semblance of returning to the 1970sstyle, which would really require frequent consultations to move it,-37-11/3/87and would give some the impression that over the long run we might bewilling to allow whatever reserves might be consistent with that. Iwould much prefer to have the wider range but with a temporaryunderstanding, as we have had in these recent weeks, that we expect itto be in the 6-1/2 to 7 percent area", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Take out all that stuff after thesemicolon. I'm at Variant I. The first sentence reads: \"In the-38-11/3/87implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeksto [decrease somewhat/maintain/increase slightly] the degree ofpressures on reserve positions\" and I would insert \"sought in recentdays", " We didn't listen to what GovernorHeller--MR. HELLER. It's a very minuscule point: in the draftdirective with the brown [Class I] cover, lines 20-21, we say\"business capital spending was strong in the third quarter and forwardindicators pointed to continuing gains.\" I think that's a littlestrong. It's certainly getting a lot slower. Maybe we could justdrop \"forward indicators pointing to continuing gains", "MR. ANGELL. I'm just not sure what that sentence says. Itseems to me that the uncertainty is somewhat directed at one side", " Isn't that what we--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. The sentence I think should read:\"Apart from such considerations slightly lesser reserve restraintwould or slightly greater might\"", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

They aremaking that judgment", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think there are two key questionshere that we need to consider. One is whether or not the funds rategives us the right signals if we target borrowed reserves, which hasbeen addressed by the staff. The other is whether or not it's reallyeasier--from a political standpoint, or to follow up on JerryCorrigan's point, because of inertia--to [make a policy] move underthe borrowed reserve procedure. Generally, the federal funds rateprobably does move in the right direction to give the correct signalwhen we are using a borrowed reserve target. But there are times when12/15-16/87it doesn't. For example, in 1984, around the time of the ContinentalIllinois Bank crisis, Chuck Partee had to reassure the markets throughan article in The New York Times that we were targeting borrowedreserves and that the rise in the federal funds rate did stem frombanks' unwillingness to borrow--that it really didn't have anything todo with a tightening of policy at that particular time. Also, rightbefore the market crash on the 19th, I think there was a perception inthe market that we probably would tighten at a time when we reallydidn't want that to happen. In general, a borrowing target probablyworks [to give the right signal] but it doesn't always work that way.There's a lot to Jerry's argument that there is inertia whenoperating under a federal funds target; the Committee, just because itdoesn't know where the funds rate ought to go, is less apt to move.There is also some substance, I think, to the political argument thatit gives us a certain degree of protection if we can say we reallydon't control the federal funds rate, we control borrowed reserves.At least at one time I think that did alleviate some of the concernsof Congress and gave us some protection. I'm not sure that's the casemuch anymore, except maybe in the case of some Congressmen. Themarket seems to look through this and be reasonably certain that wehave in mind a certain level or range for the federal funds rate.Moreover, if the borrowing really doesn't change and the federal fundsrate does change, they tend to think that's really what we want. So,I would be inclined to do something like alternative (3), which is togo back to borrowed reserve targeting but pay a little more attentionto the federal funds rate when it is not behaving in the way we thinkit ought to, and deal with it on an ad hoc basis. But my real hope isthat we can do what Bob Heller suggested--if we can ever get theaggregates behaving more normally--and that is, make someinstitutional changes and move toward a nonborrowed reserve target,which would have certain desirable automatic features that wouldenable us to ease or tighten without having to take discretionaryactions. I would hope that at some point we can move in thatdirection because now what the market gets is largely demand-determined and I think there ought to be a larger element of supply-determined in there than we have now because of the misbehavior of theaggregates", "MS. SEGER. I'd like to think of this in two stages. One iswhat I think is useful in normal or typical times, if there are suchthings. In those times, I'm perfectly willing to support an approachthat emphasizes a borrowings target, even though I have learned thatbecause we don't have nice stable relationships, we cannot predictexactly what a certain level of borrowings will produce in the way offed funds rates. But there are times when conditions are more unusualand abnormal, and I personally believe we are still in one of thosemodes at the moment. And in times like these, I think that we oughtto pay a lot more attention to fed funds because the markets are very,very nervous and skittish--not as much as they were October 20ththrough October 26th or 28th or whatever, but I don't think it's backto normal. I would hate to see us give the message inadvertently thatwe were tightening or engineering a major policy change because fedfunds rates shot up at the end of the year when we really didn't wantto give that message. I don't think that everybody out there in thereal economy and in the markets is that comfortable with what's going12/15-16/87on. Therefore, I would just urge us in the next few weeks to betriply sensitive, even though in two months or so we may go back towhat we were doing prior to October 19th, emphasizing the borrowingtargets. But I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with going backto business as usual starting tomorrow", "MR. BLACK. Yes, pretty quickly; but the first two or threedays they would read all sorts of changes in policy into that, I wouldthink", " Yes, but suppose it comes in at 2percent; substitute 2 percent for 9 percent--MS. SEGER. Yes", "MR. ANGELL. If you don't want to go to 9 percent, then put aceiling of 7-1/2 percent on it: or put a floor if you want to. I justwant to have more variance than we have been getting", "MR. HOSKINS. It seems to me that we are struggling with theissue of trying to tell the markets where we are. Perhaps one way todo it--and I think Jerry has already referred to it--is simply toindicate that we are returning to an operating procedure that is morenormal. There are a couple of reasons for doing that. We are tryingnot to give a miscue with respect to two things, it seems to me:first, whether or not we have tightened or eased policy; and secondly,whether or not we have moved to a different kind of interest ratepolicy. Because we don't want misconceptions out there about thosetwo issues, it seems to me we're better off providing more informationrather than less. Now, Peter did that before by protesting--by comingin early--and the market caught on very quickly. I'm not sure he cando that in reverse. So, I guess to some extent I would support Jerry.I'm not sure I caught the gist of his comments correctly, but[unintelligible]", " Don, do you--MR. KOHN. Well, I think there is a certain amount ofinertia.SPEAKER(.). Well, it's a certain amount in a series", "MR. KOHN. Then, in July, I think we tried to make a strongcase to the Committee that at that point there was a distinct dangerthat even without a further increase in interest rates the aggregatescould well fall short of their ranges. And if interest rates rose--which, in fact, they have--the chances were pretty good of theirfalling [below the ranges]. So, perhaps the point here is that themodels are not perfect, but they generally catch the drift. And theyare not bad in that they can explain most of the deceleration in M2and most of the deceleration in M1. So, we have a reasonably good,though not perfect, fix on the demand side; but the problem is that inorder to target an aggregate, you have to know where interest ratesand income are going--particularly interest rates. And, if itrequires much higher or lower interest rates at the beginning of theyear than you think, then you anticipate that in order to get theincome growth you desire, you're going to have much lower or highermonetary aggregates consistent with that income growth", "MR. BLACK. Don, I think you made an excellent case for nottargeting M1A or Ml for the coming year. Do you entertain any hope,as I do--although it's becoming a lingering hope, I guess--that atsome point depository institutions are going to alter their pricingprocedures on NOW accounts and OCDs so that they will reduce theinterest elasticity of M1 and make it a better target. Or is therehope that the demand for M1 will become more stable as this adjustmentprocess to deregulation goes further", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. In M2", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I think what is relevant here isthe time frame. If I would tell you 20 years, clearly the argumentwould have to be that it's more likely that the M2 trend would be moreprojectable than the M1A or the M1 trend. Therefore, if it's truewith 20 years, then the argument really gets down to what time frameyou're talking about. Well, I've always been worried about thatbecause I was convinced that at some point or other, we would projectand find out it went in the other direction. Bob Parry", "MR. MELZER. I have two comments about the environment we'redealing in. First of all, there is a lot of uncertainty about exactly-26-12/15-16/87how policy is being conducted in the long run. It's not unusual, butI think this is one of those times when there are those kinds ofquestions in the marketplace. And the kind of discussion we arehaving right now is very, very healthy in terms of talking aboutdifferent approaches. But, on top of the uncertainty that I perceivein the marketplace and some of the difficulties with the aggregatesand with interest rate targeting that we have talked about, I'd saythat we are now in a period--and I think it will be exacerbated--whenthere is going to be a conflict between the pressures we facedomestically and the pressures we face internationally in terms of howpolicy is conducted. And, I think there would be no better time tohave some kind of an intermediate target or guide.What I wanted to put on the table was the idea that had beenmentioned earlier of looking at a monetary base target of some sort.There is no question that we can control that, and I think it's a goodindicator of the thrust of policy. I don't have any delusions aboutthe ability to pick a specific growth rate of the base and say wetherefore expect nominal GNP to do \"Y\". Some of the work we have doneon the base and income relationships would indicate that therelationship is no worse than M2, for example. But, that's not reallywhat I have in mind. I think it is possible to select a relativelynarrow channel in terms of possible growth rates for the base that inthe long run would be consistent with satisfactory economicperformance and, at the same time, preserve in the short run thelatitude to react to all the various types of incoming data that wereact to now. In other words, this approach I'm describing wouldallow for discretion in the short-run conduct of policy but at thesame time--assuming we were to stick with it --it would take away someof the extremes in possible policy results in either direction: thatis, very simply, either too tight a monetary policy, or too easy amonetary policy.Right now, I don't think we have a lot of confidence in theother aggregates and I don't think the marketplace pays that muchattention to them. If we were to substitute some kind of a basetarget, first of all, I think the announcement of that would carrywith it a considerable positive impact just because the market wouldknow in general what policymakers are going to be looking at in theconduct of policy. And this channel that I have talked about wouldtend to eliminate uncertainty and increase credibility. I think theexistence of a target like that--if I'm right about the type ofenvironment that we are in and that we're apt to be in next year in aneven more important way--could be used to diffuse domestic andinternational pressures, to do something in the short-run conduct ofpolicy, particularly to influence rates. And in the long run, ifpursued religiously, I think it would tend to result in more stableand more balanced economic results. So, I guess what I wanted to dowas put the idea on the table. We've done some work, and I think wehave to do a lot more work, but if there were any support for thatkind of idea, maybe with more background work done it's something thatcould be discussed more thoroughly at the February meeting", "MR. JOHNSON. I think that's right. [It would be desirable]to have a sense of credibility that we could set a target and hit itconsistently. But the problem is that I don't think the base velocityhas done much better than the velocity of other aggregates. So, if weconsistently hit a target set on the base, we certainly would havecredibility in hitting the target, but would that credibility extendto economic performance. There is still the question of where to setthe target, and whether or not the target is accurately set relativeto what we want to achieve in terms of the desired results for theeconomy. And I think there is still a big problem with a base targetfrom that point of view", "MR. KOHN. I presume there would be a surge in demanddeposits at that time. Interest is paid implicitly now, to the extentthat firms get credits for their compensating balances in terms ofservices they receive. But, it is also the case that they don't getany credits for excess balances any more; and there are a lot of zerobalance accounts, where the excess is put into RPs or whatever. Theincentive to engage in that kind of deposit-minimizing behaviorobviously would be very much reduced if interest were paid on demanddeposits", "MS. SEGER. Secondly, didn't you say--I read so much forthis meeting I may have just dreamed it--that within the demanddeposit category most of that is, in fact, business accounts. Ifthat's the case, then I think the interpretation ought to bedifferent, because I've never met a big business or small businessthat decides to buy a new dump truck or put an addition on a buildingbecause they have more money in their checking account. I just don'tthink they operate that way. Maybe I would as an individual, or mycousin would, but I think we have to look at how we interpret thesethings because of the change in the ownership of the accounts", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I'm saying, Roger, that in theimmediate time frame I would have great difficulty with anything evenapproaching a monetary base operating target. I say that for severalreasons. First of all, I have never understood the base to beginwith. I have read all the great work that has been done in St. Louisand every place else. But, to me, the thing itself is kind of a pig-in-a-poke. And since I don't really know what it is, I'm not about toput too much reliance on it as a steering mechanism for monetarypolicy. More importantly, in the current circumstances, I'm veryskeptical that the market reaction would be the one that you aresuggesting. Having said that, I certainly share the frustrationsassociated with the current approaches to policy. But, given all thathas happened in the last few years, especially with any formulation ofmonetarism that I'm familiar with, including a base formulation, Ithink the reaction of the marketplace to a policy approach like thatwould be, \"Oh no. This ensures a renewed and high degree ofinstability in interest rates.\" And I suspect that people would taketo the hills rather than raise the flag, because of fears of a greatdeal of instability and volatility in interest rates that we haven'tseen in many years.Finally--I keep coming back to this--I, too, am frustrated bythe lack of a nice firm handle for monetary policy. But let's notlose sight of the fact that despite all the limitations, theperformance of the economy over the past several years has hardly beensomething we need to apologize for. I think economic performance, allthings considered, has probably been as good as it reasonably couldhave been. Again, that does not mean that I am insensitive to thefrustration that you're speaking from, Tom; I share that completely.But I'm very dubious that the base is a way out", "MR. MORRIS. Yes, but if it's not reliably related to income,the fact that you can control it is not very relevant to policy. I'vebeen sitting around this table for 19 years now, and I've concludedthat the search for an indicator for monetary policy that willovercome this yearning is a complete waste of time. I think historyshows that there is no suitable indicator for monetary policy that isgoing to give you reliable nominal GNP results. It's a waste of timeto look: the world is too complicated; the world is just toocomplicated. What we really have to do is go back to the kind ofthinking that was around the table when I first came to the FederalReserve under Bill Martin, and that is leaning against the wind", " And, in the short run--MR. TRUMAN. Well, for a long period of time. Theyabandoned it in 1982, five years ago. I don't know if they can goback, particularly to something like an M2 target, because they havethis financial deregulation in mind to play with", " Some are better than--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Some lose", "MR. CROSS. We have far more marks than we have yen for theFederal Reserve and the Treasury combined. We have about $11.6billion worth of marks, but only about $1.6 billion worth of yen", "MR. GUFFEY. That means, if we were to continue [interventionpurchases of dollars] for a very long period of time, we would have touse our swaps", "MR. BOEHNE. One of the reasons we haven't had a fasterturnaround in our current account deficit is that the fall in thevalue of the dollar has not even come close to being matched in termsof increasing import prices. It seems to me that exporters to theUnited States can have shrinking profit margins and try to hang on tomarket share, but with the kinds of shrinkages in margins that are atleast implicit in this kind of drop in the dollar-import pricerelationship, I think a lot of these exporters to the U.S. have to behurting pretty badly. I don't know how one measures that--whetherthere's any anecdotal evidence or any evidence whatsoever. But do wehave any sense that we might be seeing more of this dollar shrinkageshowing up or coming through more in higher import prices", " Twenty-two percent is the figure I have in mind,but it's--MR. TRUMAN. A little less than 10 percent against the yen", "MS. SEGER. I can send them some alley toughs from Detroit", "MR. HOSKINS. I'm just curious: Has anybody speculated as towhat we bought with that $100 billion and where we would be had we notspent it. And, secondly, you described a situation that seems to meto be indicating some strains amongst the G-10 countries regarding thenotion of further intervention. Does that imply that we are going toalter fundamentally some monetary and fiscal policies. In otherwords, are we not going to sterilize", "MR. JOHNSON. Nobody really knows which way this is going butcurrently there is some downward [movement] in oil prices. How isthat likely to affect the currency markets. Last year it seemed tohave put downward pressure on the dollar relative to the deutschemarkand the yen, and some downward pressure on the pound sterling, too", "MR. JOHNSON. That's not true Wayne. Earlier, when thefunds rate fell below the 6-3/4 percent level, we put off reserve addneeds, giving a strong signal that we didn't want it lower either", "MR. KELLEY. Mike, as you're well aware, there's a school ofthought out there that the economy has been running on the stronggrowth of the aggregates of a year or a year and a half ago and thatthe economy is about to go downhill as a result of the much flattergrowth of the aggregates in the last 9 or 10 months. If that's notyour expectation, then would you assess that expectation", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. When you're looking at the monetaryaggregates, I think it's important to recognize that when they wereworking and you could see the plumbing operating--meaning you couldsee the effect of changing monetary aggregates reflected in real GNPand the price level--the relationship was in sync. The problem thatwe have now in evaluating these data is that, essentially, we havegone through a cycle and a half in which the plumbing has beendisconnected. In a sense, we're getting very significant changes inthese monetary variables, but we don't see any filtering through. Theargument that slow money growth will inevitably lead to a recessionmay turn out to be true. The trouble is that there is no mechanismwhich can tie it together at this stage. We're caught in a situationwhere I suspect that the plumbing is going to get reconnected at somepoint and it's going to work again. The real trick is going to befiguring out when that's going to happen. The assumption that it isalready happening is not verifiable in the information, at least as Isee it", "MR. HELLER. It probably happened when we started ourmonetary targeting, because according to Goodhart's law, anything youwant to control will get out of hand. But that isn't my question.According to your projection, the deficit is going to worsen by about$20 billion to $165 billion. According to the Administration, it'sgoing to improve by about $20 billion to $123 billion. I waswondering what would happen to your forecast if the Administrationwere right", "MS. SEGER. Was $40 billion what we estimated", "MR. PARRY. How much of an adjustment would you make to thefourth-quarter net export number given October's rough order ofmagnitude. We have $18", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes. Achieving either one, in thecontext of the kinds of things that have been going on, is a longshot. But to put up an argument, even if all of those things workedright, the end-of-period situation, by assumption, would still leave atrade deficit of $50 billion and using very conservative interest rateassumptions, a current account deficit of $77 billion, or 1.3 percentof GNP. Our net foreign indebtedness at the end of the period wouldbe $900 billion, or 15 percent of GNP, and a country with a netforeign indebtedness of 15 percent of GNP--other than in war time orin the early stages of development--is quite unusual indeed. That'sthe kind of gradual adjustment scenario. Incidentally, that case alsoassumed no change in the real exchange rate from current levels.Another way to think about it is to impose a constraint onour current account balance by the end of 1991, again assuming nochange in the standard of living which means, among other things, no-53-12/15-16/87change in the real exchange rate. In that case, U.S. domestic demandkind of by assumption is 2-1/2 percent but real GNP would have to be 4percent. Now, here's the killer: foreign domestic demand would haveto be 6.6 percent and foreign GNP would have to be 6 percent. Thepoint, of course, is that I don't see any conceivable way to get fromhere to there under those kinds of assumptions--that is, maintainingdomestic demand growth and expecting that the whole adjustment, ineffect, is going to take place externally. That kind of scenariowould require growth in U.S. manufacturing output of about 5-1/2 to 6percent and growth in physical capacity of about 5-1/2 percent.Again, I just don't see how that could happen. But it would result ina trade surplus at the end of 1991, a $25 billion current accountbalance, and our net external debt would be about $785 billion, or 12-1/2 percent of GNP.The third approach that one can think of is something thatcombines a little of both: to superimpose on case 1, if you will, a 10percent further devaluation [of the dollar] that is front-end loaded--in other words, it comes mostly in the early part of next year. Thenagain, if the constraint is a current account balance in 1991, inorder to get there, U.S. domestic demand growth would have to besomething like 1.2 percent; GNP growth, 2.5 to 2.6 percent; foreigndemand growth, 3.5 percent; and foreign GNP growth, 2.9 percent or so.That would require manufacturing output growth in the U.S. of about 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent and capacity growth again of about 4 percent.That would also get you a current account balance in 1991. Theseestimates are obviously nothing more than an exercise in arithmeticand there's no suggestion that they are anything more than that.Obviously, one could quibble with any one of them, or all of them, butI think the broad profile that emerges from that kind of an exerciseis right. That broad profile says to me that any way you cut it, wehave a situation involving a huge unfunded external liability sittingout there that is going to have to be attended to. It says to me thatdomestic spending, at least by historical standards, is going to haveto be restrained and that there is considerable force to the argumentto stabilize exchange rates sooner rather than later. I can see verylittle to be gained by further instability in the exchange markets andfurther downward pressure on the dollar. As a matter of fact, itseems to me that the risks of further downward pressure on the dollarare rather asymmetrically on the side of making things worse, notbetter", " Of course, if either or both of those things don't happen,then you have problems because if the saving rate doesn't come up, andthen you superimpose a higher level of consumption spending than whatit is already, then your domestic demand --CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Then you won't get the adjustment inunemployment", "MR. HELLER. What are your inflation rates. You said theywere increasing", "MR. BLACK. It's the sort of scenario that would worry JerryCorrigan", "MR. JOHNSON. I agree with a lot of the comments. I'mpicking up the same thing: that the export side of things is verystrong. You don't hear anyone complaining about orders coming in andtheir ability to compete at these exchange rates and the activity oftheir businesses at this stage, so I think that on the production sidethings do look very solid at the moment. What's starting to troubleme a little though--and maybe I'm smoking something because I seem tobe a bit out of sync with some of the other views--is certainly not onthe production side right now but on the sales end of things. We gotrevisions on October and September retail sales, which were downconsiderably and down relative to the Greenbook, if I remember right.We have revised down the retail sales figures even [for the period]before the stock market crash; our view of domestic demand is weakergoing into the stock market crash than in fact we thought before,relative to the forecast. Now, I agree with everyone else: I haven'tseen the impacts of the stock market decline on consumption at thispoint. Retail sales were actually up modestly in November; automobilesales seem to be holding up, although that's mainly an incentiveissue. But we haven't seen a really severe hit to domesticconsumption since the stock market crash. What I'm worried about alittle is that we may not quite be seeing it yet but, given the factthat sales are running below what we anticipated them to be before thestock market crash, there's a little more downside risk, in my mind.I think some circumstantial evidence is that we have seen weak creditdemands in November. How you translate that, I don't know; but it'sthe first time in a while that we actually have had a decline inoverall credit demands for the month of November.I don't place a lot of emphasis on the aggregates but thefact that we are now projecting an actual decline in M1 growth inDecember, when we were hoping for an increase, is a little bothersome.I can't really explain it and I don't want to have just a knee-jerkreaction, but it bothers me that I can't rationalize it either. So Ithink there is some near-term risk, but I agree overall with thelonger-run view that we have to see consumption run lower than we havein the past to get the adjustment we need. I think the externaladjustment is taking place; exports look very strong, and evenadjusting out oil imports, non-oil imports don't look bad at all. Butmy concern is that things don't sneak up on us on the domestic demandside--that while we are expecting slow domestic demand and we are sortof looking the other way, the numbers go down sharply. I don't wantto get caught in that side of things. We do have to resist a strongexpansion in domestic demand or we have to have a very conservativeexpansion in that area or maybe even almost flat; but that's differentfrom a sharp decline. But, once again, I don't see the sales numberssharply weaker since the stock market crash. I'm worried more that wewent into that on the weaker side than we thought. That's sort ofwhere I am on the adjustment process. What I'm worried about, though,is that if we end up with a sharp downward reduction in consumption asthe adjustment mechanism, we're just simply going to replace privatesector demands for financing with public sector demands for financing,because we are going to see a huge swelling in the budget deficit.I'm not sure that our needs for foreign capital flows are going to-65-12/15-16/87improve under that adjustment process at all, substituting governmentfinancing needs for private financing needs. And the interest rateimplications of dependence on foreign sources of capital flows arepretty scary", "MR. HELLER. The optimism is also in contrast to what I wouldalmost call a barrage of visits and letters that have been coming inhere during the last couple of weeks and days. Curiously, many of theremarks by those representing the national associations--often of theindustries that some of you were talking about--were very much on thepessimistic side. Obviously, we have some problem here of looking atthe trees versus the forest. And, having lived off Coricidin for thelast three or four days, I really don't know how to sort it out. Icome down with Mike Prell, who says I see a lot of good things and Isee a lot of bad things, and I really don't know which way theevidence is pointing. But there is a marked contrast between theoptimism that seems to be being picked up in the anecdotal evidence12/15-16/87and the outlook that I would argue is not at all optimistic, accordingto the Greenbook. Also, if you look at some of the monetarystatistics, we have a real money supply that has been falling nowsince May, and reserves are flat. So, if all that optimism is outthere, I'm still curious why people don't hold that money. Those arealso some of the remarks I seem to be hearing, at least from our Deskpeople. They say, well, the demand for money just isn't there. So,I'm puzzled. Obviously, I hope it will turn out the way the vastmajority here describe it to be, but I think that there are a lot ofreasons for unease in that optimistic outlook, because I think some ofthe more macro forces may not be all that sanguine", "MR. KELLEY. Well, I'm glad to follow your speech, Bob,because I think I'm coming from very much the same place. I have someconcern, too, because I'm getting somewhat different reports than I'mhearing around the table this morning. In fact, the reports I'mhearing around the table this morning encourage me greatly from whereI was when I came in here. My suspicion is that we are getting thisadjustment, as Governor Angell suggests; and I also suspect that itmay be this very slow aggregate growth and reserve growth that BobHeller was talking about that's doing it. I'm not confident thatretailers are doing that well. The sales I hear about across thecountry--when they started and the extent of them--make me wonder howstrong things are. Indeed, there are a lot of reports coming in fromassociations that are not as strong as we are hearing here thismorning. Martha, you were quoting from I had a visit froman economic consultant who works with and this fellow istelling that the economy is going to fall off the cliff inthe first quarter on account of the growth in the aggregates. Thatmay be part of what's going into their planning. In short, Mr.Chairman, to go back to your analogy about plumbing and Bob Black'scomment on it, I wonder if the plumbing may not be beginning to workagain. In any event, I suspect it will work a while before we realizeit is working. Given that the retail economy is as important as it isto the overall picture, I think that we should be very alert to thestate of the plumbing--what the aggregates are doing and what effectsthat may be having. I would be very happy with the staff forecast for1988, and I basically agree with it. But that's where my concernabout it would lie", "MR. PARRY. Yes", "MR. HELLER. I'm essentially for \"B\" but a bit split as faras the timing is concerned, maybe along the lines that Bob Parry wasjust talking about. Through the year-end, and as long as the dollaris under pressure, I would stick to the fed funds rate at 6-3/4percent. If the pressure on the dollar eases, and once we get throughthe choppy weather of the year-end, I would switch more towards a (3)type policy with emphasis on the borrowing again. I would beasymmetrical in the easing direction, too, so that might allow the fedfunds rate to drop a bit. Probably a normal borrowing target of $300million would be appropriate for that", "MR. HOSKINS. I guess I'd go with alternative \"B\", with somereluctance, over the concern about the aggregates and the continualdownward revisions. That causes me some concern about going forward.Obviously, the optimism we see right now is related to some eventsthat have already happened, if we believe in lags. So, I'm concernedabout going forward. If we're going to look at an aggregate, I wouldtry to pay a lot of attention to M2 and whether we're going to get thegrowth there or not. If we get continued shortfalls in that, then I'dbe concerned more than I would be otherwise. I'd want to go withoption (4) if we're going to use the announcement. I don't see anyreason not to announce to the markets that we're making a change.We're sitting here looking for year-end cover and all that kind ofthing; it seems to me we can get where we want to be very quickly withless misinformation or miscues by making an announcement. If we're-74-12/15-16/87not going to do that, then I'd worry a little more about markets andgo with option (3)", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I have a multitude of problems. Myfirst problem is that, going back to the last meeting, I frankly didnot realize, or did not fully appreciate at the time of the meeting,how far we seem to have gone in terms of an operating strategy that sonarrowly pegs the federal funds rate, as indeed emerged over theperiod. It may be that I missed the nuances of the discussion, but Icertainly didn't view policy quite in that strict light of literallyresisting even one-eighth of a percentage point wiggles in the federalfunds rate. As I said yesterday, that approach to policy, even on avery short-term basis, is one that I find very, very troubling. So,on the strategy question, I would favor going back to (4) as fast as-77-12/15-16/87possible. I don't think I would condition that on a stablerelationship because there has never been one and never will be one.The whole idea is that part of what we're providing is room for themarket itself to play a role in the process. So, moving back to (4)promptly is something that I put some importance on. I don't want tobeat a dead horse here, but it seems to me that doing so at year-endis the perfect way to do it. The Chairman could say in testimony orin the question and answer [session] at the end of this week that weexpect, as always, some volatility or churning in the markets at year-end, so don't read any policy significance into it, because there'snone there. In my judgment, that provides the easiest way to get backto (4), but I think that is your call, Mr. Chairman. If you prefer todo it otherwise, I could live with (3) over the next couple of weeks.But getting stuck on something like what current policy has turned outto be would be a very big mistake, I think.As far as the basic thrust of policy is concerned, were itnot for the proximity to October 19th, I would actually favortightening policy right now on the grounds that I regard the currentexchange market situation as perilous. I recognize that there arerisks on both sides. The exchange market could trigger a blowout inthe stock market; or, the other way around, a blowout in the stockmarket could trigger a blowout in the exchange market. But what liesbeneath both of those concerns, at least in my judgment, is a greatdeal of agnosticism or skepticism or cynicism about the thrust of U.S.economic policy in general. And I don't think that is going to goaway very easily. However, I can't ignore October 19th, and I don'twant to throw out the baby with the bath water, so I could live withan alternative \"B\" that would have borrowings, depending upon what wewant to do with the strategy question, at $400 million, at least afterthe year-end. I would associate that with a federal funds rateroughly in the range of recent experience, but I would define recentexperience in somewhat broader terms than an eighth-of-a-point spread.On the language of the directive, I have no trouble with a directivethat is asymmetric toward easing in a context in which the pattern ofeconomic statistics is distinctly weak. On the other hand, I wouldstrongly favor a directive that is at least potentially asymmetric totighten if we run into another rout in the exchange market", "You could say that if your weakness--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I know [unintelligible]. In otherwords, it's not the list of items that we have to determine how we aregoing to behave; and we have both of those in the instructions", "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. In what sense do you mean. The wordsstill sensitive imply a bit more emphasis on certain fragilities.There are always uncertainties in the economic outlook. I don't thinkthe word uncertainties captures it. It is saying something different.I inferred from what I was hearing that there was no objection to thatremaining in, although a couple people did raise the question", " I wantto make certain that it wasn't inadvertence that--MR. ANGELL. Well, I didn't mention it and I would like itout", " For 3-1/2 years I've--CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If we were targeting federal funds, Iwould say that would be irrelevant. The trouble is that in thiscontext everyone is used to that language and I'm not sure they takeit very seriously any more. If we were to change it, it might be aslippery thing", " Well, as the Manager saw that that was consistentwith market conditions--MR. ANGELL. But you would be pursuing the borrowing as yourprimary operating strategy", "MR. MELZER. Could I ask a question. I had a similarquestion last time. How will the policy record reflect what happenedhere. I think some people interpret the $300 million as kind of wherewe were and as no change in policy; others interpret it as a change inpolicy in that we're moving the borrowing target down from $400million to $300 million, albeit under that flexibility arrangement.If somebody reads the policy record next time and the directive talksabout the existing degree of reserve restraint, where does it getmemorialized that the degree of reserve restraint was changed, if infact it was. How will that be read", "MR. KOHN. No, I don't think so, Governor Angell. Peter andI had extensive conversations on this, I would add, and we wereequally uncertain about it. But our presumption was that some, but-84-12/15-16/87not all, of the reluctance to borrow would go away because we stillwould have a sensitive economic environment. We would have the Bankof Boston situation and a lot of things going on which might makebanks a little reluctant to be seen at the discount window. So, ourpresumption was that $200 million was more appropriate now and thatwould rise to $300 million after the end of the year; but there wouldstill be a margin below the $400 million", "MR. JOHNSON. If we make it into what", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Do you mean if I had my druthers", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I don't care about the minutes", "MR. ANGELL. I would like to associate myself, as youprobably understand, with the remarks that Vice Chairman Corrigan justmade. I believe it's a high-risk approach. And I also believe that avery clear-cut policy on the part of the U.S. Government and theFederal Reserve would not require as much interest rate cost as weotherwise will have to bear. It would be more consistent with lowerinterest rates and faster money growth than our ignoring the exchangevalue of the dollar"]}
