{"2015FOMC20150128meeting.txt": [" MR. FISCHER.  Is there a second", " MR. FISCHER.  Any other nominations or discussion. We should try it out.  [Laughter] Without objection.  Now I\u2019d like to ask for a nomination for the position of Committee Vice Chair", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I\u2019d like to comment on the counterparty matter that Simon raised at the beginning of his remarks, as part of our conversation yesterday about this.  Clearly, the situation we had in the previous authorization wasn\u2019t ideal.  The term \u201cdealer\u201d is there for historical reasons.  It\u2019s not precisely defined.  It has a common-sense English language meaning, however, that I think is plausibly restrictive in the sense that there are some counterparties you could imagine that wouldn\u2019t qualify as dealers in the plain-English version of the meaning of the word.  So it seemed, at first blush, to be removing an important constraint on the Desk.  I totally trust the Desk not to expand the typical counterparties of open market operations and of repo and securities lending operations without consulting the Committee. I totally get that.  But my concern is that making this change with such short notice doesn\u2019t seem advisable.  So I\u2019d advocate that we do include the bracketed items.  The Committee needs a chance to understand what the implications are.  There\u2019s a study under way of the entire counterparty framework, and rationalizing how the authorization and other documentary devices of the Committee deal with counterparties would be a good thing.  But we should probably await that before we make any substantive change.   This is a substantive change that will appear to the public.  While it\u2019s not likely to be plastered over the front pages of many newspapers, there is a set of market participants who will take notice, wonder what this implies, and perhaps spend time speculating about what this implies about the Committee\u2019s intentions for the capability of expanding counterparties of the Desk\u2019s operations in the future.  So until we actually get through more work to understand this\u2014 and in view of the very short amount of time the Committee has had to digest these documents that were posted Friday evening\u2014I\u2019d urge that we retain the status quo by including the bracketed phrasing in the proposed directive. And I should mention that I fully support all of the other changes in the directive", " MR. LACKER.  Exactly.  I misspoke. CHAIR YELLEN. Let me ask if there are other comments on the matter that President Lacker has raised here. President Kocherlakota", " MR. POTTER.  Yes", " MR. LACKER. We\u2019re considering now the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive. Madam Chair, I will respectfully dissent once again from both of these, as I have every three years in the past and as my predecessor had going back to the 1990s.  Very briefly, the purpose of these facilities is to facilitate foreign exchange interventions undertaken at the behest of the U.S. Treasury.  Such intervention is ineffective if it does not signal monetary policy shifts.  If it does signal a shift in monetary policy, then it essentially compromises our independence.  Foreign exchange intervention is virtually nonexistent now.  I think we should take steps to wind down the infrastructure associated with it.In the meantime, though, I will respectfully dissent from the foreign currency authorization directives. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Are there other comments or questions. [No response]  Okay.  Hearing none, what I\u2019d like to do is, we need votes on these, and I would like to take them separately to record separate votes.  These are votes of Committee members.  First, let\u2019s start with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed", " MR. TARULLO.  As the changes have just been described, they seem fine, but I wanted to second Stan\u2019s observation on the blizzard of memos coming in on SDS late Friday night.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable, frankly, to send so many things at more or less the last minute when people are trying to prepare their remarks for the meeting.  So I would hope there would be some way that things could come in with enough time for those of us on the Board, at least, to be able to absorb everything. But that reservation doesn\u2019t go to the merits of this particular issue\u2014which I\u2019m fine with. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher", " MS. MESTER.  Okay.  Can I follow up on what President Lacker was saying.  Because I\u2019m a little confused about this, too", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I\u2019m pretty sympathetic to what you\u2019re saying, President Lacker, in the sense that, if the Committee decides determinatively that it\u2019s not going to use something, then it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep testing it, because that leads to the wrong inference by the markets.  But, at the same time, it\u2019s not unreasonable for the markets to see how well the tests do and, from how well the tests do, make inferences about how likely the Committee is to actually adopt that facility. It seems to me that one reason why the markets might think term RRPs were more likely was that the tests seemed to show that they were helpful in putting a floor under money market rates. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s reasonable to think that we could force the markets not to draw those kinds of inferences from whether the tests go well or the tests go not so well.  They\u2019re going to respond to how they see their experience with the test", " MS. LOGAN. We heard from market participants that some learning took place, and they realized\u2014as the operation, particularly the third one, wasn\u2019t oversubscribed\u2014that the year-end pressures were going to be fairly smooth.  But if you pressed market participants to indicate whether they were fully confident that all of the demand would have been met on the year-end   date with a larger overnight RRP cap, I\u2019m not sure they would have preferred the term over the overnight.  So when there\u2019s uncertainty about whether the cap is high enough to accommodate that demand on overnight, that\u2019s what you would be weighing against increased knowledge by having the term earlier", " MS. BRAINARD.  I would say, President Lacker, that you\u2019re making important analogies to previous periods that were completely different from the circumstances that we\u2019re going to be facing.  We are in uncharted territories, and market participants are going to be watching this with a different set of eyes because of the massive amount of excess reserves in the system and because we\u2019re lifting off from the zero lower bound, where we\u2019ve been for many   years now.  I just don\u2019t think we have historical examples of that in the United States.  Right now, we are getting support from the zero lower bound, but you\u2019ll be moving that lower bound up. The behavior we saw at quarter-end in September should lead us to be very concerned that, right after an announcement by this Committee that we\u2019re lifting off, we could actually see rates drifting down for several days in a row.  To me, that would be a very strong concern, particularly as we have the tools that we\u2019re quite confident could prevent it.  The following question would arise:  Why wouldn\u2019t you use those tools. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell", " MS. LOGAN. To me, the two situations depend entirely on how stable the overnight RRP take-up is.  As an example, if it was completely stable and the headroom didn\u2019t change, then moving some of it to term doesn\u2019t really add any benefit.  If the overnight RRP take-up is very variable and moves around a lot, then moving some of it to term can improve financial stability because that headroom can fluctuate quite a bit.  So I think it depends on your assumption about the stability of the daily take-up", " MR. ROSENGREN. To follow up, on your illustrative option 1 on page 2, the second bullet is assuming that the term reverse repo is the preferred way to snug up the rates.  The other option would be that the interest on excess reserves could be raised at that point.  The memo was looking at the spread prior to liftoff, but I\u2019m thinking more in terms of the situation after liftoff.  Rather than using the term, why couldn\u2019t we use IOER if we were finding that it was softer than we expected and make an adjustment at that point.  The memos seem to have a preference for term over adjustments with the IOER.  I just wanted to see if that was accurate or not, because I thought our initial high-level position was that we were going to rely primarily on IOER, and this seems to change that a little bit", " MR. POTTER. If the federal funds rate goes above 25 basis points, the directive says that the Desk has to take actions once that point is reached to try to push the federal funds rate back", " MR. POTTER. And the Committee has told us that you\u2019re going to raise rates\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019re not doing it", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think we should be confident that increasing the IOER is going to result in a sufficiently smooth rise in short-term market rates when we raise the target range for the funds rate.  That\u2019s my reading of the wide evidence we\u2019ve gotten from the Desk operations and everything we\u2019ve done so far.  I think we should stick withour plan to use the overnight RRP program as insurance only against the possibility that there\u2019s more slack, perhaps, in the relationship between IOER and market rates than we\u2019ve seen at any time over the past six years. Using it as a backstop means a relatively wide spread to IOER, so I support the staff\u2019s proposed spread of 25 basis points.  It\u2019s wider than anything we\u2019ve tested so far and, apart from quarter-ends, take-up has not exceeded $300 billion.  With a 25 basis point spread, I\u2019d expect significantly smaller take-up.  But in any event, I\u2019d be comfortable with a large cap at a 25 basis point spread.  So, $600 billion is the size suggested in option 1.  I wouldn\u2019t be against $800 billion or $1 trillion, just to be sure.  With such a large cap and a 25 basis point spread, I think we could be very confident that rates will be in that corridor.  I think we should just make the cap temporarily as large as it needs to be for us to be comfortable that we\u2019re going to be in that corridor.  I think that\u2019s the way to solve our problems. We\u2019re going to have volatility.  We could well have volatility on quarter-ends.  We always have had volatility on quarter-ends, and there probably always will.  The Desk has historically taken measures over quarter-end, back when we were in the old regime, to try to anticipate the shift in demand for reserves and to counteract that, but everyone recognized that that was a much more uncertain endeavor than off quarter-ends.  So markets realized that volatility\u2014sort of the forecast error of the funds rate\u2014was going to be exceptionally large over quarter-ends and recognized that it didn\u2019t pose a fundamental problem for monetary policy effectiveness.  And I think that\u2019s going to be the case now, even though quarter-end comes a week after one potential prominent liftoff date. On the strictly macroeconomic side of thinking about liftoff, I agree with others who made the argument that the path for the policy rate we take over time is going to be moreimportant than a particular date at which start raising rates.  For interest rate volatility, I think the behavior that interest rates display over the course of the month after liftoff is going to be much more consequential than what happens on the last day of June, if that\u2019s when we choose to lift off.  So I don\u2019t think one day\u2019s movement a couple of days after our liftoff should concern you. I think simplicity is a virtue, and, as I said, it is clear we can implement monetary policy without a term RRP program.  I think a term program might be tricky to introduce before a liftoff meeting without tipping our hand or signaling.  I think that\u2019s a delicate problem, but I suppose we could probably figure out a way to do that.  I don\u2019t think the alternative of making the program available now on a continuous basis is attractive because it would further encourage markets to believe that our whole RRP machinery, overnight and term, is more of a permanent feature of the financial landscape than I think we\u2019re intending. And as I said earlier, we face this tension between expectations getting out of control and wanting to learn some things, and I think we\u2019ve learned what we need to learn. It\u2019s pretty clear that the pressure on rates going into quarter-end is related to the probability that the overnight facility caps out at quarter-end and rates get driven down.  With a large enough cap, that concern should be minimal, and we\u2019re not likely to get any of the downward pressure leading into quarter-end that motivated the term RRP; the staff recognized this before we did the tests over the year-end.  So in the arguments made\u2014why not use the tool just in case, kind of a belt-and-suspenders approach\u2014I think we see and have seen that our rolling out of facilities like this on a sustained basis builds a constituency.  Building a constituency for a program makes it difficult or costly for us to contemplate pulling back, and I think we\u2019ve seen that in the primary dealer survey data that I talked about. So I would favor option 1, and I\u2019d be opposed to any further testing of term RRPs now.  I think we know enough about how they work.  I think rolling them out, if it seems warranted, in the weeks after we raise rates is the way to keep that extra capability in reserve.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019m happy to go along with the consensus of the room on the questions being posed by the staff.  It sounded to me like the consensus is building in support of option 1, with possibly even a higher cap, if needed.  I\u2019m comfortable going along with that.  I wanted to highlight some of the comments that I heard around the table as being ones that I felt particularly resonated with me.  I thought President Rosengren\u2019s question about international cash flows is one that I had not thought about and would be useful for the Committee to explore further. I thought President Mester\u2019s comment about emphasizing the temporary nature of what we\u2019re doing is really critical.  President Williams is right to highlight that we\u2019ve already made reference to the fact that we intend this facility to be temporary.  On the other hand, that September 2014 communication replaced a June 2011 communication.  So I think it would be useful for us to cement what we said in September in an ongoing fashion, especially if we go larger, because there might be a temptation to think that\u2019s going to mean we\u2019re going to go longer as well.  I think we just have to be clear in our communications, on an ongoing basis, that we intend this to be a temporary facility. A tension I heard along those lines is President Bullard\u2019s comment about timing: is liftoff really going to be special in some of the considerations we heard. Are we not always going to be concerned about, well, we\u2019ve got to get the interest rate in the range. And that led me to be very sympathetic to President Lockhart\u2019s question or suggestion that we explore and communicate clearly what we have in mind about an exit plan from this facility.  I think that would help bring clarity to our commitment to having this be a temporary facility. Overall, as I said, I\u2019m willing to be supportive of whatever consensus emerges from our discussion.  I guess the one point I\u2019ll close with, Madam Chair, is that in my own thinking, this conversation is premature.  The time is simply not right for liftoff.  As I\u2019ll explain in later go-rounds, the evolution of the data in the past six months means we should be discussing how to solidify the credibility of our inflation target.  We\u2019ve heard a lot of conversations about credibility already today.  I\u2019ll be talking about credibility as well, about the credibility of that   percent goal, and that means providing more accommodation, not less. So our topic, I think, should be turning more to how we can use tools to ease financial market conditions and bolster the credibility of that inflation target and less about how we plan to tighten in the near term.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I began this exercise, whenever we started talking about it months ago, with a strong set of financial stability concerns, which, unlike many of you, have not abated during the course of these discussions.  But it has become apparent to me over time\u2014and I think part of today\u2019s discussion was a reaffirmation of this point\u2014that the financial-stability difference between just ON RRP and a mix of ON RRP and term RRP is probably not that great relative to my source of concerns.  And I think President Lockhart and President Kocherlakota have put their finger on the source of my concerns, which is, as President Lockhart put it, an exit plan.  And I guess I disagree with Governor Fischer.  I think we\u2019d better think about an exit plan for a reason I\u2019ll explain in a minute. There are two ways that things could go here.  One, with a large-ish ON RRP, we begin liftoff at some point in the future, and it turns out that things go pretty smoothly, and the take-up is nowhere near the cap\u2014if there is a cap\u2014that we\u2019ve put in place.  And as President Plosser suggested, at the next meeting we can reduce the cap without any concerns about what happens.  A powerful message will be sent to the money market fund industry and, indeed, to everybody else. The other scenario is one in which it turns out that there is substantial take-up.  And in subsequent meetings, there is still concern that\u2014as Narayana was suggesting\u2014in the absence of the continued use of a very large ON RRP, there may be some difficulty in getting within the target range, or at least in having confidence that we\u2019ll be within the target range.  It seems to me   that this is the scenario to worry about.  I don\u2019t know what the probabilities are regarding that scenario.  I don\u2019t know that anybody could say with any great assurance even the order of magnitude for what the probabilities are, but I think they\u2019re nontrivial. And here is where the question of, as Dennis put it, the exit plan comes into play, because I think what we confront is a variant of a time-consistency problem: That is, at any given meeting, it always seems like the best thing is to make sure you hit the range with confidence with a big ON RRP facility, and any financial stability issue is speculative.  It\u2019s not around right now, of course, and is probably for tomorrow\u2019s Committee, not even the members who are on the Committee right now.  This is precisely why, in general, policymakers pay more attention to short-term issues and why long-term problems often don\u2019t get addressed\u2014because of the decision pressures that we all face. So I think, under those circumstances, there are two ways to deal with those longer-range contingencies.  One, which I\u2019m going to come back to in a second, is some variant on a commitment device\u2014that is, sort of an ex ante approach.  The second is having more options as you go forward, a kind of ex post approach. Several people have already stated why, notwithstanding their preference for option 1, they think it might be a good idea to continue to investigate, through testing and otherwise, other tools that may be available, and I would agree with them.  So my instinct would be to let the Desk test anything it thinks might be useful at some point to give us as an option. With respect to the first way\u2014that is, the commitment device\u2014the only thing I have heard, and I have heard it from almost everybody who has spoken to this point, \u201cWell, we said it\u2019s temporary.\u201d  Well, you know, this is what a time-consistency problem is defined by.  You have a stated policy, which of course is the preference.  But when you come to the point of making the decision, it turns out that that gets trumped by the shorter-term considerations, and that at some point other actors begin to figure out that that\u2019s the circumstance you\u2019re in. So stating that something is temporary, I don\u2019t think, in and of itself, can be hugely reassuring, even though it helps, and there is no question that it is better to say it and to say it repeatedly than not to say it. But I do think that other kinds of commitment devices should at least be thought about:  for example, whether there is some way to tie the maximum size of an ON RRP over time, even to the balance sheet, which may not change for quite some time, so that at least there would be a clear ending point.  I don\u2019t know what other ideas there are, and I think Governor Fischer is right in suggesting it\u2019s going to be hard to come up with them.  But I\u2019m left quite uncomfortable just relying on our saying, \u201cWell, it\u2019s temporary.\u201d And I heard many people say, \u201cAs appropriate, we would bring it down,\u201d or \u201cAs possible, we would bring it down.\u201d Well, what if that decision still seems a hard one. It then becomes hard to bring it down. The problem with a commitment device is that, of course, it puts a constraint on discretion.  That\u2019s the definition of a commitment device.  But you\u2019ve got to do it.  If you don\u2019t do it, and you\u2019re not willing to do it ex ante to some degree, then it suggests to me that we\u2019re not putting any value on financial stability considerations, which I think is different from saying we put dominant value on the precision of the monetary policy execution but are still placing some value on financial stability considerations. As I say, I can\u2019t value it, but it does seem to me that we don\u2019t want to have our children or somebody looking back at some point and saying, \u201cYou know, the Fed just slipped into this.  At every point, it was easier to make that decision.  They allowed this industry to get started, and then what happened. There was a major run circumstance in which everybody ran to the Fed, and their successors were sitting there saying, \u2018We\u2019d better increase the ON RRP. Otherwise,there\u2019s financial instability.\u2019\u201d  So that\u2019s why, whether you call it a decision tree as President Fisher suggests, or President Lockhart\u2019s exit plan, or just gaming it through\u2014I think which was what Narayana was suggesting\u2014I do hope that we can think more about this between now and March and see whether we can get beyond mere words with something ex ante, then allow Simon and Lorie to test a bunch of stuff that may help us develop some ex post options as needed later on. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you", " MR. FISHER.  I want to come back to a point I made before, and I think Governor Tarullo was endorsing it\u2014that old quip, \u201cTrust in Allah, but tie your camel.\u201d  I just want to make sure we have simplicity of liftoff, but that in our back pocket, we have done the studies.  And if it doesn\u2019t work the way we want it to work, we pull out these different tools, and that\u2019s what I call decision tree management. That was one point I was trying to make.  I think you agreed, Dan", " MR. POTTER. We could do some testing from late February to early March. CHAIR YELLEN.  Right.  So making it a relatively small scale, not at quarter-end, and I think a number of people felt this shouldn\u2019t be part of our liftoff toolkit. In fact, I heard pretty broad support for the view that we shouldn\u2019t use that tool at liftoff. Nevertheless, I did hear a number of you say that, ultimately, as we may want to reduce the cap over time on the overnight RRP facility, this is something that we might potentially want to use.  It\u2019s not clear we would use it, but if we did, it might be useful to test it to see. Governor Fischer", " MR. LACKER.  Yes, I\u2019d like to suggest that the staff give some thought to this\u2014and maybe this is just terminology.  You know, the Desk brings us a proposal for, say, the next round of testing, and I\u2019m continually asking about, all right, what\u2019s on the horizon after that.  On the horizon after that is the next quarter-end, which could be the consequential one.  Now, a couple of people around the table spoke of quarter-end term RRPs as something they want to initiate and just carry right through to liftoff, right.  So they want to have it in place and keep going.  Well, that suggests we\u2019re not really testing.  I mean, no one spoke about how compelling these research questions in the memo were.  Basically, people were thinking about whether they want term RRP to be in place from now until we lift off.  So this should raise in our minds the question of, when is it not testing and when is it a program. When is it official that it\u2019s not a test.  We may want to just hold in our minds that, all right, it\u2019s official, but we\u2019re going to call it testing until we lift off. I don\u2019t know, but I think it would be worthwhile for us to think about that before June, when it\u2019s upon us, or April, when we have to think about June testing.  CHAIR YELLEN.  I think that\u2019s correct", " MS. GEORGE.  I assume it would be less, though, under those.  My other question is on the conclusions that the report draws.  The measures of cyclical vulnerabilities look fairly reassuring. But it\u2019s not as clear to me how I should think about the state of structural vulnerabilities and how you evaluate those relative to those conclusions in there.  And in the  report, it talks about that as being an important limitation of your ability to quantitatively measure risk to the financial system.  So my question is, really, how do you incorporate those here. In view of all of the reforms and changes that may be under way, where do you gauge structural vulnerability, or how should I think about it in relation to the conclusions that you\u2019ve drawn here", " MR. EVANS. Right.  Thank you.  I think that\u2019s an example of why these simple rules can often keep us well away from our goals because we\u2019re holding to a rule like that, when all of a sudden there\u2019s something else going on that\u2019s unusual historically.  We ought to offer some additional accommodation; or that\u2019s my interpretation of that.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard", " MR. WILCOX.  Well, I hate to send President Fisher out on a disappointing note, but I\u2019m a little skeptical about our ability to do that.  That would be a pretty thoroughgoing exercise because we\u2019d have to recalibrate our models.  This would not be a simple undertaking. The implications of that, I think, would run fairly deep through the structure of the model.  I don\u2019t want to be encouraging about that", " MR. EVANS.  Well, 11 out of 12 were deflated.  That\u2019s not documented", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The 10th District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  The effects of the decline in oil prices have, on net, been favorable, with nearly 50 percent of firms in our manufacturing and services surveys reporting a positive effect on their business, while around 20 percent report a negative effect.  Of course, District states that are most dependent on energy production\u2014Wyoming, Oklahoma, and New Mexico\u2014 face a somewhat less favorable outlook. Oil rig counts have started to decline rapidly, and capital spending is expected to be down considerably in 2015.  Based on our quarterly energy survey, nearly half of respondents expect more than a 20 percent reduction in capital spending this year.  Significant layoffs are already being announced at some District energy firms, and more are expected.  Analysis of hedging and debt positions shows that firms headquartered in the 10th District, which account for about one-third of all large independents, are comparable to other U.S. shale oil firms but with sizable differences across those firms.  In general, the smaller firms are more highly leveraged, but also better hedged, than the large firms.  Although most states now rely considerably less on the oil   and gas extraction sector than 30 years ago, it is possible that energy-dependent states like Oklahoma could experience double-digit percentage declines in energy sector jobs, and perhaps slight declines in overall employment. For the nation as a whole, my outlook for economic activity is little changed from the previous meeting.  Weaker foreign economic growth and a stronger dollar may weigh on GDP, but lower energy prices, on net, should provide a boost.  As a result, I continue to anticipate moderate growth of around 3 percent this year.  Consumer spending was strong in the second half of last year, and consumers\u2019 assessments of current economic and labor market conditions have brightened.  I expect low oil prices and further labor market improvements to provide ongoing support to household spending. The labor market has maintained its momentum, and my outlook for further improvement is optimistic based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s labor market conditions indicators, which showed that the level of activity improved again in December, and its momentum rose to its highest level over the past two decades.  Of particular note, among the 24 labor market variables that are used to construct this index, the five strongest contributors to improvement over the past six months are predominantly leading indicators\u2014a rise in the quits rate, a decline in those working part time for economic reasons, improved job flows from unemployment to employment, an increase in the percent of firms planning to increase employment, and a shift downward in the Blue Chip unemployment rate forecast. In an environment of above-trend economic growth and falling unemployment, of course, inflation remains low. Clearly, lower oil prices and the stronger dollar will exert some downward pressure in the near term, but these are relative-price movements that should prove temporary and not affect the longer-term inflation outlook.  For this reason, the recent decline in   market-based measures looks puzzling, as others have discussed, and I agree that this is a development that we will need to watch. While inflation is running below our stated quantitative objective, it is less clear to me at this point that the goal of price stability over the longer run is at risk.  Furthermore, I do not think we can judge the cost of low inflation in isolation from other economic developments.  Inflation below target in an environment of above-trend economic growth and falling unemployment seems less of a concern to me than low inflation combined with slowing economic growth and rising unemployment.  As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, my forecast implies that inflation will move upward, and spare capacity and tightening of labor markets will gradually lift inflation back toward target.  So unless signs emerge that the economy\u2019s performance is faltering, I see no need to delay normalization for the purpose of accelerating a return to 2 percent.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This will be fairly easy for me, because a number of people have already said most of what I wanted to say.  I\u2019ll just make a few points. One, I obviously agree with everybody that general improvement has continued since the previous meeting.  I\u2019d just observe in passing that it was a very damaged economy that needed a lot of improvement.  And because, with the exception of a couple of quarters, the pace of that improvement has never been all that rapid, I, again, don\u2019t think it proves too much to say we\u2019re continuing to improve. Second, and I did check with President Kocherlakota over the weekend to make sure he was going to address inflation so that I\u2019d be able to piggyback on his comments, but happily I can now piggyback on what Presidents Rosengren and Evans said as well.  I guess I\u2019m probably slightly different\u2014although maybe not too different from where President Evans is\u2014in saying I regard this as a downside risk rather than as a modal expectation.  But it\u2019s a very troubling one, if it were to be realized.  And, again, as a noncentral banker and a nonmacroeconomist by training in most of my professional life, I continue to be bemused by the concept of anchored inflation expectations.  I mean, it does seem to me that an awful lot depends on anchored inflation expectations.  I notice in the current Tealbook, for example, that the staff models downplay the decline in TIPS compensation precisely because the surveys suggest that expectations remain  anchored, therefore it all must be okay.  An awful lot of work is being required of a factor that, so far as I can tell, is still not particularly well understood\u2014that is, where it comes from and how it actually functions. That just makes me slightly nervous, but it doesn\u2019t seem to make most of you nervous.  So I don\u2019t know what to make of that. And then, finally, on labor markets, I want to pick up on something a couple of people alluded to, and then Bill elaborated and actually began to try to quantify some, which is the possibility that the natural rate is lower than the estimates most of us, including the Tealbook, have.  And this is obviously really important, because, as I understand it, any significant difference in the natural rate plugged into any one of the various models that are used results in a quite different timing of liftoff and differences in what you do with regard to monetary policy thereafter. I\u2019m not about to argue something that I necessarily believe to be the case, but I just want to supplement some of the things Bill mentioned as potential points that may argue for the possibility that the natural rate is lower.  To some degree, the possibility that the natural rate is lower is the flip side of the low labor force participation rate relative to what we would have expected with demographic trends, which is to say, lower, but not as low as it has been.  That is, people who are currently categorized as unemployed may be more attached to the workforce and more skilled than the norm for unemployed workers historically.  In addition, a lot of people who would have formerly been listed as unemployed, but who are actually less tied to or qualified for work, may now be listed as out of the labor force.  And, by the way, there are a bunch of younger people who have parked themselves in school somewhere, waiting for things to improve.  Now, that\u2019s an intuition to some degree, or a theoretical possibility, but it is buttressed by the fact that, contrary to expectations, the exit rate from unemployment to out of the labor force has actually   fallen relative to what it was pre-crisis, and entry into the labor force\u2014again, taking demographics into account\u2014has been low.  So all of that would at least suggest, though not prove, that the quality, if you will, of those currently listed as unemployed is higher than the group historically included in that category of unemployment, and, therefore\u2014no pun intended\u2014naturally, there would be a lower natural rate.  Maybe that\u2019s not true, but here, as with so many things with respect to labor markets I\u2019ve been noticing for the past several years, every argument on one side, like on the issue of whether wages are about to rise, almost always has an equally good argument on the other. The NFIB thing is my latest example.  The NFIB survey predicts wages are going to rise.  It has been doing so for the past two years.  Someday it\u2019s going to be right.  But it hasn\u2019t been to date, and so to me it doesn\u2019t actually mean all that much.  Again, things like the quits rate\u2014yes, the quits rate has improved, but (a) it improved really only modestly, (b) it is still not where it was pre-crisis, and (c) it actually dipped back down a little bit during Q4.  So, again, let\u2019s not make too much out of things until we actually see something a bit more tangible, which I would come back to and say would be wages again.  And I\u2019m not going to discuss the implications of this, Madam Chair, because I think that\u2019s what the next go-round is about.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  I believe you\u2019re right.  Thank you.  Governor Powell", " MR. LACKER.  But how do you know that.  That depends on what those other term markets are, not where the one-week is relative to the overnight.  That depends on how other term rates move, right", " MR. LACKER.  That\u2019s unpersuasive. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher", " MR. LACKER.  Yes, I\u2019m opposed. CHAIR YELLEN. For the March quarter-end", " MR. LACKER.  Yes", " MR. LAUBACH.  May I quickly respond to President Kocherlakota. I\u2019m a little afraid that what you laid out might sound a little bit like double counting.  The way that monetary policy transmission largely works both in the staff projection and in the FRB/US model is through longer-term interest rates. Now, that\u2019s how the term-premium effects that we are still assuming, and that are shown toward the end of Tealbook B, figure in.  For any given path for the federal funds rate, current and future, longer-term interest rates do reflect these term premiums.  Insofar as the rule mechanically responds to current conditions, these current conditions will be stronger simply because longer-term interest rates are lower than they would be for the same path of the short-term rate if the balance sheet didn\u2019t continue to exert downward pressure on term premiums", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On this topic, there\u2019s a completely different way to characterize accommodative policy.  You can do it with regard to whether we\u2019re achieving our goals in an environment in which the unemployment rate is still higher than the natural rate and inflation over the forecast is underrunning our goal.  You could say it\u2019s not really accommodative enough. But at any rate, I have a question about the proposed statement on page 2. The proposed paragraph 3 includes the phrase:  \u201cBased on its current assessment, the Committee judges that economic conditions,\u201d et cetera, et cetera.  My question basically is whether this an unusual usage of this phrase because it\u2019s singular, as if there\u2019s only one assessment of the Committee.  It strikes me that that\u2019s not unusual at a point when we are making a decision to change policy, like taking an action to change the funds rate.  But when we\u2019re contemplating a future action in a couple of meetings and we say \u201cthe Committee\u2019s assessment,\u201d I\u2019m wondering, how narrow this is.  If you don\u2019t quite agree with that assessment, then you\u2019re going to get into discussions about the appropriate conditionality. But it strikes me that, because of the future aspect of this, it would be better to somehow try to characterize the likelihood of that assessment or to use something slightly more probabilistic, the central tendency of that. I guess my question is, doesn\u2019t this sound a little unusual in its current usage. It led me to add a different modifier in my own formulation", " MR. LACKER.  Great", "MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Though the discussion about moving sooner or later is about balancing risk, I see it as somewhat neglecting that we have already built risk-management considerations into our decision about liftoff.  As the Board memos discuss, nearly all of the standard rules we use to evaluate policy have already called for liftoff.  In addition, the real federal funds rate has been below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* for about a year.  Analysis by my staff also assesses to what extent the period in which policy was constrained from being sufficiently accommodative due to the zero lower bound has been offset during the recent period when the funds rate has been held below prescriptions from an estimated policy rule.  They find the cumulative shortfall of accommodation earlier in the recovery has been more than offset by the subsequent cumulative excess accommodation. These factors suggest to me that the Committee has effectively already made a decision to move later and assume the associated risk rather than move in line with prescribed policy rules. In terms of the specific questions, I see liftoff in the middle of this year, which is in line with current expectations, and at a gradual pace consistent with a data-dependent approach and one that balances risks.  Waiting for liftoff until we reach full employment and inflation of 2 percent does not seem appropriate, particularly with an elevated balance sheet that continues to provide accommodation.  The temptation to see one more data point will always be present. History shows this can lead central banks to move too late.  Because of the lags we face in monetary policy, we likely will need to move before full attainment of our objectives. Alternatively, the risk of moving even later than in the middle of the year is that we may fall behind the curve and would need to move rates up more quickly. Of course, a rapid increase in rates could surprise financial markets and pose risks to financial stability.  Along these lines, I found the Board staff memo assessing the likelihood ofthese various events useful, though as the memo itself points out, the scenarios do not take into account reputation risk or financial-stability concerns.  Still, the combined likelihood of one of the adverse scenarios occurring was higher in the later and steep scenario than under the early and gradual scenario.  Also according to the simulations, the early and gradual approach effectively takes off the table a scenario in which we would have to raise rates aggressively. In terms of what developments I\u2019d like to see, I\u2019m a bit hesitant about drawing any bright lines regarding conditions that I\u2019d have to see before liftoff, and I thought the Chair\u2019s set of criteria from the December press conference was reasonable in that regard.  Further progress in labor market conditions along with confidence that inflation would be moving back to target are sufficient in my mind to consider liftoff.  I\u2019m also willing to look through some soft readings on near-term inflation rates.  Of course, I\u2019ll also be listening to anecdotes received from business contacts to confirm or contradict issues of wage and price pressures and stability in the price of oil.  Appreciation of the dollar and five-year, five-year-ahead inflation breakevens will also be important to that confidence. Regarding statement language, I\u2019m generally comfortable with the suggested language in the Board staff memo.  It highlights that March is going to be an important decision point, and if I look at my current outlook, removing \u201cpatient\u201d would be appropriate in March.  Given the emphasis on data dependence, we will clearly calibrate those first paragraphs of the statement to reflect any change in the outlook.  If the data soften, these paragraphs can convey a shift in the outlook, which will presumably cause expectations to adjust, but overall I see removing \u201cpatient\u201d as giving us flexibility around the timing of liftoff.  Alternatively, if we keep it in this March statement it will most like push expectations back and limit our flexibility. Finally, I support President Mester\u2019s proposal for recalibrating our statement, and, as others have noted, would welcome further discussion of that. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher", " MR. TARULLO.  You look discouraged", " MR. POWELL.  No, I realize that.  You\u2019re right.  I am taking it as a given, for purposes of this comment, that we have four press conferences a year and that this is going to be a June event or a September event, President Bullard.  If we had chosen some time ago to have press conferences at a bunch of these meetings, it would be a different situation, but we didn\u2019t make that choice", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My views on the most likely path of appropriate policy over coming meetings have not changed much since 11:00 a.m.  I had December in there in my original draft.  I think April might not be too soon for liftoff in the sense that if I had to put a probability on appropriate liftoff, it wouldn\u2019t be zero for April, but I understand the argument of many that the difference between April and June isn\u2019t as important as the path after liftoff.  As much as I\u2019d enjoy seeing you conduct an additional press conference, Madam Chair, and I do support President Bullard\u2019s suggestion, I don\u2019t see one meeting as a reason to dissent.  I can support removing \u201cpatient\u201d from the statement right now. But, absent convincing evidence that inflation expectations have become dislodged or that the real growth outlook is at heightened risk of deteriorating, I doubt very much that in March I\u2019ll see any reason for assigning a zero probability to an appropriate liftoff in June.  I doubt I\u2019ll find it appropriate not to drop \u201cpatient\u201d in March.  Data could come in differently, but that\u2019s how I feel.  It would constitute essentially pushing everything back until September, and I wouldn\u2019t see a rationale for that unless data are very surprising. Regarding foreign economic outlook, I agree with Presidents Williams, Mester, Plosser, and Bullard, and I don\u2019t support adding it to paragraph 2.  Paragraph 3 is the wrong place for it for reasons that others have said.  It\u2019s about our policy assessment.  I\u2019d support adding it somehow in paragraph 1, but given the hour, I\u2019d suggest we defer it. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Fischer", "   MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the statement as written, except for moving the reference to international developments to paragraph 3.  I\u2019ve given a lecture on what we do about foreign developments, and I\u2019ve told everybody we actually follow them closely and take them into account as they affect the domestic economy\u2014always emphasized\u2014and as relevant to our mandate.  I think it\u2019s kind of ridiculous not to put it in on the grounds that the Treasury makes decisions on the exchange rate.  Well, good for them, but we look at what they do, and that\u2019s all that this says.  I don\u2019t see what the problem is in putting it in here. The problem with putting it in paragraph 1, which is where I also tried, is we make a judgment on everything in paragraph 1.  We say it\u2019s either good or bad, it\u2019s developing this way, it\u2019s developing that way, and what would we have said on Europe.  Taking note of recent decisions in Europe, we take heart from the situation.  Well, we don\u2019t comment on what other central banks do, and so that was what the problem was with putting it in paragraph 1. We can\u2019t make a purely factual statement in paragraph 1. At least I couldn\u2019t find one, and I\u2019m sure a lot of other people tried.  We couldn\u2019t find one that would be purely factual and didn\u2019t seem to be making a judgment\u2014it would be a favorable judgment, but once you start making judgments, you\u2019re going to end up making judgments in the future.  I didn\u2019t find a way of doing it, and I think it\u2019s very difficult to do it. With this change, I support alternative B.  I will not fall on my sword if we lose, but I think it belongs in there and I think it\u2019s relevant.  As I listen to the morning news, the dollar and its effect on the United States is getting a lot of attention.  I opened a newspaper that I happened to read, and it\u2019s all over the front page.  We were the people, apparently, who didn\u2019t notice any of this, because we don\u2019t comment on these things.  Well, I don\u2019t think that makes a lot of sense. I think we\u2019ve got to put it in somewhere.   Let me make one point of interest.  I find it ironic that the dual-mandate central bank finds the most useful description of its current behavior, which many people appear to want, to be that of an inflation targeter.  If you look at those simulations that people like, they\u2019re ones which put all the weight on inflation in the utility function.  It\u2019s interesting that it turns out to be that way today just because we always thought of inflation targeting as coming from the top and not from the bottom.  Anyway, I support alternative B, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.  Governor Tarullo", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that the recent data on real activity have been favorable, and so I think it\u2019s appropriate to see the stronger description of the labor market and real activity.  I think the language on inflation compensation is very important, so I\u2019m glad to see that it\u2019s in there. On this question of how to capture developments in the global economy, I think we have been following a very puzzling pattern of not talking about it in the statement and having the minutes do all the work.  I think that\u2019s the wrong approach to be taking.  If you look at the forecasts, the amount of dollar appreciation and weakening of foreign economic growth that we have already seen have materially influenced our forecasts, both through core import prices and through net export channels.  It\u2019s substantial, it\u2019s material, it\u2019s persistent, and that\u2019s even afterthis adjustment was made to reduce the multiplier.  I think, as Governor Fischer said, it does affect our assessment of conditions in the U.S. economy.  I think we should try to capture it from that perspective.  I also agree that we don\u2019t want to suggest that uncertainty has increased somehow.  I think we could find a way of doing it in paragraph 2.  Let me make a suggestion.  We could say, \u201cWhile recognizing continued headwinds from the global economy.\u201d That doesn\u2019t say anything about the ECB\u2019s action.  It just recognizes the reality that we are facing continued headwinds from the global economy. I also think the Governor Fischer\u2019s suggestion of a modification to the subsequent paragraph is appropriate.  Again, I think it does affect our monetary policy deliberations, and I think I have as high sensitivities as anyone in this room as to how we work on international diplomacy surrounding exchange rates.  I think both modifications are very appropriately cautious and do not directly address the exchange rate, as I think we should not do.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  With inflation running well below our objective and the outlook abroad still very uncertain, it\u2019s not time to signal that liftoff is likely at one of the next two meetings.  In terms of timing, I\u2019m still inclined toward June rather than later, but my probabilities attached to June have slipped a bit, as the declines in both actual inflation and market-based measures of inflation compensation have become more significant.In our public comments, though, I still would very much like to keep June on the table, because the gap between our own views and what is priced into markets is already quite large, and I don\u2019t want that gap to grow any larger.  I\u2019m worried, basically, that there\u2019s this very large gap and we\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, we can\u2019t move because the markets will react very, very violently.\u201d  That\u2019s not a good situation to be in\u2014one in which monetary policy is constrained because of our fears that financial market conditions will react too violently to what we do.  I think we very much want to keep June on the table in terms of market expectations.  In terms of the language, I\u2019m happy to accept the suggested changes to paragraphs 2 and 3 on the international side. Finally, let me just, as the Vice Chairman, say a few things about Richard Fisher and Charlie Plosser\u2019s contributions to this Committee.  I think it\u2019s fair to say, speaking for myself, we didn\u2019t always agree on everything.  But when we agreed, you were very worthy allies.  When we disagreed, you were very worthy opponents.  I very much appreciate your contributions, as everyone else around this table does, to the Federal Reserve and your commitment to public service.  I think that your willingness to test and challenge the conventional wisdom was very valuable, and I think it shows the value\u2014this is something that Chairman Bernanke used to talk about a lot\u2014of having a monetary policy set by a Committee, with individuals of diverse backgrounds and views.  I know that even when I didn\u2019t agree with you at times, what you had to say made me think much harder, and very much contributed greatly to the quality and debate of this Committee. Thank you both for your service. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I think the issue we need to decide is how to deal with \u201cinternational,\u201d and we have two suggestions on the table.  I\u2019ll start with Governor Brainard\u2019s; she suggests replacing the bracketed \u201calthough\u201d with \u201cwhile recognizing continued headwinds from the global economy.\u201d Let me ask if there is any support for that change as opposed to   adding \u201cinternational.\u201d Okay.  I\u2019m not seeing a broad range of support.  I know it\u2019s late in the day to be doing this. Okay.  Then, I think I\u2019ve heard widespread support to get rid of the bracketed language in paragraph 2\u2014so I propose doing that\u2014and a diversity of views on whether to add \u201cinternational\u201d in paragraph 3.  I think my own view on this is that foreign developments are playing a major role in our assessment of the economy.  It will be noticed.  I\u2019m not quite sure how it will be interpreted, but adding that word doesn\u2019t involve taking a view on whether things are more or less uncertain.  There are a range of things we\u2019re taking account of\u2014oil prices, the dollar, the global economic outlook in different parts of the world, geopolitical developments.  It\u2019s in a sentence that says our assessment of our progress takes into account a lot of different things.  To me, it\u2019s relatively innocent and could stay there for a long time.  It\u2019s not the kind of addition that puts us in a position of asking, \u201cWhat do we do next time we have to modify it in some way.\u201d  At least to my own mind, Governor Fischer\u2019s suggestion is well within the acceptable range, but I certainly did hear concerns about adding anything at this point that would focus on international developments or be a change that we would be forced to live with.  I guess what I\u2019m going to do is ask for a show of hands. Who would be in favor of adding \u201cinternational\u201d"], "2015FOMC20150318meeting.txt": [" MR. POTTER.  Market participants freely give you a lot of viewpoints on how the Federal Reserve is doing.  And some of them do express some skepticism about the 2 percent inflation goal, if that answers your question", " MR. LACKER.  I believe it\u2019s the case that it\u2019s a theoretical possibility, in the uncapped scenario, if every counterparty bid their limit, the bids would aggregate to more than reserve account balances right now.  I believe you alluded to that fact, Jane.  So, what would we do", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think you\u2019re doing a partial equilibrium analysis.  In general equilibrium, the flowing of all these funds into the overnight RRP is going to have an effect on money market rates, and that is going to prevent the funds from flowing into the overnight RRP.  It can\u2019t be that you can just drain $4 trillion of reserves from the system and not expect money market rates to rise, something that would prevent this outcome.  I really think it\u2019s impossible", " MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a less extreme tail event than President Lacker.  Let\u2019s suppose at the time of liftoff that the cap is binding, so the federal funds rate is trading substantially below the target that we publicly announced.  We have two options.  We can either change the IOER rate, which would be a Board of Governors decision, or we can raise or eliminate the cap on ON RRP.  So either we have to have an emergency meeting of the FOMC  that night, or the Board of Governors has to have a formal meeting to decide if the IOER rate goes up.  Let\u2019s say that we decide to do the IOER, but we don\u2019t really understand what the spread is between IOER and ON RRP. After the Board has raised the IOER, we find out that\u2019s not sufficient either.  So then, following that, we have to eliminate or raise the cap on RRP. What do we think the market\u2019s reaction to the degree of uncertainty that the Federal Reserve has around this action would be.  We seem to be viewing this as an innocuous event.  I guess thinking about the decision trees\u2014whether we do ON RRP or whether we do IOER and how the market reacts in that context\u2014it seems, from a risk-management standpoint, it\u2019s highly risky to have a cap and have no certainty whether it\u2019s binding or not versus no cap, at least at initiation.  Could you tell me a little bit more about the costs and benefits as you think about the benefits of that cap and think about what happens if there actually is much more demand. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to exceed the amount of reserves, but I think it could exceed $800 billion.  I think the likely behavioral actions around this time are highly uncertain.  I hope it\u2019s much less than $800 billion, but I have no certainty about any of our estimates of that.  If it\u2019s not binding, both no cap and the cap have the same result, but if it is binding, there\u2019s a very different sequence of events, and it\u2019s unclear how our plan is to react to that.  Can you talk a little bit more about that cost-benefit calculation", " WILLIAMS.  Sure.  Actually, can I, in answering your question\u2014I feel as if I am a lawyer\u2014go back to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans from September 17, which states: \u201cDuring normalization, the Federal Reserve intends to use an overnight reverse   repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate.  The Committee will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.\u201d So we have already said those things very strongly and very clearly.  Then, in the new addition, it says that we will \u201c[a]llow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to be temporarily elevated to support policy implementation.\u201d  The issue associated with using \u201cfairly soon\u201d is that I think it is, first of all, unnecessary, in view of these very clear existing statements about our intentions and related things. It is really about this \u201cfairly soon\u201d being interpreted as being in terms of weeks or even a month or two, and having this time dimension when, really, I think our discussion is around the economics of this and what is actually happening with usage. Now, I think that there is a way to fix this.  Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned that he didn\u2019t have a replacement.  It could be that we could just have in that first sentence something to the effect of \u201callow the aggregate capacity of the repo facility to be temporarily elevated as needed to support policy implementation,\u201d or something that may be stronger than that.  It\u2019s the \u201cfairly soon\u201d that I think could be misinterpreted, not only in the way you\u2019re talking about, which is just logically lowering it from infinite to $1 trillion or something, but really more a misinterpretation that we are going to bring it back to a low level fairly soon.  That is my concern. CHAIR YELLEN. Can I just say that this exact language of \u201cfairly soon\u201d comes directly from the previous minutes.  The public, or those interested in this topic, are already familiar with these words.  And, you know, if we include it, the minutes of this meeting would probably indicate that a number of you have commented on essentially what you mean by \u201cfairly soon.\u201d There would consequently be a little bit more detail in the minutes about what this means", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As I listened to the discussion around the table, I heard a wide range of what \u201cfairly soon\u201d meant being expressed.  President Dudley talked about six weeks.  I\u2019m happy with six weeks, but I also heard people talk about six months.  Those are pretty big discrepancies in what \u201cfairly soon\u201d would mean.  So I will offer up again my preferred language, which is more bland than President Fisher would like, but here it is:  \u201cThe Committee expects to reduce the available capacity of the facility at an appropriate time after it commences policy firming.\u201d  I think it gets away from, if you are asked a question, what the time frame is.  Well, it depends on the conditions.  That is what \u201cappropriate\u201d means.  So I will offer that as a suggestion", "\u201d   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I see. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So let\u2019s go to the proposed March minutes language and see if we can reach agreement, and there are several issues outstanding.  First of all, President Kocherlakota proposed a change in the opening paragraph, in which it says, \u201cthe operational approach the FOMC will use,\u201d to \u201cintends to use.\u201d  And, in the subsequent sentence, you also proposed replacing \u201cwill\u201d with \u201cintends to.\u201d  Can I ask, is there anyone who would be unhappy if we change \u201cwill\u201d to \u201cintends to\u201d in both places. [No response]  Okay.  So let\u2019s make that change in both places, from \u201cwill\u201d to \u201cintends.\u201d And now we have the final sentence of the third bullet point.  On this, we have views on both sides.  I guess our options are keep it as is and leave \u201cfairly soon\u201d in, or, I suppose the alternative you would see, Governor Tarullo, would be to remove the sentence entirely", " MR. TARULLO. Well, if we are, then I am opposed to the facility, I think, because that suggests, again, that it is going to be used\u2014it is the instrument\u2014which is the direction in which we have been headed.  And, I think the \u201cappropriate time\u201d language, or the \u201cas to the extent necessary,\u201d reinforces the sense that it is ON RRP that is going to get us monetary policy control. That is why I am worried about the language.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s your intention, but I\u2019m afraid that is the way it\u2019s going to be read", " MR. POTTER.  The quality of what we come up with might be variable, though. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. It was pretty evenly divided", "\u201d MR. FISCHER. What was the total number of votes.  I had the sense that we had more than 10 voting on that one.   CHAIR YELLEN.  I think I counted, one more person in favor of keeping it than removing it", " MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, the second sentence in the third bullet doesn\u2019t make sense to me.  I think it may be used to be a bullet and then got moved to become part of the sentence. If we\u2019re going to redo this, why don\u2019t we also redo that.  I didn\u2019t know we were going to get so precise on the language of the minutes", " MR. FISCHER.  You mean actually worry about grammar. CHAIR YELLEN. What\u2019s wrong with the second sentence", " MR. POWELL.  May I just add one thing.  If you preannounce that you\u2019re going to waive the cap, which I don\u2019t think we should do\u2014 CHAIR YELLEN.  I thought we weren\u2019t going to do that.  I thought the plan was that we would not preannounce waiving the cap", " MR. LACKER.  As I noted earlier, I\u2019m going to decline to support term testing.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. Then let me put forward option 2 testing of authorizing term RRPs at quarter-ends through the end of the year.  Do we need to vote on this", " MR. TARULLO.  Flat. Against the dollar", " MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Let\u2019s put it this way.  They\u2019ve already been doing appreciation, but if they basically wanted less broad, real trade-weighted appreciation than they have now been getting, then, if the dollar continued to rise at its previous pace, they would have to depreciate against the dollar more strongly in order to make that happen.  Right now their trade-weighted RMB has appreciated very strongly because they\u2019re following the dollar up", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In the intermeeting period, we talked to a wide range of contacts in the Ninth District about compensation pressures.  Overall, the unemployment rate in the District is now below 4 percent, markedly below where it was in late 2006.  Indeed, in the twin cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, which has more than one-third of the economic activity in the District, the unemployment rate is close to 3 percent. Nonetheless, other than in a few specific occupations and locales, compensation pressures remain, at best, moderate in the District, with wage increases typically reported to be in the 2 to 3 percent range. Why are wage pressures so constrained.  Labor leaders we talked to attributed the relatively low compensation pressures to increased post-recession risk aversion on the part of workers.  Consistent with the implications of bargaining theory, they report that this risk aversion reduces the bargaining power of workers relative to firms. For their part, business leaders reported being flush with liquidity, but they saw many other ways to use those resources, like capital expenditure, rather than paying workers. We saw these stories from both sides of the table as largely consistent with each other.  Other than in a few specialties, businesses continue to be able to find the workers that they want without paying them a lot. Let me turn to the national economy.  In terms of prices, as in December, my inflation outlook remains subdued.  Under the monetary policy stance assumed in Tealbook, Book A, I don\u2019t see inflation returning to 2 percent until late 2018.  The behavior of market-based measures of inflation expectations continues to be a matter of significant concern.  The five-year, five-year-forward measures remain near historical lows. We also closely track the two-year, three-year measures, and these, too, are near historical lows.  In my view, participants in these markets appear to be putting nontrivial weight on an event in which economic activity and prices are both unduly low because the central bank is unwilling or unable to provide appropriate accommodation.  This is a signal that low inflation and the low-inflation outlook has reduced the credibility of the inflation target. Turning to the real side of the economy, my outlook for economic growth has weakened somewhat since December.  I now expect that the economy will grow about 2.7 percent in 2015.  This growth should be sufficiently fast to deliver a further modest decline in the unemployment rate by the end of the year.  I do expect this decline in the unemployment rate will be associated with an increase in labor input as measured by per capita employment and per capita hours.  We may also start to see some upward pressure on labor compensation.  But, as I just noted, nominal wage growth, and compensation growth more generally, remain very subdued, even in the relatively healthy labor market of the Ninth District. Overall, I expect the gratifying improvement in labor market outcomes that we saw in 2014 to continue.  It is important, though, to keep this improvement in perspective: 2014 was one good year, following four disappointing years in the labor market.  In the context of a very subdued inflation outlook, I believe that we should be doing what we can to deliver more years like 2014.  We should not be trying to use our tools to choke off the pace of the relatively nascent recovery of the labor market. Reflecting my outlook for prices and employment, my appropriate policy rate path involves deferring liftoff until late 2016.  But I will leave a full discussion of that until tomorrow, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", "  MR. KAMIN.  Then they went up and back down.  So they have, netting out over the intermeeting period, flattened out.  In that sense, the \u201cearlier\u201d could be correct, but it might be easier just to delete it. CHAIR YELLEN.  Cross it out", " MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to go back to exhibit 1 and the analysis of the SEP. As I understand the argument, if we just go by Taylor (1999), the Committee looks pretty dovish, according to the first figure.  And you might be able to rationalize that if you think r* is moving around. Now, one thing I would say about that is, Taylor (1999) was rationalized based on an application to past U.S. data, and the argument was that it fit the data pretty well and we got pretty good outcomes.  There are even models that might rationalize Taylor (1999) as an optimalmonetary policy rule.  If you say, \u201cOkay, now we\u2019re going to substitute in the time-varying r*,\u201d we lose that rationalization, and we\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s really a good monetary policy rule or not.  So I think it might warrant further research. If that\u2019s what you think is happening around the Committee and around monetary policy generally, it might warrant further research to ask, \u201cWould it have been a good idea historically to follow the variations in r* the way it\u2019s being described here in the bottom panel", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support alternative B.  It drops the word \u201cpatient\u201d and thus keeps June on the table, which I think is essential, because if the data come in reasonably close to our forecast, I think we should raise rates in June.  While I support the new forward-guidance language, it\u2019s important to be aware that it introduces some important internal tension into the statement.  The new language states that the Committee anticipates raising rates \u201cwhen it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d  This seems to leave open the possibility that we are not now reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our objective.  In contrast, the second paragraph states that we expect \u201cinflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.\u201d  In the broader context of that paragraph, I take this to mean that we are confident that our future policy actions will bring inflation back to 2 percent. So our new forward-guidance language appears to be in conflict with the second paragraph, because it seems to suggest we\u2019re not confident about our future conduct of monetary policy.  This is an awkward and potentially confusing implication to convey.  One way to reconcile the two passages is to change the forward-guidance language to read \u201cremains reasonably confident\u201d instead of \u201cis reasonably confident,\u201d implying that we are now confident.  Another approach would be to interpret the \u201creasonably confident\u201d language as conditional onraising rates\u2014in other words, to interpret the forward-guidance language as meaning to say that the Committee anticipates raising rates \u201cwhen it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that an increase in rates is consistent with inflation moving back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d  Now, rewording the forward guidance this way would eliminate the apparent conflict with the second paragraph.  The language there is about our confidence that our policy will get inflation back to 2 percent, while the language in paragraph 3 says that, to raise rates, we want to be reasonably confident that raising rates won\u2019t prevent us from getting back to 2 percent. I understand that, given the weeks and months of deliberations that have gone into crafting this language, this would be a late-in-the-game suggestion to make, so I\u2019m not going to insist on this change.  But I think that it\u2019s worth being aware of this tension as we talk about policy in public going forward.  In any event, this is something you might have to address in your press conference this afternoon, Madam Chair.  And it\u2019s something that, as I said, I think we should be continually aware of. Looking ahead at how the data might come in between now and June, I believe it\u2019s important to recognize that we could be reasonably confident about inflation then\u2014as you said, Madam Chair\u2014even if the monthly readings on core inflation continue to bounce around at a relatively low level. Certainly, we\u2019d rather not see persistently soft core inflation, but our focus should be on the outlook for inflation, not on realized values.  In particular, I don\u2019t think we should convey that a substantial rise in reported core inflation is in some way a precondition for lifting off in June.  Setting a high bar by waiting to see a vigorous rise in actual inflation ignores the long and variable lags that we know are associated with monetary policy, and it risks a return to the \u201cgo-stop\u201d regime that made monetary policy a driving force behind real fluctuations.   As I noted at the outset, if conditions evolve close to expectations over the next few months, then I\u2019m likely to argue for a rate increase in June.  If so, I will do so based on the premise that we should set our monetary policy instrument so as to align the real short-term interest rate with the economy\u2019s underlying real fundamentals. What do we know about those fundamentals.  Over the past three years, we\u2019ve seen the following:  Consumption has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent, a number we last saw in the fall of 2007; the unemployment rate has fallen almost 3 percentage points, from 8.3 percent to 5.5 percent; and employment has grown at a 1.9 percent annual rate, a number we last saw in the spring of 2001. Over the same time period, the short-term real interest rate has been below negative 1 percent. Our understanding of the relationship between the natural real rate, as it\u2019s called, and observable variables is admittedly imprecise.  But I think both theory and experience tell us that a real interest rate of negative 1 percent is unlikely to be consistent with continuing low inflation in the face of the steady growth we\u2019ve seen in the real economy. Granted, the natural real interest rate may have shifted down in recent years, but I\u2019d note that attempts to quantify that decline, such as those based on the work of Laubach and Williams, did not generate anything like the current level of real rates.  So I think a strong case can be made that our policy rate should be higher right now, and June represents the first opportunity to raise rates without contradicting our past forward guidance.

This refers to the expectations about the size of the ON RRP facility post-liftoff.

Is that accurate", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019d like to respectfully dissent again on the foreign swap arrangements.  The Richmond Reserve Bank has dissented on these swap lines going back 20 years on the grounds that they facilitate inappropriate actions by the Federal Reserve.  One is sterilized foreign exchange operations, which are inappropriate for reasons I spoke about in January.  The other is channeling intergovernmental assistance to our NAFA partners, among others, who may be well deserving of such assistance, but that constitutes fiscal policy that\u2019s best left to fiscal authorities, in our view.

In this initial period, would you envision all meetings, or a mix of briefings and meetings. CHAIR YELLEN. My understanding is the idea is that we are going to preschedule these times. When we start the video meeting, we will have some sense of whether things are going smoothly, and we really don\u2019t have decisions to make, in which case the staff could be relieved of the burden of doing transcripts and so forth.  I would call that a briefing.  But clearly, if things are not going very smoothly and we need to deliberate, we would convene that as a   meeting right from the outset.  And, I suppose, even in the middle, if something began as a briefing, and we decided in the middle of that briefing, \u201cLook, we need to discuss something.\u201d Is that fair to say", " MR. ALVAREZ.  A briefing is an interaction with the staff, and you can ask questions, and it is for the purpose of disseminating information.  If the Committee wanted to have a discussion in which they are deliberating about a decision, that would be a meeting itself", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a follow-up to Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s question.  For how many of the short-term credit markets is it important to know about the closing in Europe.  As we think about the timing of the meetings, are there a bunch of short-term instruments that would make it relevant to act in the morning, because of when Europe closes", " MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  This is just a logistical question, Madam Chair.  Do I understand correctly that what you anticipate doing is, if we agree with the concept of having these prearranged briefings, that all of our calendars will need to be kept open for two weeks following each of the next I-don\u2019t-know-how-many FOMC meetings", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

TARULLO.  There are already a number of international meetings that several of us on the Board, I think, are going to have\u2014and Vice Chairman Dudley will have conflicts with as well", " MR. KAMIN. Well, the simulations come from a DSGE model, but it\u2019s not an estimated model.  So we don\u2019t compute those, although I assure you that an estimated version of SIGMA that would allow us to compute those is on our long-term work agenda. The most tenuous thing is whether or not you will actually get a 10 percent additional rise in the dollar.  As you can tell from the chart, that\u2019s not a common occurrence.  That\u2019s something that, broadly speaking, we think there might be a 1 in 10 chance of for a couple of years.  So that, in some sense, is the most tenuous. In terms of thinking about the effects on net exports and then on U.S. real GDP, that\u2019s actually a little bit more straightforward in the sense that the results from SIGMA\u2014particularly for what I\u2019m showing here, which is the net export contribution\u2014are broadly consistent with our estimated trade models, and those don\u2019t give you very different results.  So the effect of a higher dollar on exports and on imports is relatively straightforward, and obviously there are errors, but they\u2019re probably not subject to huge errors. A larger area of uncertainty comes in when translating the effect of the change in net exports into GDP, because there is some uncertainty there about the multipliers.  And there\u2019salso some uncertainty about to what extent you want to build in a monetary policy response and what impact that has.  So, for the net export contribution itself, I would guess that, relatively speaking, is not a huge confidence error.  The confidence errors would rise as you then translate that through to real GDP growth", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to thank the staff for the excellent assessment of financial stability.  It\u2019s my reading that the assessment again indicates that current policy has not produced any material signs of financial instability.  Indeed, it appears that the main financial-instability consideration for monetary policy at the moment is that a near-term increase in the target range for the federal funds rate could lead to financial instability.  As the report says, \u201cTerm premiums in benchmark U.S. and other advanced economy bond yields are again near historical lows reached before the taper tantrum, raising the risk of similarly outsized market reactions at liftoff.\u201d   The staff also identified a vulnerability that could propagate this shock from the increase in rates.  Specifically, page 4 of the assessment notes that changes in the structure of the Treasury market could amplify the effects of an initial rate move and lead to sudden swings in prices and liquidity. Now, how can we best mitigate this risk.  President Rosengren, I think, highlighted one way to think about this, which is through communication, but I have a slightly different perspective on the answer to this question.  To answer this question, I think we have to understand why long-term rates might rise dramatically in response to a small increase in short-term rates. And here I believe that a key consideration is the policy signal associated with such a move in the near term.  Raising the federal funds rate in the near term would mean they\u2019re initiating liftoff when inflation is far below target and the growth outlook has been weakening.  Liftoff in such an environment would indicate that the FOMC is considerably less willing to provide accommodation to respond to adverse shocks than financial market participants currently anticipate. As a result, they would expect less accommodation in general but especially so in bad times, and this expectation of higher interest rates and lower bond prices in bad times translates directly into higher term premiums. Now, it\u2019s tempting to conclude that we can somehow mitigate this potential financial instability only through reassuring verbal communication at the time of liftoff, but I think it\u2019s difficult for words to trump the communication content of our actions.  So, in my view, we can best mitigate this financial stability risk by ensuring that our actions are always clearly connected to our pursued, declared objectives. In the current context, that would mean deferring liftoff until the economic data clearly indicate that raising interest rates is necessary for the FOMC to achieve its declared objectives of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment over the  medium term. I\u2019ll say more about what this conclusion means for our policy deliberations tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams", " MR. ROSENGREN.  If you think you can significantly change the probability or amplitude of those shocks, then you are right.  But the equilibrium federal funds rate has come down quite a bit.  Our own internal estimates of what that implies for how frequently we will hit the zero lower bound are that it is substantially higher given that most of the time the equilibrium federal funds rate that many of those models were estimated on was 4\u00bd percent.  We are now at 3\u00bd percent\u2014I actually think you could make an argument that it is lower than 3\u00bd percent.  So if you have an equilibrium federal funds rate that is lower, the implication is that you hit the zero lower bound more frequently unless you think you can dramatically alter either the frequency or severity of having the kind of shocks that we experienced. CHAIR YELLEN.  Isn\u2019t it the case that some of the steps we would take to reduce the odds of a financial crisis\u2014strengthening capital and liquidity\u2014may actually, by raising the cost of intermediation, lower the equilibrium real rate", " MR. ROSENGREN.  In that case", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  I would say that hitting an inflation target temporarily because of an oil price shock is a Pyrrhic victory.  You care more about the underlying rate of inflation", " MR. LOCKHART. Moving right along.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting cycle, my staff conducted 56 interviews separate from our board meetings. We focused the interviews on any indications in their businesses that would confirm the weakness indicated by first-quarter data and, more to the point, suggest that first-quarter weakness might persist. We found that overall business sentiment remains quite positive, somewhat at odds with our reading of the incoming data.  On balance, our contacts and directors portrayed demand as continuing to improve at a steady pace.  We noted, however, that compared with the previous cycle, their optimism is accompanied by a hint of caution.  We heard more reports of negative effects of the dollar.  Exporters, port operators, and firms with significant foreign operations all noted market or other challenges that they attributed to the dollar. As expected, we heard reports of investment pullback and layoffs in oil and gas exploration and production firms as well as in oil services companies.  That drag is being partially offset by greater investment activity in business sectors benefiting from low energy prices. We also continued to hear reports that firms are trying to hold on to margin improvement coming from fuel and other commodity cost declines. Declines in gasoline prices have yet to translate into a meaningful boost in consumer spending.  A director with knowledge of consumer markets commented that product categories that historically have been leading indicators of stronger consumer activity\u2014to wit, apparel, eating outside the home, and movies\u2014have not yet signaled an upturn. We received positive reports on real estate investment activity, both commercial and residential. Architects and contractors indicated improved pipelines.  Our banking contacts report that new mortgage and investment activity is strong. Regarding employment, we heard continued concern about turnover and retention.  At the same time, we detected little change in reports this round regarding wage inflation.  On that subject, although most data indicate that the trend in nominal wage growth remains flat, a measure constructed by my staff from the Current Population Survey does show an acceleration in year-over-year wage growth in the first quarter.  Wage growth increased to a 3 percent pace in the first quarter, up from 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter and up from 2.4 percent a year earlier. Continuing on employment, I\u2019ll mention something we heard for the first time from three large employers in quite different businesses.  All said they have begun shifting their work forces away from part time toward full time.  They all cited the high managerial and logistical cost and quality challenges of a large, part-time workforce. We\u2019ve been struggling to reconcile these generally positive anecdotal reports with the hard data on the first quarter and early indications of second-quarter performance.  Our tracking estimate of first-quarter GDP growth is just marginally above zero, at the low end of the spectrum presented in the Tealbook. Our tracking model is a straight statistical model with no judgmental overrides.  We would not claim it\u2019s the most accurate read of the first quarter, but it\u2019s what the raw data are telling us, and we\u2019ll have an official reading soon enough\u2014tomorrow morning.  At this point, I\u2019m holding to the view that weather and other factors played a significant role in first-quarter weakness, and that significant payback can be anticipated in the current quarter. We also observed\u2014and this is nothing more than an observation\u2014that weak first-quarter growth has been a pattern during the recovery, normally giving way to a stronger rest of the year. We\u2019ve made a small adjustment to our full-year GDP growth forecast to reflect a weaker first quarter, but otherwise we have kept our forecast for growth and inflation unchanged from the March meeting.  We made no material change to our outlook.  We have growth resuming a run rate between 2\u00bd and 3 percent, with second-quarter growth above 3 percent. A strengthening of consumer activity from the first quarter is a key factor in our outlook.   We currently judge the risk to our growth and inflation outlooks as tilted to the downside.  With the greater uncertainty I perceive at this juncture, the Tealbook alternative scenario titled \u201cPersistent Slowdown in Economic Activity\u201d captures my concern that my outlook may be overly optimistic.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams", " WILLIAMS.  The horse race was basically this:  We aligned the inflation swap rate one year ahead with the swaps of months 13 to 24 ahead\u2014one year ahead with one year ahead.  And then we looked at the Survey of Professional Forecasters and Blue Chip for each year", " MR. EVANS.  Oh, yes, but those forecasts are lousy.  They might be better than the other ones, but they\u2019re all lousy", " MR. TARULLO.  Madam Chair, if I could\u2014President Bullard, I was a little bit confused by what you were saying about labor force participation, and particularly the staff\u2019s assessment of it.  My understanding of what the staff has been saying is that while they project a downward trend in labor force participation because of demographics, they also assess the decline in the immediate post-crisis years to have been substantially steeper than that.  And what they were predicting\u2014and continue, I think, to predict, unless Bill corrects me\u2014is a less steep decline or a flattening-out of current labor force participation, which eventually has their projected demographic trend\u2013based participation rate converging with the actual participation rate.  And that, I think, is what\u2019s been happening over the past year and a half or so, during which, with a little bit of fluctuation up and down, the labor force participation rate has been roughly stable, which I think is bearing out the staff\u2019s expectation of the convergence of their projected trend with actual labor force participation", " MR. LAUBACH. I have two thoughts, perhaps, on that, and maybe Simon can also weigh in on at least one of them.  Namely, as Simon showed you yesterday, there was a question in the primary dealer survey on which factors market participants view as most relevant for the achievement of reasonable confidence.  So there is an indirect route in the sense that what you say in the statement will be evaluated even though you may not have a direct statement in there about how the Committee is now more or less confident than before.  Presumably, market participants will look at your characterization of these various factors and draw conclusions from that about how your confidence has shifted. I\u2019m not quite sure how easy it would be to try to come up with a summary statement for the degree of confidence because, well, my guess is that various participants rank different criteria differently, and I think that\u2019s evident from your comments.  Therefore, I believe this is a step that\u2019s left to market participants and the public in general to draw conclusions about this", " MR. LAUBACH.  There are two separate aspects to this.  One is, what if monetary policy transmission also importantly works through term premiums.  That means that term premiums systematically vary with the path of short-term interest rates. To some extent, that is actually the case in the FRB/US model\u2014namely, that the term premium is an endogenous function of expected future output gaps.  So to the extent that choices about the path of the funds rate affect the outlook for future output gaps, that has an added effect by moving term premiums endogenously as well. A separate question is, should a Taylor rule also take into account other financial conditions more broadly.  And there, arguably, a Taylor rule that responds only to current economic conditions may have a shortcoming because it responds only to current inflation and, say, the current output gap, whereas financial conditions that you observe today, like movements in the dollar and things like that, clearly affect your outlook in the future.  So that is not an aspect that is captured by Taylor rules that just mechanically respond to current conditions.  Of course, for example, if you look at optimal control, it obviously knows about these things because it\u2019s run under perfect foresight.  Therefore, agents anticipate that changes in financial conditions today more broadly, including changes in term premiums, will affect the future outlook", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  The data to date have not met the conditions we provided in the March statement for raising rates.  I am very skeptical that these conditions can be met by June.  With two quarters of weak real GDP growth,we once again are faced with a forecast of improvement\u2014the data reflect broader-based weakness. In addition, international conditions since the March meeting have become more worrisome.  The frustration among Greek leaders when talking with European policymakers is palpable, while the European policymakers I spoke with seemed to have more confidence that any problems associated with a Greek default could be readily contained. I am less confident that a smooth resolution will be achieved.  Moreover, I worry that this misplaced confidence in the likely containment of spillovers arising from a possible Greek default may generate conditions that make default even more likely. As I discussed yesterday, it is possible our inflation target is too low, given the accumulating evidence that we set the target based on research that underestimated both the likelihood and severity of being at the zero lower bound.  If we are willing to entertain a higher target, then a later liftoff would be further justified.  In part, this would also indicate a higher standard for moving, shifting from reasonable confidence that we are moving toward our inflation target to just plain confidence that we are moving toward our inflation target. As the data to date should not make us even reasonably confident, this distinction will become more relevant at future meetings, presumably in the fall. In terms of language, I would take out the \u201cat least,\u201d and I would keep \u201cin part reflecting transitory factors.\u201d  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Holcomb", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, although with a language change, which I will get to toward the end of my remarks. I first wanted to say that I agree with people that once we have removed the forward guidance, as we\u2019ve now done, every meeting should be a live meeting in which the possibility of a change in the federal funds rate can be on the table.  Having said that, though, we still have different assessments as to how likely it is that we think we\u2019re going to want to raise the federal funds rate target range in the next couple of meetings.  I, for one, don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely at all.  But I do believe that we should not do anything that formally takes it off the table. I wasn\u2019t going to comment on this, but President Lockhart\u2019s thoughtful observations did provoke me to say a couple of things on how to begin moving forward.  I think I\u2019m coming out in a somewhat different place, although only in a tentative way, and would like to hear other people\u2019s views on this.  I\u2019d be reluctant to put back into paragraph 3 at some point an indication that, one or two meetings from now, we are more likely to move.  The reason is, I think that becomes a form of calendar guidance of its own.  Just as, when we put in the quasi-calendar guidance before, saying, \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t really calendar\u2014it\u2019s all data dependent,\u201d the markets all read it as calendar guidance, I think the same thing is going to happen now if we put in language such as that included in paragraph 3 of alternative C. My preference would be that we use paragraph 2 as the vehicle for beginning to communicate a change in the Committee\u2019s collective view as to where the economy is headed, which, it\u2019s hoped, actually begins to, I would say, increase some volatility a little bit as people  begin to think liftoff is more likely but is not a done deal.  That way, we don\u2019t have a surprise at the meeting in which we eventually lift the target range, but it is not de facto occurring just by the inclusion of language in paragraph 3 at a meeting before we\u2019ve actually decided to lift the target range. As I said, my current view is that June is very unlikely as an appropriate time to increase the target range.  I thought that paragraph 1 as originally circulated a week or two ago actually hit about right the factual characterization of the economy.  It\u2019s fairly hard to argue with the proposition that the data were rather disappointing and pretty bad, yet paragraph 1 began with something saying that it was \u201cin part reflecting transitory factors.\u201d  Most important, I think, the beginning of paragraph 2 communicates that \u201cAlthough growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect\u2026\u201d  In other words, the basic direction of the Committee\u2019s expectations hasn\u2019t changed, notwithstanding the disappointing developments reported in paragraph 1. Notwithstanding the fact that I thought the original paragraph 1 got it about right, I\u2019m okay with most of the changes that have been made since the original language was circulated, although I wouldn\u2019t want to see us going too much further to try to look for the cheery in a way that would obscure what\u2019s actually happened.  The one exception, Madam Chair, is the sentence on inflation, which is the second-to-last sentence in paragraph 1.  Back in March, that sentence said \u201cInflation has declined further below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices.\u201d  So the phrase \u201clargely reflecting declines in energy prices\u201d was, in effect, explaining how the decline had gone further below.  It was an explanation of the delta.  I think the language that was circulated originally to the Committee a week or two ago is now in alternative A, and the language is as follows: \u201cInflation continued to run well below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, largely reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.\u201d  There, the way I read it when that language was circulated was that now this phrase \u201clargely reflecting\u201d in effect explains the \u201cwell\u201d part\u2014why it is \u201cwell\u201d below.  But as it\u2019s been modified, the sentence now reads \u201cInflation continued to run below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, largely reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case that all of the difference between the Committee\u2019s target and where we are right now is explained based on the earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.  On the contrary, as many people pointed out yesterday and a little bit today already, we haven\u2019t been hitting the inflation target for quite some time now.  And if you pull out housing inflation\u2014which, of course, is largely a function of rents imputed to homeowners\u2014then you have an awful lot of continuing questions about how much inflation there is. As a factual matter, I think we should modify that sentence to say something like the following: \u201cInflation continued to run below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports\u201d\u2014or something just making clear that that second phrase does not account for all of the difference between the Committee\u2019s target and where we are right now. Finally, like those who have gone before me, I would prefer removing \u201cat least\u201d in the first sentence.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.

I think leaving it as is, rather than going with the suggestion, is, frankly, my own preference. Finally, we have Governor Tarullo\u2019s suggested change.  That would be in the \u201cinflation\u201d sentence, the next-to-last sentence in paragraph 1, and the suggestion is to change \u201clargely reflecting\u201d to \u201cpartly reflecting.\u201d I did hear quite a bit of support for that.  Personally, I\u2019m also  open to making that change, but let me see what people think who didn\u2019t weigh in on that.

And there was a time\u2014I think it was in the \u201990s, the memo said\u2014when a dealer failed, and we said, \u201cWell, no, it\u2019s not our responsibility to check on their safety and soundness.\u201d  But what you\u2019re telling me is, we really do care", " MR.

But any way we can make clear that we\u2019re not there in a supervisory role or a safety-and-soundness role would be great. Again, if you look at the history that we produced, this has been a constant tension, because the mere fact that we\u2019re the counterparty and we have to do some due diligence because these are counterparties in a business relationship, but at the same time we\u2019re a central bank with supervisory policies\u2014it\u2019s very hard to separate that, both in the mind of the public and in the mind of the firms that we deal with", " MR.

We\u2019ve had these very bad draws on productivity growth, and you\u2019ve talked about how you expect it to return to its trend rate.  What\u2019s the staff\u2019s underlying story about what we\u2019re seeing. Is it mismeasured GDP.  Is it less capital deepening.  Is it that we just don\u2019t understand it.  Are there competing theories about why we\u2019re seeing such lousy productivity numbers.  And how does that influence how we should think about the outlook.  Which weight do you put on that", " MR. KAMIN.  It might be also worth noting\u2014returning to panel 2, looking at the cyclical version\u2014that the calculation for AFEs actually bounces back a lot right after the global financial crisis reaches its height in 2008 and 2009.  It then goes back down again, probably largely reflecting the euro crisis and its effects on our AFE aggregate combined, a little bit later, with the effect of the consumption tax increase on Japan.  So both the euro area and Japan have experienced these secondary reverberations that do, to some extent, reflect the initial crisis but could be thought of as additional shocks that maybe the U.S. economy was not subject to", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My forecast does not have a \u201cGolden State\u201d adjustment factor, so it\u2019s not quite as optimistic as President Williams\u2019s.  My SEP submission does not differ significantly from the Tealbook forecast and has not changed much from the March meeting, although I assume in this submission that the first tightening will be in the fourth quarter, not in September.  The biggest change from my previous submission is the marking down of 2015 real GDP growth to reflect the weak data we received for the first half of this year.  The data bearing on second-quarter real GDP growth have been surprisingly weak after allowing for the fact that the bounceback from the array of first-quarter special factors is likely artificially elevating reported growth for the current quarter.  If the Tealbook adjustment to transitory factors is accurate, second-quarter growth adjusted for these factors may fall short of potential growth.  Put differently, the weather and other transitory factors only partly explain the weakness in the first half of the year, since data both before and after the winter storms have remained relatively weak. Although the May retail sales numbers and revisions to earlier months provide some comfort that consumption will not be particularly weak this quarter, it remains slower than I would expect on the basis of its strong fundamental drivers.  The apparent desire of consumers to save rather than spend the windfall generated by lower oil prices puts at risk the consumer-led recovery that I and many others foresaw at the time of the March SEP submission.  The May payroll employment report provides further evidence of healing labor markets.  However, I am cautious about the labor market outlook for several reasons.  The unemployment rate has, at least for the moment, leveled off at 5\u00bd percent\u2014basically unchanged since February. Under my projection of only moderate growth in the second half of this year, we will likely return only gradually to my 5 percent estimate of the full-employment unemployment rate. It is notable that the labor market conditions index shown in the Tealbook indicates only modest growth in the first quarter and is negative for the average of the first two months of this quarter.  Although I would not take too literally the magnitude of the change in labor market conditions implied by the LMCI, I would interpret the index as indicating some slowdown in labor market conditions relative to last year.  And, of course, the labor market conditions would likely slow further if we do not see the expected pickup in growth in the second half of this year. Progress on returning inflation to its 2 percent target over the forecast horizon remains disappointing.  Core PCE inflation over the past year is currently at 1.2 percent, well below what many of us were forecasting at the beginning of this year.  Sifting through the various indicators of price pressures provides little evidence that prices have yet begun trending toward 2 percent. It is still possible that transitory factors, such as exchange rate and energy pass-through, are playing a noticeable role, and that once these factors fade, progress toward our inflation goal will occur.  However, I place some weight on the possibility that the current low inflation readings reflect an anchoring of inflation expectations below our 2 percent target. Another possibility is that the equilibrium unemployment rate is running below my estimate of 5 percent. In light of the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, policy guidance should not just rely, as it does now, on being \u201creasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d  Policy should place more weight on data rather than  forecasts that indicate such a return is in train. In a sense, that is why we have moved to data dependence in our policy decisions.  To be specific, becoming reasonably confident that we will trend toward 2 percent inflation requires evidence that core PCE inflation is closer to the 1\u00bd percent growth that we had been expecting earlier this year, that real growth is growing faster than we have seen so far in the first half of this year, and that the growth is sufficiently high to produce a further tightening in labor markets. There have been significant benefits to being as patient as we have been to date.  Broader measures of unemployment have continued to improve, though they still remain elevated.  Tighter labor markets are beginning to provide modest evidence of a gradual increase in nominal wages and compensation.  And we have not tightened financial conditions at a time when Europe is going through a particularly difficult time.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart", " MR. LACKER.  No, of course it wouldn\u2019t, but the point is that your estimate is basically saying the real rate has been low lately, which we all know", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Well, I just have a question on the tradeoff between data dependence and forward guidance.  When I look at the probability that you have in your top-right panel in exhibit 1, we have a roughly 45 percent probability of moving in September, and presumably, if the data comes in as forecast, that probability would improve on its own as we get into July. I guess the goal would be to get that much closer to 80 or 90 percent, since we wouldn\u2019t be comfortable that 45 or 55 was quite enough.  And I just want to think about what the relative benefit of getting that additional increase would be as we get into September, particularly if the data surprises us in August and we end up having to backtrack.  So we\u2019ve moved into an environment in which we\u2019ve tried to avoid forward guidance, and we\u2019ve really highlighted data dependence in speeches and in what we\u2019ve put into the statement. Can you give me the relative cost and benefit of adding in language that moves away from data dependence\u2014to tip our hat a little bit more\u2014and how much additional benefit we would get from tipping our hat versus what happens if we tip our hat and turn out to be wrong", " MR. FISCHER.  Thomas, what\u2019s in these data", "  Is this every individual giving a probability of what is\u2014 MR. LAUBACH.  Which chart are you looking at.

All right. So if we can take the average probability distribution at the timing of liftoff, the top-right one, let\u2019s suppose we go along the path we expect to be on and the data are reasonable, if not absolutely decisive.  We\u2019ll have a decision to make in September, but it won\u2019t be totally clear to market participants what we will do.  So the probability weight will pile up a little bit on September from the left, and the question is, what happens on the right in the market.  And if some of them move off to the right\u2014saying, for instance, the Committee is showing some reluctance to pull the trigger or something\u2014then when we do pull the trigger, we\u2019re going to have a lot of noise in the market, I assume.  And if it all piles up on September 16 and 17, because everybody thinks it\u2019s obvious that\u2019s what we are going to do, then we\u2019ll have less noise in the market at the time of the decision.

The existing sentence says, \u201cIn particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to \u00bc percent.\u201d I thought that was kind of right, and I thought that would be very right when we raise the range from 25 to 50 basis points.  I thought it was exactly the right sentence, and you\u2019re suggesting striking that out and fixing the next sentence, which is actually the problem:  \u201cThe Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary.\u201d I thought we weren\u2019t doing open market operations and we had no plan to do open market operations for the next couple of years in order to hit the range.

PRICHARD.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.  Just a question on C\u2032 itself. It\u2019s on page 12.  The draft C\u2032 statement deletes paragraph 5.  I understand why you want to delete it with the introductory clause, but why wouldn\u2019t the essence of paragraph 5 want to be sustained so that it doesn\u2019t appear that we\u2019re retreating from the two principles that are embodied in paragraph 5", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  To start, I support the plans for separate communication regarding our policy implementation tools after liftoff.  And I am okay with the housekeeping changes, but I can go either way, just as you suggested. For today\u2019s decision, I support alternative B as written.  I would note, though, that the recent softer economic data and lack of improvement in core PCE have led me to push back my preferred appropriate monetary policy liftoff date to midyear 2016.  My staff\u2019s DSGE analysis that I talked about yesterday also pushed me in that direction. As you recall, that analysis showed how changes in the Survey of Professional Forecasters\u2019 10-year CPI inflation outlook and other incoming data are holding back the model\u2019s longer-run inflation outlook. I appreciated the extremely useful and timely Tealbook analysis of the potential downward influences on the long-run equilibrium real interest rate and the policy implications of a lower value for r*. I think most of us are accustomed to simply having a single r* assessment in mind and not really considering the uncertainty surrounding r*, at least as we formulate the models and analytical analyses. A fundamental underpinning for the Committee\u2019s choice of a 2 percent inflation objective back in January 2012 was strong confidence that the long-run equilibrium real rate was 2 percent or higher.  Indeed, in our January 2012 SEP submissions, 16 out of 17 of the long-run federal funds rate dots were consistent with r* being between 2 and 2\u00bd percent. Today the Tealbook assumes r* is 1\u00bd percent, in line with its lower assessment for productivity growth and potential output growth.  And the Committee\u2019s June SEP submissions  show broad agreement on this point, as all but three of the long-run nominal funds rate dots are consistent with an equilibrium real rate between 1\u00bc and 1\u00be percent. Furthermore, there is substantial uncertainty over this assessment.  Larry Summers and Ben Bernanke have debated whether a lower equilibrium rate reflects secular stagnation or a persistent global savings glut, but quantifying the magnitudes of these factors remains an important research objective.  Personally, I think that ascribing a zero effect to these phenomena seems unlikely.  More directly, lower potential output growth also suggests a lower r*. Again, the magnitude is uncertain and depends on the longer-run path for capital deepening, the effects of demographic trends, and whether TFP growth has persistently reverted to the slow-growth era of 1975 through 1995. Yesterday President Lacker made an interesting comment when he pointed out that the interest rate policy rules that we consider have intercepts and error terms that are isomorphic.  You can\u2019t just, by themselves, pick out the contribution because they enter in a linear fashion.  Okay.  But there is more identifying information that can come from these other analyses, like this list of factors that I just mentioned, and I think that it is important to assess that additional information as opposed to just ignoring it. We should take into account the fact that the posterior distribution of long-run r* is widely dispersed and that most of the weight in this distribution is on lower values than we were thinking back in January 2012.  Perhaps the posterior mode for r* is at the Tealbook assessment of 1\u00bd percent.  But for me, 1 percent or below also garners significant weight, and I put far less weight on r* being as high as 2 percent and negligible weights on higher values above 2 percent. This uncertainty has profound implications for monetary policy.  If the long-run equilibrium real rate is substantially lower than 2 percent, then the historically low nominal  funds rate paths that most of us have written down in our SEP submissions are not nearly as accommodative as we might have previously thought.  And, Madam Chair, you alluded to the same phenomenon when you talked about if productivity growth ends up being slower, that means r* will be lower, and, in fact, each and every point of our funds rate settings will be more restrictive. Of course, if economic fundamentals improve strongly, and inflation begins to rise more quickly, I would see that as evidence that the lowest r* values are diminishing in likelihood.  And, you know, this is another refutable implication of the viewpoint I think President Lacker associated with, which is that high r* is quite possible.  In that case, our funds rate would be more accommodative and we ought to see inflation rising much more rapidly to our inflation objective.  That ends up being a testable implication, and we can look for that. But I suspect that won\u2019t be the case.  Most likely, the economy will continue to face many challenging headwinds.  I will look to the data in order to decide these issues, but I want to be clear that the data have already provided a lot of evidence suggesting troubling and highly persistent phenomena that should weigh importantly in our strategies concerning liftoff and the subsequent normalization of policy rates. And just to be completely clear, I think that a full-throated endorsement of our symmetric inflation objective strategy could be a very helpful counterbalance to current and future headwinds. I agree completely with the comments that President Kocherlakota made yesterday regarding risks to our inflation objective and how we should address them. After all, even a 2 percent inflation target gives us uncomfortably little margin to engineer low enough real rates.  We don\u2019t want to make things worse by creating a de facto target below 2 percent.  Thank you, Madam Chair.CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Holcomb", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support option B for today.  As I said yesterday and I\u2019ve said in the past, with regard to our goal variables, we\u2019re about as close as we\u2019ve ever been in the postwar era.  So I think it\u2019s time that we look for opportunities to move our target policy rate off emergency settings.  We have a zero policy rate, and we have a very large balance sheet.  Those are the same settings that we had when we were much further from our goal variables. Certainly, the data that come in over the summer are going to be mixed, and I think we have to have the idea that we\u2019ll be opportunistic in our first policy move.  Also, once we make the policy move, obviously we\u2019re still going to be very accommodative. We\u2019re trying to hedge our bets in the direction of the economy getting more toward normal, so we\u2019re trying to move policy more toward normal, but we\u2019re still going to be very accommodative. We would like to take opportunities to make these policy moves, and I would very much like to make the first move on the back of good news about the economy.  Prescheduling September is going to work against this principle.  I mean, maybe the data will come in great right before that meeting and that will be perfect, but life often doesn\u2019t work out perfectly.  Anything we can do to try to get to a more flexible approach in which every meeting is, ex ante,   identical I think would be very helpful.  I don\u2019t think the Committee is really ready to think in terms of moving opportunistically, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to have to move over the normalization process.  The more we can, in our own minds, get toward that kind of an attitude, and then maybe get to a method that would actually implement that, I think would be helpful. I have two comments on the SEP.  One is about SEP paths being given according to an optimal policy assumption, and the second is about the horizon.  First, I think when we talk about the SEP, we need to clarify to people that the projections are put forward under an optimal policy assumption.  We might all be using different models.  Within those different models, policy might be somewhat different, and so the various forecasts are not all made on the same basis. They are not unconditional forecasts the way private-sector forecasts are, where the private-sector forecaster is also trying to forecast what this Committee will do and will give you an out-and-out forecast that you would then evaluate against mean-squared criterion or something like that. Here we\u2019re saying, given the models we have, we\u2019re putting something in under an optimal policy within that model.  So I\u2019d appreciate it if we\u2019d mention this when we talk about the SEP because I don\u2019t think that they are the same thing as the unconditional forecasts given in the private sector. For me, missing a rate rise means worse outcomes for the economy, according to the model that I\u2019m using.  So if you miss the time when the model said you should have lifted off, then you\u2019re going to get worse outcomes going forward than you otherwise could have achieved if you had raised rates earlier.  But given that you didn\u2019t move, there\u2019s some optimal policy going on from that point.  Over the normalization phase, I think this effect will cause federal funds rate dot paths to shift because we\u2019re not all exactly on the same timing schedule.  So you\u2019ve got these dot paths shifting around.  That may not be indicating a change in the sentiment   of the Committee as to where we are or what we need to do but is a detail of how the SEP is put together.  So I try to emphasize this.  I know that it doesn\u2019t go very far when I talk to people outside this Committee.  I know that we all understand it here, but the SEP is a different object from the private-sector forecasts that are often cited. The second comment on the SEP is that the horizon shifts through the year.  That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve always done, but I think it is kind of odd, and it warps the interpretation of the SEP compared with what it otherwise could be. What people really want to know is, what\u2019s your year-ahead outlook and your two-year-ahead outlook.  We should always be giving them a year-ahead outlook and a two-year-ahead outlook in a format that they can digest and see what we\u2019re saying. What\u2019s happening is, you get a bad first quarter.  Well, everyone has to mark down their forecast for the year if that was unexpected, and then we all think that the future looks worse than we previously said, but that isn\u2019t really what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re saying that that was an unexpected shock, and that the next four quarters and the four quarters beyond that might look roughly the same as they did before, and so that we have not perhaps changed our views that much on how the economy is going to evolve going forward.  So if we could get to something like that in the SEP, it might be an improvement.  I understand that that\u2019s a little bit different from how, let\u2019s say, the IMF would do it, or how other people would do it, but on the other hand, we\u2019re trying to convey what our outlook is, given the data we have today, then going forward from here\u2014four-quarter, eight-quarter horizons. On the other questions about C\u2032 and about the housekeeping changes, I was fine with what the staff proposed.  I don\u2019t have any further comments on that.  I would be happy to do the housekeeping changes at this meeting if people feel like that would get that out of the way, so we didn\u2019t have to do that at the time of the actual rate rise.

I support alternative C as being consistent with the data-dependent policy and with the statement in the previous FOMC minutes that the Committee\u2019s decision to begin normalizing policy would appropriately be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis. In terms of the criteria for liftoff, the March meeting minutes noted that further improvement in the labor market, stabilization of energy prices, and a leveling out of the foreign exchange value of the dollar would all be seen as helpful in establishing confidence that inflation would turn up.  Since March, we\u2019ve seen progress around each of those criteria.  Employment growth has averaged 207,000 over the past three months, and broader indicators of labor market activity have registered similar improvement.  Readings on core PCE inflation have remained largely stable on a year-over-year basis since December.  And, since the April meeting, we\u2019ve seen oil prices drift higher while the dollar has been relatively stable, which together give me confidence that transitory effects will dissipate.  In addition, our policy rules continue to point to higher rates, and the byproduct of our highly accommodative policy can be found in the incentives of searching for higher yield and the willingness to take on additional risk when interest rate expectations are flat. With the combination of these factors, and understanding that monetary policy operates with long lags, I believe that it is time to begin the process for normalizing policy. In light of yesterday\u2019s discussion about the implication of alternative values of the long-run federal funds rate, I would note, as I did at the previous meeting, that measures of r* often do not move independently of measures of the output gap.  I understand the correlation may not be perfect, but I think an important scenario to consider, as others have noted, is what a lower r*, driven by lower potential output, implies for monetary policy. Productivity growth has been running far below earlier trends.  This suggests a low r* is likely to be reflective of slowing growth of potential GDP rather than persistent weak demand.  If that\u2019s true, the implications for the output gap and liftoff do not necessarily suggest a later liftoff, so I look forward to further discussion and analysis of this aspect of our policy decisionmaking. In terms of today\u2019s decision, market expectations for liftoff are clearly focused on September, with a skew toward December and even into 2016.  This suggests to me that one soft data point\u2014a soft employment report, similar to what we had in March\u2014could easily push expectations back to December.  Yet for all the hand-wringing about the slowdown in Q1, the employment numbers remained solid and growth seems to be on a relatively firm footing.  Yet the strong employment report in May did little to move expectations forward.  This asymmetry is going to be hard to overcome, and it risks pushing back the date of liftoff as we wait to see a consistent streak of strong data. In terms of the two items that we\u2019ve highlighted, I am fine with a separate implementation note. I think that will serve us well in keeping that separate from the statement. And in terms of the housekeeping changes for the directive, I would be comfortable doing those today with the minutes, noting what their relevance is in terms of future decisions.  Thank you.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to object a little bit to Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s characterization of the Committee as not being able to move at various meetings.  This Committee has moved and can move at any meeting and should feel free to do so, and to tie us up in knots about one meeting out of the year as our one chance to move, I think, is a ridiculous characterization of U.S. monetary policy.  We can move.  We have moved in the past, and if the data call for it, then we should do it.  I understand what he\u2019s saying about considerations about this, but it\u2019s too much.

On 2013, I think I belittled their views a little bit about whether they\u2019d actually be there when the FOMC made its statement. I think they will be.  The slightly different variation\u2014Vice Chairman Dudley talked about this at the June meeting\u2014is that they\u2019re aware there\u2019s a lot of movement in money markets as you come up to quarter-end, and there\u2019s a belief that those could be more intense around year-end.  So there are some market participants who believe that the FOMC would be wary of lifting off around year-end because of the ability toshow interest rate control. It\u2019s not a view that I share in terms of the tools that we have, but definitely some of the people we speak to have that perception", " MR. POTTER.  But I think that most of what we hear is just that market liquidity in general is not as robust at the end of the year.  So if there\u2019s some noise around liftoff, then that could be exaggerated by that lack of liquidity", " MR. POTTER.  There\u2019s definitely\u2014from some market technical reasons\u2014some seasonals in TIPS trading that could account for that.  We didn\u2019t have a good explanation for the high correlation you can see in that chart earlier.  We looked for some explanations.  Some of those explanations should still be in play, so that would make us perhaps doubt those explanations that we came up with before, because we were clutching at straws a lot", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes, the debt limit is a wild card", " MS. REMACHE. Thank you, Beth.  In thinking about the strategy to end reinvestments, there are some market-specific issues which the Committee may wish to consider.  In the Treasury market, the Federal Reserve\u2019s redemption of maturing securities will require the Treasury to auction more securities to the public than if the SOMA continues to roll over its Treasury holdings.  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 2, maturing securities from the SOMA\u2014shown in blue\u2014would add, on average, 40 percent to the projected increase in public holdings from 2016 through 2020 relative to the increase arising from the budget deficit\u2014shown in red.  While these total increases are large, they are less than those recorded during the recession that followed the financial crisis.  That said, 2008 to 2009 was a period in which demand for Treasury securities was elevated, and it remains to be seen how the market would adjust without this boost to demand. While the market response to ending reinvestments will depend on the level and dispersion of market expectations for the path of the portfolio\u2014which I will discuss in just a moment\u2014in the case of Treasury securities, the effect will also be determined by the Treasury\u2019s decisions about the maturity profile of the additional securities it issues. The Treasury might initially respond to the onset of SOMA redemptions by issuing more bills.  Over time, however, the Treasury would likely shift this financing toward longer-maturity coupon securities. In the MBS market, participants have expressed more concern about potential market strains. During the period where the Federal Reserve continues to reinvest the principal it receives from its MBS holdings, it will be purchasing approximately 30 percent of gross TBA-eligible issuance, a proportionately larger amount than in the Treasury market.  In addition, the inherent difficulties in accurately predicting prepayment activity implies considerable uncertainty about the dollar amount of reinvestments, limiting the extent to which markets can fully anticipate the effect of a decision to cease reinvestments. The bottom panel of your exhibit shows net changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s MBS activity over time.  Focusing on the black line, it highlights that in March 2010, following the completion of the first round of asset purchases, the shift in Federal Reserve participation in the mortgage market was larger than what is projected based on the current forecast, shown by the dotted portion of the line in early 2016.  Overall, the market withstood that change without significant disruption.  That said, the underlying structure of the market has shifted since then, with greater concentration among dealers and more constrained balance sheets due to the changing regulatory environment. These concerns may support a decision to phase out reinvestments over time rather than ceasing them all at once.  On the one hand, while a well-telegraphed end to reinvestments is not likely to lead to significant disruptions, phasing out reinvestments may provide insurance against this possibility and, if executed over a few quarters, would likely not have significantly different macroeconomic effects compared with a case in which cessation occurred all at once.  On the other hand, it would lead to a slower decline in the portfolio, though the change would only extend the timing of the normalization of the size of the portfolio by a few months.The Committee may also wish to consider phasing out reinvestments in order to address the uneven pattern of redemptions.  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, the amount of maturing Treasury securities held by the SOMA\u2014shown by the red bars\u2014will vary between $2 billion and $39 billion per month in 2016.  Although the projection of MBS principal payments\u2014shown by the blue bars\u2014appears smooth and steady, actual prepayments will vary over time as a function of prepayment behavior.  Smoothing redemptions may, on the margin, help the market absorb the new supply without a noticeable effect on the overall trajectory of the balance sheet or the associated withdrawal of accommodation.  An incidental benefit of phasing out Treasury reinvestments over time would be to add Treasury benchmark securities to the SOMA portfolio during the reinvestment period, which could then be made available to lend.  The SOMA has not held benchmark securities for some time because of the sales under the System\u2019s maturity extension program, but making securities available to lend from the SOMA is helpful when there is tightness in the specials repo market. If the Committee wished to phase reinvestments out over time, it could do so in a number of ways.  A straightforward approach would be to reinvest a decreasing proportion of Treasury maturities or MBS principal payments over time.  This would result in a slower reduction in the portfolio and would smooth the pattern of maturities and principal payments to some extent.  Another approach could involve setting a maximum dollar amount of securities that would be allowed to mature or prepay without reinvestment in each month and to increase the dollar amount over time.  This would have a similar effect of slowing the reduction in the portfolio and would smooth the pattern of reductions more directly.  As with the strategy to begin to cease reinvestments that Beth discussed, these strategies could be executed based on a set schedule, or they could be contingent on continued improvement in the economy.  Further staff work could be completed to evaluate these and other options should the Committee decide to phase out reinvestments. Turning now to market expectations, as shown in the bottom-left panel of your exhibit, the median respondents to the Desk\u2019s Survey of Primary Dealers and its Survey of Market Participants expected both Treasury security and MBS reinvestments to cease approximately seven months after liftoff, but there was a wide range around this figure, with some respondents expecting reinvestments to cease at liftoff and others expecting reinvestments to continue for more than a year.  As shown in the bottom-right panel, respondents generally place the highest probability on reinvestments being gradually phased out over time.  The median expectation is that, should reinvestments be phased out gradually, this would be done over a period of about 11 months for both Treasury securities and MBS, though again, expectations for this are dispersed.  Overall, respondents generally expect the reinvestment policies for Treasuries and MBS to be similar. While market participants are generally not focused on whether a decision about reinvestments would be specifically calendar or state dependent, many note that they expect the Committee to be attentive to economic and financial conditions and to take account of potential disruptions to market functioning and liquidity in determining the  pace at which reinvestments could occur. In supporting this view, many cite the Committee\u2019s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans statement and other communications emphasizing a gradual approach to normalization.  Some policymakers\u2019 recent communications have reinforced these ideas, including the notion that a change in the reinvestment policy could be tied to the level of the federal funds target range. We should note that survey respondents and market participants indicate that they do not hold firm views about reinvestment, in light of the limited information available to them about the FOMC\u2019s thinking on this topic. The final page of your handout provides the questions circulated to you previously.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Beth and I would be happy to take questions. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Were there questions or comments.  President Williams", "   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I had a two-hander, which actually is more a question for President Williams or Vice Chairman Dudley, and maybe Governor Tarullo, too.  There seems to be an implicit notion that reducing the balance sheet will increase the probability of our hitting the zero lower bound.  I couldn\u2019t follow that logic.  Is it because\u2014maybe I should go with what the Vice Chairman said\u2014we think it would be very costly for us to ever increase the balance sheet again. Because if, when conditions are bad, we just go back up to $4 trillion, then I don\u2019t see the argument", "   MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Much of the staff memo on reinvestment combines discussion of our reinvestment strategy with discussion of how we communicate about our strategy, especially what forward guidance we might provide.  In fact, I think it\u2019s fair to say the memo is virtually all about the forward guidance regarding our reinvestment strategy, rather than the strategy itself. And I found this a little bit surprising, because just earlier this year we ended the practice of providing forward guidance on our interest rate policy and went instead to a meeting-by-meeting basis for setting policy.  And in our normalization plan document last September, we promised to give advance notice about asset sales, but we didn\u2019t give any similar promise about reinvestment strategy. So, like President Williams, I found it useful to think first about what strategy we want to follow about our balance sheet and then to think about how we want to communicate about it. Now, something stood out to me in the memo.  The memo provides two scenarios regarding macroeconomic variables\u2014one under an assumption of an early end to reinvestment and the other under an assumption of a later end to reinvestment.  The early scenario is taken from the June Tealbook, and so that involves a particular interest rate path, presumably chosen appropriately\u2014or the staff\u2019s view of what\u2019s appropriate, I\u2019m not going to quibble with that.  In the late scenario, the interest rate policy follows an inertial Taylor rule.  Now, because a later end to reinvestment by itself entails more accommodative policy, the funds rate is somewhat steeper in the later reinvestment path.  But it only partially offsets the effect of a later end to reinvestment.  The unemployment path is, accordingly, lower, and inflation, marginally higher. Now, the staff points out that a funds rate path could be chosen that in the model would completely insulate our goal variables from the balance sheet effects of our reinvestment strategy.  I\u2019ve argued in the past that these balance sheet effects could be quite small, but let\u2019s set  that aside and just take these effects as given.  I think it makes more sense to compare scenarios in which we are under the sort of complete-offset assumption.  In other words, under the baseline, we\u2019re assuming we\u2019re setting interest rate policy appropriately.  If we\u2019re looking at a different timing for reinvestment, I think the sensible thing is to assume that if we adopted that, we would also set interest rate policy appropriately, and essentially that means projections regarding our goal variables would be invariant under the two scenarios. So the main effect of the choice of reinvestment is on the path of our balance sheet.  We can sort of set aside unemployment and inflation.  Now, framed this way, that seems to a first approximation\u2014of course, there are second-order issues, too\u2014the useful way to think about it.  To me, the choice seems pretty easy.  I think an array of political economy considerations make it attractive for us to normalize the size of our balance sheet as soon as possible\u2014sooner rather than later. I think we\u2019d prefer as small a financial-system footprint as possible while maintaining the ability to accomplish our objectives and live up to our promise not to sell assets.  I conclude that we should end reinvestment all at once, and soon.  Ideally, a meeting or two after we start raising rates seems reasonable.  Under that strategy, the interval between liftoff and ending reinvestment is relatively short, so forward guidance isn\u2019t really that important a question. Now, it strikes me that we could easily make this decision about reinvestment on a meeting-by-meeting basis and, at the appropriate time, simply announce that we\u2019ve decided to stop reinvestment effective immediately in the same way we announced the beginnings of our quantitative easing programs and the beginning of tapering and the like.  That would be consistent with our decision earlier this year to back away from forward guidance on interest rate policy, to go instead to a meeting-by-meeting basis.  And I don\u2019t see why we need forward guidance on ending reinvestment. Let me just comment on the discussion about phaseout and market functioning.  I have a history of questioning the staff on what they mean by market disruption.  I think if we\u2019re going to take some step like slowing down the end of reinvestments or delaying on the basis of the staff\u2019s conjectures about market disruption, the Committee really ought to have a pretty concrete handle on what in the world that means.  If prices move, if they get volatile on a couple of days, if something like that happens, I\u2019m not sure why we should care, and I\u2019m not sure what that should mean to us.  If there\u2019s something more fundamental, like some computers breaking down, I\u2019d want to know about that\u2014maybe that\u2019s worth taking onboard.  But I think we need a more concrete account of what \u201cmarket disruption\u201d means before we actually act on it.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Thomas", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  Just to follow up on that.  If we were to stop the reinvestments very quickly, we might still be very close to the zero lower bound.  So the ability to offset seems a little bit inconsistent with starting the timing almost immediately.  You\u2019d be right if there\u2019s enough room, but if there\u2019s not much room, the ability to offset using the federal funds rate seems quite limited, so I think you\u2019d have to pick one of those two.  If you really want an offset, you need enough room to be very confident you\u2019re not going to hit the zero lower bound again", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  I wanted to follow up on President Lacker\u2019s attempt to build a theorem of invariants.  I think it would be valid except for the concerns we just heard about being willing to raise the size of our balance sheet when we get to the effective lower bound. So if we\u2019ve cut the size of the balance sheet, whenever we hit the effective lower bound, we\u2019re going to have less accommodation because of that cut.  So whenever we hit the effective lower bound at any time in the future, because we\u2019ve reduced the balance sheet\u2014assuming we\u2019re unwilling to raise the size of the balance sheet\u2014we\u2019re going to have less accommodation", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  And you have to also think of all the alternative paths that are foreclosed once you start to end your investments.  You sort of feel the ending reinvestments decision is not easily reversed. You\u2019re then forestalling all those paths where you would\u2019ve kept the balance sheet higher for a much longer period of time, and that\u2019s not really captured completely in the model because the model is based on creating one path.  It\u2019s not based on creating multiple potential outcomes. CHAIR YELLEN.  That\u2019s true", "  MR. LAUBACH. As you can tell, under the path with the later end of reinvestments, the federal funds rate does rise a little bit above the baseline", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Just so I understand the calculation\u2014so there were some estimates when we were going into the quantitative easing.  Are you assuming going out is symmetric so that it\u2019s primarily a balance sheet effect, not a flow", "  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes. Thank you, Governor Tarullo.  That was helpful.  I think we should be thinking more systematically and deliberately about what we want our long-run balance sheet to look like.  If we are really averse in the longer term to the idea of ever increasing the size of the balance sheet because of the institutional or political risks that others have mentioned, I think that consideration really should shape our thinking about what that long-   run balance sheet should be.  And I think it should also be shaping our thinking about when to initiate the phaseout of reinvestments.  I will say a couple of words about that in a minute. The other point\u2014and this has come up a little bit, but I\u2019ll try to emphasize it a little more\u2014is that the amount of accommodation associated with our balance sheet\u2014the size and duration of our holdings\u2014is not shaped by the rate of change of the size of our holdings.  So when we think about reinvestments, I think it\u2019s important to be doing that in terms of how they are affecting the size and composition of the balance sheet, not in terms of reinvestments per se. This probably matters the most in terms of mortgage-backed securities. Because they are redemptions, we are delivering pro-cyclical variation in accommodation.  You can imagine households and businesses becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy, of interest rates falling, and of mortgage refinancing increasing.  As the mortgages underlying those securities in our portfolio are prepaid, our balance sheet shrinks at a faster-than-expected rate. So we are removing accommodation exactly when we need it.  I think we want to be careful in thinking about reinvestment not in terms of the flow of reinvestments, but rather in terms of how it is affecting the stock of holdings on the balance sheet. Those are my high-level points.  I think we should be thinking more about what our long-term goal is in terms of the balance sheet, especially in light of what I hear, which is a feeling of concern regarding, or aversion to, initiating a new asset purchase program.  And we need to carefully reformulate our reinvestment policy to serve our balance sheet policy. That long-term goal, as I hinted at earlier, really should not just be shaped by a desire to get back to normal times.  I think we should be taking into account the fact that we a very bad outcome occurred that we didn\u2019t anticipate, and we should be keeping in mind that, as we go forward, we might want tools to deal with that kind of outcome.   Let me turn to the questions\u2014though, having said that, I suspect I won\u2019t be answering the questions because I am not a rookie.  I like the idea of a state-based approach.  A lot of you have talked about the challenges in communicating effectively about a state-based approach.  A couple of people\u2014I remember President Mester doing this, and I think First Vice President Holcomb also mentioned this\u2014suggested that we tie the initiation of phaseouts or reinvestments to the path of the federal funds rate.  So we could announce very soon that the phasing out of reinvestments will begin when the target range of the federal funds rate hits X percent. Now, what should X be.  Here I would disagree with some of the numbers I heard earlier.  I\u2019ve heard people would be comfortable with numbers like 1 percent for the target for the federal funds rate.  Remember what I said at the very beginning:  When would you be comfortable raising the effective lower bound for interest rates.  Maybe you\u2019re comfortable with that prospect at 1 percent.  I myself would not be.  I would think we would want a higher target range for the federal funds rate before we go through the relatively irreversible process of shrinking the size of the balance sheet. I think the staff could be helpful on this by giving us some simulations that would show us a probability of hitting the zero lower bound if we are at 1 or at 2 percent.  I think that it could provide an analytical framework for the Committee to think through those matters.  At that point, once we start, I would just announce that the evolution of phaseouts of reinvestments would depend on the evolution of the economy. Now, if you go with my 2 percent target range for the federal funds rate, that actually gives the Committee quite a bit of time to work on the details of the phaseout strategy.  Before you do that, though, I think a key part of that work is to settle as much as possible what the long-term vision for the balance sheet is.  President Rosengren mentioned that the Conference of Presidents\u2019 Financial Stability Committee went through a tabletop exercise in which two of us saw that actually selling assets might be a useful way to respond to a particular financial stability risk.  Well, if you want that as part of your vision, it should be affecting the size of your balance sheet.  If you are averse to ever buying assets again, that should be affecting the long-term size of your balance sheet.  All of these things should be going into thinking about where you want to be headed. Focusing on the size and the composition of the balance sheet, focusing on the long-term goals, and not being comfortable with initiating reinvestments until such time as you are really comfortable with the idea of raising the effective lower bound on interest rates\u2014those things should be connected in our thinking. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo", "MR. LOCKHART.  My thanks also to the subcommittee and the staff for moving forward on the SEP.  I\u2019ve thought for a long time that we could make some improvement.  I do support publishing medians as well as the other proposed changes to table 1 and figure 2.  I support making these changes with the next SEP submission and including notice of these changes in the minutes of this meeting.  I also support removing the top panel of figure 2. On the second question about the inclusion of fan charts, I\u2019m more skeptical.  I\u2019m not sure adding the proposed uncertainty bands would materially enhance the communications value of the SEP. I\u2019m not sure there is widespread misunderstanding today that the SEP numbers are subject to a lot of uncertainty.  I will wait to see the later construction of the fan charts, but my guess is that they may show very wide potential variance from the median of the projections.  I think, best case, this would provide information SEP readers already grasp, and, worst case, it would come across as hedging projections so much as to greatly dilute their seriousness.  In earlier years, I sometimes used the expression \u201cI am not entirely sure.\u201d  My late wife had a knack for cutting to the quick. When I said, \u201cI am not entirely sure,\u201d she would respond, \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know.\u201d  [Laughter]  The fan chart idea brought back that memory. As an alternative, if I were a market participant or an outside consumer of the SEP, what I would find useful is information on FOMC participants\u2019 forward-looking, subjective assessments of uncertainty. We\u2019ve discussed this before, and I still think it\u2019s worth an internal experiment.  We collectively have experience in generating simple subjective probability distributions from survey data.  The Desk\u2019s primary dealer survey, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s survey of household inflation expectations, and my own Bank\u2019s business inflation expectations survey come to mind.  I can support further work on adding some kind of uncertainty overlay on the SEP projections, but I\u2019d like to see that work include an option togenerate, as I said, forward-looking, necessarily subjective uncertainty measures concerning the specific forecasts in the SEP.  I think something like this would be useful to market participants and the public.  Thank you, Madam Chair", " MS. LIANG. As you know, the radar chart uses time-series data\u2014what you can capture in quantitative data and what you ex post now go back and look at.  If we were to use just this, we might assign a level of vulnerability to the financial system a notch lower than we are\u2014 which is, say, moderate, which is in the middle of the range\u2014because, as you say, everything here except for asset values is as low as it\u2019s been. There are a couple of reasons we don\u2019t.  There are things that I don\u2019t think you can capture in time-series data, so we apply judgment.  One is bank leveraging, for example.  I think with hindsight we know that capital was too low before.  Right now we\u2019re double that, but is that enough.  We don\u2019t really know, so we\u2019re withholding judgment on it.  There are also structural issues that don\u2019t get captured in time-series data.  For example, a money market fund vulnerability to runs is very difficult to capture here.  Perhaps we\u2019ve addressed that one.  But liquidity transformation is a different risk that we\u2019re hearing about and evaluating and that you can\u2019t capture here.  And the one that I probably worry most about is the off-balance-sheet leverage, which is really hard to see. Derivatives markets have changed a lot since the 1980s, and we just haven\u2019t been able to capture that in this yet.  Those are a couple of the reasons why we wouldn\u2019t just take this and say this is our assessment.  But it\u2019s useful because it does forceyou to think about, well, where are you relative to, say, the 1980s.  If you didn\u2019t see structural problems or missing data problems, you might just be able to use this", " MS. LIANG.  Right.  The FRB/US model, though, has a lot of structural modeling elements.  This, in contrast, is pretty statistical. Just to be clear, \u201calgorithm\u201d covers a broad range of approaches. But that\u2019s exactly right", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. There is a warehousing risk", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I thought it might be useful to give a brief discussion of the financial-stability tabletop exercise conducted by the Financial Stability Committee of the Conference of Presidents in Charlotte in June.  The purpose was to obtain a better understanding of how the nexus of monetary policy and supervisory policy tools could beused in a scenario in which financial stability issues were emerging. The exercise was based on the assumption that decisions were being made in 2017.  At that time, the scenario that was assumed was that the economy had attained both elements of the dual mandate and the economy was expected to remain at full employment and 2 percent inflation in the absence of any changes to our monetary policy stance.  The staff provided forecasts for both macroeconomic variables using Tealbook discussions as well as developments in financial markets.  The scenario also included signs of emerging financial instability. Specifically, the scenario included a rapid rise in real estate values, significant growth in the shadow banking sector, and increased risk-taking by non-SIFI financial intermediaries. The discussion of the scenario and possible policy responses highlighted the important role of both governance issues and time lags in many of the potential supervisory policy responses. In part because of these governance complications and the lags in supervisory implementation, some committee members thought that monetary policy tools should be considered to address the concerns about future financial stability, even though doing so would result in a less optimal macroeconomic outcome.  Other members wanted to use supervisory tools and margin requirements but did not necessarily rule out using a monetary policy tool at some later point. The exercise was useful in crystallizing potential financial-stability problems and the complexity of responding to those problems.  I\u2019ve shared the materials with Governors Fischer and Tarullo and think it might be worthwhile considering such an exercise for the full Committee at some future date.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you. First, on the tabletop exercise, it was a really good tabletop exercise because it wasn\u2019t obvious what the right policy solution was supposed to be, and people had quite a bit of disagreement.  So it shows there\u2019s a lot of nuance here in terms of figuring out how to use monetary policy versus macroprudential tools.  That was really very useful. I want to talk a little bit about Puerto Rico, which is in our District.  The Tealbook had a box on it, which I thought was quite good.  I think this is likely to be a very messy process because there is no bankruptcy option currently available for the territory of Puerto Rico or for its public corporations. Puerto Rico officials are seeking, with the support of the Administration, legislation that would provide a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing option.  This could either be narrow, which is what the Administration would support\u2014in other words, it would just apply as a public corporation, such as PREPA, which is the government power company\u2014or broad, which is what the commonwealth would prefer, and that would apply to all of the commonwealth\u2019s obligations. But the hurdle to even getting the narrow Chapter 9 legislation is high because many lawmakers are reluctant to set the precedent of providing this option.  Recall that U.S. states do not have the right to file for bankruptcy protection, although municipalities in states do have that option. So if you assume that broad Chapter 9 legislation is not forthcoming, it seems to me that it\u2019s going to be very challenging for Puerto Rico authorities to be able to restructure their Puerto  Rican debt on a voluntary basis before the territory hits the wall in terms of running out of financial resources.  This means that sometime later this year or early 2016, there really is a risk of a hard landing\u2014you can think of it as our own Greece\u2014with the potential of disruption to social services and even, potentially, social unrest.  When this will happen is hard to say.  There\u2019s really considerable uncertainty about how long the liquidity resources of the government and the Government Development Bank will last.  I don\u2019t really know when the timing of this might take place. Now, while a bad outcome in Puerto Rico seems quite likely, I do agree with the Tealbook\u2019s assessment that contagion risks seem to be low. Puerto Rico\u2019s problems are quite unique and are already well known.  Puerto Rican municipal debt, while sizable, only represents about 2 percent of the total tax-exempt market, and the bulk of the Puerto Rico outstanding munis have already been marked down sharply in price.  So a good portion of the pain has already been manifested in financial markets.  One other potential channel of contagion are the monoline insurers, which guarantee about $15 billion of Puerto Rican debt.  Their share prices have often fallen sharply, and they would clearly be hurt further if there was actually an outright default.  The good news is that the role of the monoline insurers has diminished very significantly since the financial crisis.  Monolines currently wrap only about 5 percent of new municipal bond issuance.  So the ability of states and localities to raise funding, even if Puerto Rico got into difficulty and the monoline insurers went out of business, shouldn\u2019t be disrupted unduly.  But this is something that could be very, very messy and difficult for Puerto Rico.  So you want to distinguish between the implications for the country and the implications for Puerto Rico\u2014sort of like Europe. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I suggest we take a 10-minute break.  There is coffee available, and we\u2019ll come back to start our economic go-round and, I hope, get through it before dinner. [Coffee break] CHAIR YELLEN. Why don\u2019t we get started on our economic go-round. We\u2019re going to begin with President Rosengren", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The reports from my business contacts and directors were similar to what we\u2019ve been hearing for several meetings now.  Most see demand expanding at a moderate rate and were reasonably optimistic about prospects for decent economic growth in the United States. But there was broad-based concern about international developments\u2014particularly about those related to China\u2014and on the pricing front, there were no reports of any pickup in inflation. To the contrary, anyone with exposure to commodity markets was talking about downward price pressures.   Let me start with the positive news for the United States.  The industries that I\u2019m going to mention are quite similar to President Mester\u2019s characterization as well.  Automakers and their suppliers were upbeat.  GM and Ford were pleased with the recent industry numbers, and both may again be revising up their forecasts for sales in 2015.  Each of them once again noted that low borrowing rates have provided important support for vehicle demand.  Also on the consumer front, my director who runs Discover credit cards said the company has seen a modest increase in retail usage over the past six weeks.  This is notable because earlier this year, he gave us a bit of an early read on the weaker PCE data that we ended up getting.  I received positive reports regarding multifamily residential construction.  Urban markets are particularly strong. On the other hand, businesses that manufacture heavy equipment continue to experience sluggish domestic demand, even aside from the weakness in their oil and gas-related businesses. Nevertheless, most contacts in this area are optimistic that energy-related investment will stabilize and demand from other sectors will pick up, leading to stronger equipment sales in 2016. I heard similar commentary about the demand for steel in 2016 from ArcelorMittal. The heavy equipment and steel manufacturers also have a lot of exposure to international developments, and here the story from them and my other contacts is pretty downbeat.  The largest worry is China. Indeed, several of my contacts characterized the situation there as \u201ctroubling.\u201d There\u2019s widespread concern that China will not be able to sustain the more modest 7 percent growth target laid out by the Chinese government planners.  Such an outcome likely implies continued softness for businesses with significant exposure to commodity markets and, more generally, for China\u2019s major trading partners. It could also further elevate the dollar, leading to stronger headwinds for U.S. economic growth and inflation. Combining my contact reports with the data we\u2019ve received over the intermeeting period, my forecast for GDP and inflation are essentially unchanged from my June SEP submission.  Adjusting for differences in our views about potential, my economic growth forecast is close to the Tealbook, and this results in resource gaps essentially closing by late 2016.  My inflation forecast has PCE prices rising 1.7 percent in 2017.  This is the same as the downwardly revised Tealbook projection, but my forecast builds in a later policy liftoff.  While these inflation forecasts are on the low end of the SEP submissions, I\u2019m still concerned that they may be overly optimistic. We\u2019ve seen little upward movement so far in core inflation.  Without something at least beginning to show up in the data, I find it difficult to write down a forecast that has inflation returning to target within the current projection period.  Indeed, the only statistical model we have in Chicago that generates a reasonably optimistic increase in inflation is one based largely on mean reversion to a constant, and that forecast still falls short of our 2 percent objective, even in 2017. In sum, the international situation presents an important downside risk.  I think we\u2019re well on track to achieving our employment mandate, but I\u2019m still worried about when inflation will finally begin to rise to 2 percent.  With the evidence in hand today and the knowledge of the uncertainty surrounding the inflation process, I cannot yet write down a baseline forecast that has us achieving our inflation mandate within a reasonable period of time.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Holcomb", "  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Dragging it in", " MR. TARULLO.  Beckett had his boy character appear only twice to announce that Godot would not be arriving today but would surely be arriving the next day, whereas we have heard predictions of accelerating wages and anecdotal reports of same more or less continuously during the past couple of years. Now, while Godot never did arrive, sending Vladimir and Estragon to the point of suicide, most of us probably believe that accelerating wages will.  There have been numerous efforts both inside and outside the System to determine just when that might  be, based on historical correlations between accelerating wage increases in post-recession periods and other labor market indicators. I want to mention a couple of relatively recent efforts by Federal Reserve economists that I found both interesting and well thought through.  But precisely because they turn out, perhaps, not to be correct, I think they\u2019re a cautionary tale about reading too much into any effort to create such correlations. One, which I believe hasn\u2019t been reduced to a paper yet but was presented within various parts of the System earlier this year, suggests that wages begin to accelerate when the post-recession unemployment rate has declined between 70 and 80 percent of the way from its recession high to its pre-recession trough.  The other, which is a little less numerically determinate, maps historical correlations between the quits rate and wage increases and concludes that a rise in the former is a good predictor of a later rise in the latter. That is a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Fed Letter\u2014it was just posted on the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\u2019s website.  With respect to the first, if my arithmetic is right\u2014not always a foregone conclusion\u2014we\u2019ve now already retraced more than 80 percent of the increase in unemployment from the pre-recession low to the recession high without noticeable and persistent wage acceleration.  And when I looked at the charts that were presented by the authors of that presentation, by the time that 70 to 80 percent had been reached, there was already a quite persistent and noticeable increase.  With respect to quits, while the quits rate has been rising for some years now, it has only relatively recently gotten back into the lower end of its pre-crisis range.  So it may be a little bit early to judge how well this correlation holds up in the present recovery.  If I read the paper right, President Evans, I think that paper was not actually trying to make a very firm numerical determination but was instead just trying to suggest directionally that this is when you can begin to expect some acceleration of wages.   My point, as in past discussions, is that the origins of the 2007\u201309 recession and the ensuing recovery in a financial crisis may mean that there will be very different trajectories in the labor market, as there have been in some other areas.  So we should remain open to the possibility, even the likelihood, that things won\u2019t be following the same pattern as they have been in the past several recessions and recoveries, and we have to instead look for nontransitory evidence in the data.  All of that, of course, is against the backdrop of the considerable uncertainty about the relationship between wage acceleration, even when it does occur, and price inflation. Turning to international factors, I want to talk about two that, again, several people have mentioned that carry some downside risk.  The first is China.  Now, I do not pretend to understand what is going on in China, and I certainly don\u2019t have very much confidence in my own assessment of the risks of a significant drop-off in economic growth there.  What I\u2019ve noticed is that people who speak to Chinese officials or who analyze data tend to discount the stock market turmoil and take a relatively optimistic view that China\u2019s growth will stabilize around where it\u2019s now reported to be, whereas people who do business in China tend as a group to be more pessimistic and view the overleveraged stock market as a harbinger of other problems. Being in neither group\u2014I guess that\u2019s not true because at FSB meetings, I talk to Chinese officials\u2014I can readily identify cognitive biases in both groups, so I don\u2019t know whose story is more convincing.  But what I think is relatively clear is that there isn\u2019t much upside risk in China these days. So, while the risks it poses to global economic growth and, through the mechanism of reduced demand for commodities, to downward pressures on inflation may be hard to quantify  for now, those risks are not balanced by any realistic upside risk that, say, Chinese economic growth is going to improve to between 8 and 9 percent over the next couple of years. On the dollar, the Tealbook already projects significant drags on U.S. growth over the next four to six quarters stemming from negative net exports, the reasons for which Steve explained in his introductory remarks.  Because the Tealbook also projects only a small additional increase in the trade-weighted value of the dollar during that period, what they\u2019re projecting is mostly a J-curve effect. But against the backdrop of the Tealbook\u2019s stipulation of a September federal funds rate increase, the Tealbook projection embeds the assumption that most of the capital investment shift associated with divergent monetary policies has already been priced into relative markets.  This may well be the case, but I think there are at least some reasons to think otherwise.  The first, of course, is the fact that rates have been at the zero lower bound here for more than six and a half years.  So there may have developed more entrenchment of positions that haven\u2019t moved so much, even in response to the increasingly explicit predictions of rate rises that many have been announcing. Second, any near-term increase in U.S. rates will have been accompanied by a decrease in effective rates in much of the rest of the world.  The only clear exceptions already are South Africa and Brazil, and the United Kingdom looms out there as potentially an exception along with us.  Accommodation has been enhanced significantly in both the euro zone and Japan through their QE programs.  This is a great statistic:  Rate reductions by central banks in the rest of the world have outnumbered increases 44 to 4 since the beginning of the year.  The 4 are, again, 2 in South Africa and 2 in Brazil.  So I wonder whether the traditional pattern of markets buying on rumors and selling on the fact may not hold true here, and whether there may be the potential for greater cross-border capital flows if we increase rates before either economic or financial conditions have become more mixed in the rest of the world.  The risk here is, I believe, a little more balanced than that with respect to China, because, if the Greek situation continues to be a problem mostly for the Greek people and not for the rest of the euro zone, one can definitely imagine the euro strengthening somewhat.  But I think it very unlikely that there would be a significant depreciation of the dollar when we start raising rates, whereas there is at least a modest risk of a significant appreciation.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  At the April meeting, I made the case that conditions warranted higher interest rates.  That case was based on the sustained improvement in real activity we\u2019d seen\u2014strong consumer spending growth and labor market conditions\u2014and the sense that forces damping inflation readings and depressing Q1 economic growth were temporary and likely to pass soon.  The forward guidance we had in place at the time, however, precluded such a move, and the economic consequences of lifting off just a meeting or two later seemed small.  That basic assessment of economic conditions didn\u2019t change for me in June, and,in fact, the data confirmed that transitory factors were dissipating.  I thought a strong case could be made for raising rates then as well, although, again, the consequences of waiting seemed small. As data have come in consistent with our outlook, the case for raising rates has been getting even stronger, making me less and less comfortable with further delay.  Lifting off at a meeting without a prescheduled press conference would be a bit awkward, however, because markets clearly do not expect a move except under unusual circumstances, despite our statements to the contrary.  But absent a significant unexpected turn in the data between now and our September meeting, I would oppose any further delay.  For today, I can support alternative B. By softening the requirement for further labor market improvements, it prepares us for a September liftoff, which I think will be appropriate. When we do lift off in September, I believe the language in alternative C is, for the most part, appropriate.  The one exception to this is in paragraph 3, in which I would delete the last clause of the last sentence, which says \u201cand will continue to support a strong economy.\u201d  At best, this clause is redundant, because we begin by saying \u201cpolicy remains highly accommodative.\u201d But I actually think it\u2019s a bit worse than redundant, because it\u2019s unbalanced relative to our objectives.  By singling out the real side, it risks reinforcing unrealistic expectations about the real effects of monetary policy in current circumstances.  With that deletion and without a marked change in the data flow, alternative C will work well in September.  In fact, it would work well today, and it would have worked well in June, too. Finally, let me say a word about intermeeting data.  I appreciate that we are and ought to be data dependent, but I don\u2019t think we should insist that the last smidgen of data be an uptick.  We should be mindful of the frequency with which one month\u2019s data reflect noise rather than signal.  Madam Chair, you\u2019ve emphasized the entire path of the federal funds rate.  That perspective suggests a focus on where economic conditions are likely to be a year or two down the road and what rate would be appropriate then, rather than the last month\u2019s smidgen of data.  Similarly, this perspective suggests evaluating current economic conditions in the context of how far we\u2019ve come over the past six and a half years since we reduced rates to zero.  In view of the millions of jobs the economy has added since 2009, it would seem perverse to delay liftoff if August payrolls fell short of expectations by, say, 100,000.  The intermeeting data should be broadly consistent with our assessment of economic trends, and the record that we\u2019ve seen that\u2019s documented those economic trends has included occasional hiccups in the data.  I think we need to be mindful of that as we approach September.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Holcomb", " MR. FISCHER.  Thanks.

If I may just quickly elaborate on some of the things that President Kocherlakota and also Chris mentioned.  You might think of this as if you kept the balance sheet permanently larger, you would have a permanent shift in the equilibrium real interest rate.  If you didn\u2019t accommodate that or didn\u2019t take that into consideration in your policy rule by moving the intercept appropriately, you would end up missing your inflation target permanently. Now, the policy rule has, of course, the 2 percent inflation target hardwired into it, so it would constantly push against the resulting inflation overshoot that would result from notadjusting the intercept of the policy rule.  But it\u2019s still the case that if you properly took into account the resulting shift in the equilibrium real interest rate in the policy rule, then you would end up reaching your inflation target over time. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019m glad to say I\u2019m comfortable with either version of the reinvestment language in alternative C and most other aspects of alternative C as well. Oh, but I\u2019ll leave that to tomorrow\u2019s discussion.  [Laughter]  I thought you might appreciate that. I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the staff memo, quite honestly picking up on most of the themes that were discussed in response to some of the questions and also Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s comments.  In terms of the staff memo, making decisions about the appropriate size of the balance sheet, I think it\u2019s very important that we weigh both the costs and the benefits under a wide range of plausible scenarios.  The memo emphasized one specific adverse scenario in order to illustrate a potential benefit of using a state-dependent rule for any reinvestments.  As was described in the memo and in the presentation, in this particular scenario, a state-dependent rule continues reinvestment for several years beyond the baseline, and the larger resulting balance sheet provides additional stimulus relative to the case of ending reinvestments on a preset path. But in considering the merits of such a state-dependent rule, we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the bigger issue of the relative costs and benefits of maintaining a very large balance sheet.  Indeed, taking the analysis of the memo to its logical extreme, we should always maintain a very large balance sheet, arguably even larger than what we have today, to provide insurance against negative shocks.  Now, I\u2019m picking up on something implied by Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s comment because, according to the Board analysis we discussed, a large SOMA portfolio lowers the term premium and effectively shifts the IS curve out, and this implies a higher equilibrium federal funds rate\u2014it\u2019s about \u00bd percentage point higher than baseline for the constant portfolio. What does that do.  It provides us with more buffer to use the federal funds rate as a policy instrument to respond to negative shocks. I see this memo not really being about this scenario or about the strategy for ending reinvestments.  Really, it\u2019s a question of, fundamentally, do we need a bigger buffer, especially in light of concerns about a continuing very low equilibrium real interest rate.  In a way, I think the memo narrows the question too much to just the specific language concerning how we would end reinvestments, and we really should think much more carefully about both the benefits more generally of having a large balance sheet, and also revisit the costs around that because the memo obviously can only cover the benefits.  Now, we\u2019ve decided through our discussions in the past that the costs of holding a very large balance sheet outweigh the benefits at most times, and we shouldn\u2019t lose track of that in thinking through some of these issues in terms of the reinvestment strategy, as opposed to just focusing on the benefits under certain scenarios. Now, I recognize I am veering into the topic of the long-run policy strategy that the Chair has initiated and is under way, but I do think this is an important issue to think about.  If we really do think we\u2019re in a world of a lower equilibrium real rate and we are worried about downside risks, I think we really should be thinking in very broad terms about what the costs and benefits of the balance sheet are.  And getting back to President Bullard\u2019s question, what do we really understand about the effects of the balance sheet on the equilibrium real interest rate, and what are these tradeoffs that we\u2019re facing. I think that the memo is fine\u2014I have no quibbles about the memo\u2014but it narrows this discussion down far too much.  The discussion we need to be having is about this broader issue of the costs and benefits of the balance sheet and not just thinking through this one experiment because, more generally, in a stochastic environment, we\u2019re going to get hit by both positive and negative shocks. Again, I\u2019m looking forward to the work that\u2019s being started in the work group with regard to the long-run policy initiative, but I do hope that this is one of the issues on which they give us better guidance, and sooner rather than later.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  All right.  Good.  Governor Fischer", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Maybe because I\u2019m the newer person, I\u2019m a little more sensitive and maybe even uncomfortable on two fronts as we do the execution.  I\u2019m sensitive to the fact that we have some uncertainty regarding the effect of beginning the process of raising rates\u2014that creates its own set of uncertainties, particularly when we start from the lower bound.  I\u2019m also particularly uncertain about the effect of beginning to phase downreinvestments.  Even though I agree with the overall debate and having that second discussion about the broader costs and benefits, I think, from an execution point of view, the one way we\u2019ll find out what the effect of doing each of these is when we do it. From a risk-management and prudence point of view, my own bent\u2014which is why I like the \u201cwell under way\u201d language you have here\u2014is to first make sure we are well under way when going through the first exercise of raising the federal funds rate, seeing what we learn, making sure we are in fact well under way.  Only after we\u2019re comfortable with that\u2014not only what the prospects are, but what we\u2019ve learned from that process\u2014can we then think about beginning the second process, which will have its own degree of uncertainty and learning that come from that. I\u2019d rather start that second process second, rather than intermingling these two at the same time. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It\u2019s been a very rich discussion already.  I have to admit that I was pretty surprised at the July meeting when it became apparent that more than a few FOMC participants viewed halting reinvestments as being a decision that would be very costly to reverse by reinitiating purchases or by beginning reinvestments again, as President Mester suggested.  I think this lack of reversibility is pretty crucial in terms of how we think about the appropriate long-run size of the balance sheet, the matter President Williams raised. If, as President Bullard and President Mester suggested, we\u2019ll just turn on this tool when we need it and, if we hit the effective lower bound and we need more accommodation, we\u2019ll begin reinvestments again or we\u2019ll begin active purchases again, then I think it\u2019s a very different question than if we view halting reinvestments as having enormous costs associated with it.  And then we have to weigh the political economy\u2014assuming that those costs are coming from political economy considerations\u2014against the political economy considerations that President Lacker pointed to, which are also very real in maintaining a large balance sheet.  These are very, very challenging issues. If we take as given this lack of reversibility\u2014and that\u2019s the way the memo drafted the problem and, in light of what I heard at the July meeting, I am very sympathetic to that way of drafting the memo\u2014this irreversibility leads to worse economic outcomes if we have to return to the effective lower bound.  As I argued at the July meeting, to me this means we should only be willing to halt reinvestments at a point in time when we\u2019re willing to increase the effective lower bound on interest rates.  Basically, halting reinvestments is taking a tool away from yourself.  You should only be willing to do that if you are actually willing to take away another tool, which is to increase the effective lower bound on interest rates.   My own thinking is, in light of where I think the long-run neutral real rate is going to be and given our recent experience, I\u2019m pretty loath to throw away these kinds of tools at this stage. My preference at this point would be to leave out any reference to reinvestment policy at the time of liftoff. I thought President Kaplan raised some great points, too, about the learning that\u2019s going to occur.  He hasn\u2019t been involved in these conversations before, so he hasn\u2019t gotten totally into the \u201cinside the tent\u201d kind of thinking that we all have about this, and I think that\u2019s good.  I think that having an opportunity to learn about how this process is going to work before starting to talk about a new thing that we aren\u2019t sure how it is going to work is wise counsel. At the time of liftoff, the Chair could say that this matter remains under study by the staff and principals.  I think it allows us an opportunity to dovetail our thinking about reinvestments with the longer-run operating framework exercise that the Chair initiated. One comment on the normalization principles.  The normalization principles certainly have indicated that the Committee likes having a smaller balance sheet. On the other hand, the normalization principles have also said we want to keep as large a balance sheet as is necessary to be able to conduct effective monetary policy.  That could be a lot larger than we thought it was going to be three or four years ago\u2014it might be larger than we think it is today.  I think this Committee will have to engage in some serious conversations about that. Now, assuming the Committee does want to make a reference to reinvestments, I\u2019m concerned about the vagueness of what\u2019s in the draft of alternative C.  If Committee members can agree among themselves to the idea of tying reinvestments to something specific in the outlook, something specific regarding the federal funds rate, as was done in the memo, it would be really great to offer that kind of clarity.  President Evans was chastising me for smiling at Chris\u2019s suggestion that we rely on the speeches of the presidents to elucidate what the Committee means by this language. The intermeeting period has not given me the kind of confidence that maybe I would like to have with that as a communications device.  [Laughter] As I\u2019ve indicated before, I think if we can agree on a tie to something like the federal funds rate, it would be really good to be able to make that connection as opposed to relying on everyone\u2019s interpretation of what that might mean.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  The language in the normalization principles that you referred to\u2014large enough to conduct monetary policy effectively\u2014my recollection is that the meaning of that was effective control of the funds rate, and I didn\u2019t envision it to be this large. But this wouldn\u2019t be the first time different Committee members had different readings of the same phrase", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think that the language is capable of bearing multiple interpretations", " MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, how do you want to proceed on this.  Because, it seems to me, this would be a change in the normalization principles or a change in what we said. CHAIR YELLEN", " MR. WILCOX.  I don\u2019t think we provide you with a graph of the markup of price over marginal cost in your Tealbook materials, but in putting together our inflation projection, the staff has pretty much written that relationship off as noninformative.  The FRB/US model, partly for a bit of intellectual diversity, hasn\u2019t chucked that specification overboard and views the high level of prices over marginal costs as posing a downside impetus on inflation.  And so that\u2019s mainly what\u2019s generating this difference", " MR. EVANS.  Just to close this out, is it fair to say that this implementation of the FRB/US model is putting less weight on the longer-term inflation expectations anchor than other analyses that we normally are looking at or the preferred inflation model that you\u2019re using", " MR. EVANS.  I\u2019m sorry.  Let me clarify.  Yes, it has that feature in there, but that\u2019s not enough to pull up the inflation forecast given the other countervailing data developments", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019ll start with a few observations from our District contacts over the past few weeks.  Those contacts were representatives of businesses and, this time around, of state and local government. Sentiment in the business community continues to be almost uniformly positive regarding conditions and the outlook.  Retailers reported good sales activity and optimism about future sales prospects.  Homebuilding and commercial real estate industry participants are upbeat. Auto industry contacts remain delighted with sales, trends, and prospects. Enough of our interviews occurred during the recent period of market volatility to give us a read on concern raised by those developments.  We detected little concern that momentum will be disrupted by global economic and financial events. Over this intermeeting cycle, we were attentive to perceptions of general conditions in labor markets and, especially, wage trends.  We got the clear impression that hiring challenges persist and have intensified.  A number of our contacts described significant labor shortages and are implementing new strategies to attract personnel\u2014for example, referral and signing bonuses. Firms are increasingly willing to spend on employee training to address skills requirements.  This was the fifth consecutive cycle of contacts in which we heard comments on growing wage pressures for selected job categories or in selected geographies or both.  It was noteworthy that, this past cycle, the District contacts yielded a more generalized sense of rising wage pressures. Turning to my outlook, my baseline forecast for growth falls in the 2\u00bd to 3 percent range over the next few years, which puts me on a stronger growth path than the current Tealbook.  My growth outlook is accompanied by continued absorption of labor market slack, broadly defined, and accelerating measured wage pressure.  I continue to have confidence that inflation will move to target in the medium term, but I\u2019m not very optimistic we\u2019ll see much improvement in the inflation trend this year.  I expect transitory factors, such as oil and commodity prices, will exert downward pressure on headline and core inflation measures for the next few quarters at least. This view lines up with the Tealbook. The only meaningful change in my assessment of the economy from the July meeting pertains to my sense of the balance of risks.  The recent volatility in the markets, apparently a response to increased uncertainty triggered by global economic and financial developments, has not subsided entirely as of this meeting date.  It\u2019s too early to know whether this episode amounts to a bona fide shock or just a nervous spasm in the markets.  It\u2019s also too early to detect any significant effect on the real economy.  I\u2019m not projecting a material effect, but evaluation of that question will require some time.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019m going to do the risky thing here and try to be more reactive to comments that have been offered around the table than I customarily would be. I will start with what President George just said, which is that the Committee should do more both internally and externally to emphasize the need to condition monetary policy on the outlook.  We should always be seeking to make policy to align the medium-term outlook for our goal variables of prices and employment with our longer-term objectives.  Now, when I say the term \u201coutlook,\u201d I mean to include risks to that outlook as well.  As President Evans emphasized, those risks really are all asymmetrically on the downside at this stage because of the zero lower bound and our inability to be able to respond effectively to those risks. What I heard from many around the table is a desire to incorporate other considerations besides the outlook into our thinking.  President Lacker started off by talking about how the Taylor rule had given very good outcomes for us in the past.  Embedded in the Taylor rule is a sense of the desirability to have interest rates close to their long-run normal level. President Lockhart talked about being satisfied with gradually moving back toward 2 percent over the medium term.  I think we want to be aligned between our medium-term outlook and our long-run goals.  We have to be more aggressive than that.  We want to be actually back to 2 percent. And, as President Evans suggested, taking into account the closeness to the effective lower bound, we might want to be willing to have some overshooting in the medium term in terms of our modal inflation outlook, just to guard against those downside risks.  Several people talked about being concerned about disliking rapid increases in interest rates.  Again, this is introducing a non-goal-oriented consideration into your policy decisionmaking.  To offer some context, when we\u2019re talking about rapid increases in interest rates, we\u2019re talking about increases faster than 25 basis points a quarter.  I want to offer that the baseline in the SEP is 25 basis points per quarter.  I think the Committee\u2014again, as President Evans mentioned\u2014would have a better alignment between its medium-term outlook and its long-run objectives by waiting and then raising rates at a slightly faster pace.  Something more like the 2004\u201306 pace, which I believe was actually viewed as fairly measured, would deliver a better outcome. The next few meetings and the decisionmaking around liftoff are really critical not just for the course of policy in the near term and how it\u2019s going to affect the economy, but also in terms of setting up the strategic framework of how the Committee is going to think about policy. We continue to be overly influenced by a collection of Taylor-like rules.  I suggested yesterday that this had served the Committee extremely poorly during the course of the recovery. To try to clarify one of my points in that discussion about November 2009, that was not a QE meeting.  It was a meeting in which the Committee had terminated QE1, and was thinking about, how do we best time the removal of accommodation\u2014specifically, the increase of interest rates\u2014with the improvement in the economy so as to best support the recovery.  The debate within the Committee, shaped by Taylor rules, had the dovish side in the 8s in terms of the unemployment rate and the hawkish side in the 9s.  I was there.  I was on the Committee at the time, so this is about self-reflection and self-criticism as much as anything else. This is about the problem with our framework that was in place before 2008 imprisoning the Committee into an unduly slow recovery.  We do not want to have that happen again.  The  way you don\u2019t have that happen again is by conditioning the policy decisions now about liftoff and afterward much more firmly on the outlook for prices and employment and by building in, I think, risk protections along the lines that President Evans has suggested. I look at what\u2019s happening in the world, and we look at all of the experiences countries have had in trying to escape the zero lower bound.  And I am drawn, Madam Chair, to alternative A.  I do not think that this is the time to be considering liftoff.  I look at what\u2019s been happening with regard to how financial markets are considering the credibility of our target.  Without meaning to be overly critical, as I listen to this debate, I can understand why financial markets are doubting the credibility of our target, because there\u2019s just a comfort level with, \u201cEventually, we have to get back to 2 percent.  It\u2019s got to happen.\u201d  That only happens if we make decisions to make it happen.  That is how we get credibility for our target.  That\u2019s how Paul Volcker got credibility for the target in the 1980s.  That\u2019s how we have to get there.  It\u2019s through our decisions. If we remove accommodation now, with inflation running as low as it is and projected to take as long as it is to get back to target, we are not sending the right message about credibility. I am drawn to alternative A.  I think that will set us up better to have a framework that is explicitly goal oriented.  It\u2019ll allow us to respond more effectively to shocks going forward, as opposed to putting weight on having interest rates at some normal level.  The only thing that \u201cnormal level\u201d should mean for this Committee is that we are hitting our price and employment objectives over the medium term. I\u2019ll close in terms of President Williams\u2019s point", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I support alternative B as written.  I was hoping that I could support lifting off at this meeting for two reasons.  First, it would have meant that we had satisfied our criteria of labor market improvement and confidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Second, as I said at earlier meetings, September is a better month to begin normalization than December, economic conditions and outlook being equal. Unfortunately, the global economy has not cooperated.  I think there are significant risks to the growth outlook that make it uncertain whether we will see further improvement in the labor market and whether we will see inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  In terms of what happens from here, I hope the international outlook improves and financial conditions stabilize.  If this happens and U.S. growth stays on track, then I could support lifting off relatively soon, certainly later this year.  I\u2019ve argued that December is not ideal in terms of market functioning considerations.  I don\u2019t think that should be sufficient by itself to deter us if everything else lines up in support of moving. With respect to moving in October, I don\u2019t believe we should rule that out as an option. But if we did move in October, that might demonstrate an urgency that would be difficult to  reconcile with the fact that we have relatively sluggish growth and still-too-low inflation.  People might be confused.  What\u2019s the rush of moving in October. I see the bar for moving at a meeting without a press conference as somewhat higher than that for moving at a press conference meeting.  I just think that\u2019s the reality.  So I\u2019d be surprised if, in six weeks\u2019 time, we got data that push us over the bar. I am very supportive of Governor Powell\u2019s comments. It would be good for the market to have a very high probability when we actually move.  If things cooperate and everything moves in a nice way, what I would prefer, rather than moving in October, would be to have a very \u201chawky\u201d statement in October that pointed very strongly to December, so that you could get all of that probability mass on December, and then just go in December.  I think that would be a better way to go.  Now, whether the world is going to cooperate like that, we\u2019ll have to see. Finally, I had a couple of comments on the so-called Yellen put.  We really have to disabuse people of this notion.  We care about the economic outlook.  Financial conditions matter in terms of affecting the outlook when they change, and if those changes in financial conditions are sustained, then we need to take them into consideration.  We need to explain that to people over and over again. I\u2019m sympathetic with Jim in the sense that this is a risk that people will take this reaction as a response to financial markets, but I don\u2019t think it is.  My views of why we should wait at this meeting have nothing to do with the fact that the stock market is a little weaker than it was before.  It has to do with the fact that there are actually some real things going on that are affecting financial conditions, and those changes have a risk for the outlook.  I think we need to explain that over and over again.  Thank you, Madam Chair.CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  I heard one suggestion in the go-round for a language change in alternative B, but I think most of you who support alternative B indicated your preference to go ahead with it as written.  So unless I hear a groundswell of support for some change, I\u2019d like to propose that we vote on alternative B as written. Matt"], "2015FOMC20151028meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  I think you may have misunderstood.  One premise was that we hold the nominal interest rate fixed at zero for a long time, and that would violate the assumption you just described of following the rule you\u2019ve implemented in your model.  I\u2019m asking about a different simulation than you just described, in essence", " MR. BULLARD.  I think one thing you could say is that the whole analysis is based on a unique steady-state equilibrium.  It\u2019s a linear model approximated around that steady state.  Even when you\u2019re at the zero policy rate, there\u2019s no other steady state that you can converge to or anything like that. The paper by Benhabib, Schmitt-Groh\u00e9, and Uribe says there is another steady state.  It is associated with zero policy rates, and that, they say, would exist in your model, but the way you analyzed it, either you\u2019re assuming there\u2019s no convergence to that steady state or you\u2019re just ignoring the steady state altogether. CHAIR YELLEN.  Maybe what I\u2019m going to say is consistent with what President Bullard just said.  Isn\u2019t there an argument that if you were to hold the nominal rate at zero, in spite of the fact that the equilibrium nominal rate would be higher, you would end up generating not lower but higher inflation.  And, the higher inflation went, if you kept the nominal interest rate at zero, the lower the actual real rate would move over time, the gap would increase, and you would get accelerating inflation. But that\u2019s equivalent to saying, instead of going to a steady state with lower inflation, you\u2019d actually be on the dynamic path that would be unstable", " MR. LACKER.  Yes. CHAIR YELLEN. Vice Chairman Dudley", "   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don\u2019t quite understand the intuition behind the attenuation.  I understand the attenuation when you\u2019re close to the effective lower bound, but when you\u2019re not at the effective lower bound, what\u2019s the reason why you would be lagging behind what you thought was the unbiased estimate of the r*. I mean, it would seem to me that if you were lagging behind with your unbiased estimate of the r*, you\u2019d be risking falling behind in inflation expectations and allowing them to get unanchored.  What\u2019s in the model that pushes against that.  I don\u2019t really understand the intuition behind the attenuation.  I get it at the zero lower bound, because you don\u2019t want to make a policy mistake and get pushed back to the zero lower bound, but when you\u2019re away from the zero lower bound, what\u2019s the intuition behind the attenuation. Are there features of the model that would generate that result. It just doesn\u2019t seem that logical to me", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But you\u2019re assuming that nothing bad happens when you\u2019re lagging behind.  In other words, inflation expectations don\u2019t respond to that because otherwise it could be explosive.  Let\u2019s imagine that r* increased and then you lag behind because of the Brainard principle. What happens then.  Don\u2019t inflation expectations start to get   unmoored because you\u2019re lagging behind what the correct policy should be. I just don\u2019t understand this notion that you always want to do less.  I understand it at the effective lower bound, but I don\u2019t understand the attenuation otherwise", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But the model sets things up so there\u2019s no cost to being late because, presumably, inflation expectations stay well anchored through this whole time period.  The model is sort of begging the result in some sense", " MS. MESTER.  Yes.  Exactly", " MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Like everyone else, I would like to thank the authors for their very good work, and I would add to their four papers, the paper sent to the FOMC by John Williams, one of those he wrote with Thomas Laubach, \u201cMeasuring the Natural Rate of Interest Redux.\u201d I was all ready to summarize everything, and then I looked at exhibit 13 and realized that they had copied what I was going to say and put it into their presentation. It\u2019s on page 13 of the handout, \u201cEquilibrium Real Interest Rates.\u201d  I think that it is a good a statement of what the overall findings are in the very interesting work that we have been presented. Obviously, the finding that everyone knows is that the natural rate of interest has fallen sharply and shows few signs of recovering.  That\u2019s happened since the start of the Great Recession, and it is a common finding among all of the papers.  There is, I think, another key point, and here I\u2019m going to diverge a little from what everyone has been talking about.  The point is that r* also depends on a set of other variables, some of which are policy-related\u2014for example, fiscal policy; productivity growth, I don\u2019t know to what extent it is policy-related; the real exchange rate, which is monetary policy-related; the relative price of energy; and demographics.  All of these are factors affecting r*, and I think we need to start talking about   what it is that moved r* more than using r* as a shorthand way of saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep the interest rate very low.\u201d I say that for two reasons.  I think we need to speak up much more about the policy responsibilities of other agencies in this town, including the fiscal authorities, which I know we are not allowed to do, but I am never quite sure why.  All other central banks do it.  And I suspect that productivity growth will have far more influence on future r* than what it is that we do with the interest rate.  The interest rate works through investment.  Since Solow\u2019s initial paper, there hasn\u2019t been another paper that says technical change is not the main driver of economic growth.  And I suspect we will end up there one day. I have been trying to figure out what is the use of r*. You read Wicksell, and it is either brilliantly simple or it\u2019s too simple.  It says there is a marginal rate of return on capital.  And when the interest rate is below that, then there is going to be a high level of investment and more inflation.  And when the marginal product of capital is below the interest rate, then we are going to get deflation.  And so there is a rate which will keep the price level constant. Well, that\u2019s what we calculate in our models, and we get a measure of r* that takes us back to a steady state of some sort over 12 quarters, and that\u2019s what we use.  But why don\u2019t we just use the models.  What is the extra that we get out of the r* as opposed to what we get out of the different models we consult when we are looking at different policies, which would take us to where we want to go. It was very interesting that one of the findings was that, using r* instead of a calculated optimal policy, you could actually do fairly well.  Well, that\u2019s an interesting reason to want to know r*. But how do you think\u2014I\u2019m asking the authors.  How do you think about r* and what its uses are.  It\u2019s obviously a shorthand for us.  But as we talk about it, I have a sense very much   that it gets more weight in our minds than it should, and that we should also be focusing on other variables. Well, to end, I was naive and I tried to answer the three questions.  I guess next time, if the other students would only tell me which questions you have to answer, I\u2019d do much better", "  [Laughter] MR. FISCHER.  Anyway, what does your estimate of current r* imply for the degree of accommodation provided by current monetary policy. I think almost everybody said it\u2014r* is somewhere around zero.  The real rate is somewhere around minus 1 percent, minus 1\u00bd percent.  So we have, I think, adequate accommodation, which will be higher when the inflation rate rises, I assume, or when productivity growth rises.  And, yesterday, in another meeting, some of us here saw a staff model forecast that I\u2019m not sure has been generally accepted by the staff, which showed productivity growth returning to 1\u00bd percent from next year.  I don\u2019t know if there is anything other than convenience in that chart. What did the exchange rate do to r*.  The appreciation probably temporarily reduced r*. And then the third one was, how do I expect r* to evolve, and what are the implications for the appropriate future path of the policy rate. Well, there is great uncertainty about future r*.  That is what is clear from the various factors that have been mentioned as determining it in the various papers that we have.  If productivity goes up at a reasonable rate, if animal spirits return, I assume that r* will rise.  If we stay stuck in roughly the equilibrium we are in now, I think that people will begin to be very worried that there is not much in the future and it could potentially fall. My bottom line is that r* is useful.  Which is what I think is said at the first line of exhibit 13: \u201cr* is a relevant, albeit complex, benchmark to guide the stance of monetary policy.\u201d Well, it\u2019s not a definitive benchmark.  It\u2019s not the pole star of whether monetary policy is right, but it is something useful that we need to consult.  But I think that if we want to get full analyses of the policies we are undertaking, we still need to use models.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", " MR. LAUBACH. Perhaps I can pick up on the upper-bound notion.  That really has to do with the possible persistence of shocks to inflation.  In that sense, rightly, this model takes the view that these shocks might leave a permanent imprint.  You might view that as one polar assumption.  You\u2019re right in pointing out that it matters a whole lot for the implications for longer-horizon inflation expectations whether, technically speaking, you have a unit root, or the root is 0.99.  It makes a huge difference as you forecast further and further out.  Of course, I\u2019d add that, sadly, for that reason, the data also don\u2019t speak very loudly on the matter, so we\u2019re presenting this estimate as an interesting case to consider.  But if you asked us about our confidence as to whether it\u2019s this assumption or what\u2019s built into the standard model, it would be very difficult for us to confidently say anything about which of the two it is.  As you know, even in our standard model, there\u2019s some persistence\u2014at the 5-to-10-year horizon, you can generate   some decline in inflation expectations, and so it doesn\u2019t revert back very quickly.  Nonetheless, it matters a great deal whether you move to the possibility that you literally have permanent imprints on inflation expectations.  I wish we had greater ability to discriminate confidently in the data between these two", " WILLIAMS.  Yes.  I have a couple of questions around financial stability, but these charts also appear in the Tealbook, so it can be a free-for-all. In the QS report, chart 1-11 shows cap rates in commercial real estate, which you mentioned are at very, very low levels\u2014in fact, I would say the lowest we\u2019ve seen since 2006 and 2007.  Also the price-to-rent ratios in residential real estate are in chart 1-14.  I don\u2019t just want to think about financial stability, I want to think about risk to the macroeconomic outlook, because when I talk about financial stability, we immediately go into leverage of banks and this and that.  I\u2019m actually also focused on risk to economic growth.  Which should I think of as the  better metric, or measure, of risk to the economy. Is it the price-to-rent ratio relative to a historical norm, a cap rate relative to a historical norm, or a cap rate that\u2019s adjusted for where interest rates and other right-hand-side variables may be. It could be, as we saw in the mid-2000s, that basically all assets were overvalued, and so when you compare commercial real estate cap rates with Treasury securities, everything looks great because everything is in a frothy state while, in fact, there are problems all over the place. Also, in the house-price-to-rent ratio, you have this long-run trend that, as I understand from the footnote, reflects not only some trend in the house-price-to-rent ratio but also carrying costs, which I take to mean interest rates and things like that. The way I read the house-price-to-rent ratio is that the house prices are about 35 percent above their historical norms, but once you put in this trend and the carrying costs and other things, it actually looks pretty good. Going back to my question, when we think about macroeconomic risks, should I be thinking about the 35 percent, should I be looking at cap rates being really low, or should I be saying, \u201cMaybe I can justify all of this because of very low interest rates.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t a leading question, it was supposed to be", " WILLIAMS.  But then that would argue, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me cap rates are low because Treasury yields are low, so that\u2019s okay.\u201d  But I also don\u2019t quite understand where this long-run trend that\u2019s in both the Tealbook and the QS report really comes from.  To what extent is that some view about trend price-to-rent ratios\u2014which I don\u2019t have a good understanding of\u2014or to what extent is it really reflecting just interest rates.  At the last FOMC meeting, I said house prices were roughly 30 percent overvalued based on a chart like this, and of course the Tealbook says that\u2019s not correct, they\u2019re actually overvalued by 6 percent.  I want to know the right way to think about the risk to the outlook.  Maybe they\u2019re both good ways to think about it, but it\u2019s a question.  It\u2019s a leading question", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This follows up on one of Andreas\u2019s charts.  Recently, a number of economic research papers have focused on assessing theinformation content in credit spreads.  Not so long ago, we were concerned that credit spreads were unusually low, suggesting an underpricing of risk.  It is noteworthy that spreads have moved from their unusually low levels.  Particularly at a time when we are actively considering tightening monetary policy, it is somewhat incongruous that we are seeing credit spreads reaching multiyear highs last seen several years ago when concerns over European problems were particularly acute. It should be noted, however, that at these levels, the spreads on high-yield bonds relative to Treasury bonds are significantly below the peaks seen during the financial crisis.  If one looks at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch high-yield corporate bond index, high-yield spreads have risen 267 basis points since June 2014.  Although this increase has certainly been aggravated by the oil and commodity downturn that has significantly affected firms in those industries, the rise in high-yield bond spreads is not coming from that sector alone.  For example, when the energy sector is excluded from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch high-yield index, high-yield spreads ex energy have widened 210 basis points. One explanation for the higher yield is concerns about the future growth of the economy.  However, if so, concerns being expressed in bond spreads are at variance with our discussion on policy and the need to tighten rates.  An alternative is that high-yield securities are now viewed as being more risky because of loosening underwriting standards and the previous willingness of investors to hold riskier assets. If so, we should be considering the implications for how these changes in high-yield bond characteristics may affect the performance of these bonds in a future downturn, as well as how such a downturn might cause investors to rapidly reduce their willingness to hold risky assets, further adding to any instability in bond markets.  Thank you, Madam Chair.   CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", "  MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I often say in public remarks that the Federal Reserve has a much better understanding of financial system vulnerabilities and risks than it did a decade ago.  I feel safe in saying that because of the work of the QS group, and I want to thank Nellie, Andreas, and the other QS contributors from all around the System for their thorough and thoughtful measurements and analysis. As I suggested earlier today, I believe that r* will be low for many years to come.  If so, the FOMC will achieve its dual-mandate objectives only in the presence of signs of financial instability, like high and possibly volatile asset prices.  This observation suggests to me that financial-stability considerations are likely to be a central consideration at FOMC discussions for years to come.  The Committee will need to become even more systematic in its approach to these issues. There are two key points as you think about how to become more systematic.  First, as already noted, our statutory mandate is to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment.  I see financial stability mattering for this Committee only insofar as it affects the risks to the outlooks for inflation and unemployment.  The stance of monetary policy should not be influenced by a risk that some bondholders or collection of bondholders will lose money because of a rapid rise in term premiums.  A relevant question for monetary policy is whether such a sudden revaluation of bonds lead to a decline in employment and prices that is not readily addressable using ex post monetary policy tools.  We need to have a way to trace the manifestations of financial instability into price and employment outcomes. The second issue is, we need to know how changes in monetary policy would mitigate financial-stability concerns, mitigate the risks that I mentioned earlier.  Right now, I\u2019m not sure that I even know the signs involved, let alone the magnitudes.  For example, if we\u2019re concerned   about undue increases in house prices that could eventually lead to a housing bust, should we address the stability concerns by removing monetary accommodation to slow the rise in house prices or by adding monetary accommodation to cushion an eventual fall. Presumably, it depends on the position you are in the cycle, but, as we know, that timing is hard to judge. As I said at the beginning, I feel the current financial stability briefing process has served the FOMC well, but I see it only as a first step. The current approach implicitly treats financial stability as an add-on concern for the Committee\u2019s consideration.  The Committee and its staff should aim for the financial-stability briefing to be more seamlessly integrated into Tealbook A.  Let me be somewhat more specific about what I have in mind.  Tealbook A currently focuses on how monetary policy influences the modal outlook, which is grounded in the certainty equivalence principle that emerges from quadratic objectives. As I\u2019ve discussed both here and in various conference settings, we can incorporate financial-stability considerations by seeing them as a way in which monetary policy influences the risks to the outlook beyond just the modal outlook itself.  I would say the ultimate goal should be a Tealbook A that allows the Committee to gauge, in a systematic and quantitative way, how its monetary policy decisions will influence both the modal outlook and the risks associated with that outlook.  I\u2019m optimistic that through the collective effort of QS and monetary economists around the System, this goal could well be achievable in a couple of years. I was at the conference that the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston hosted on macroprudential tools\u2014a great conference\u2014and Lars Svensson presented some interesting work that started to push in this direction, and he threw down a gauntlet.  As those of you who have heard Lars before know, he\u2019s done that before.  He challenged people to find big effects of monetary policy on employment and price risks through financial stability.  He was not able to find very much along those lines in his own calculations.  While it\u2019s not the way the System should think about financial stability, I think it would be great for this Committee to have a more integrated approach.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you", " MR. BULLARD. Yes, I have a comment on exhibit 1.  This is interpreting people through the lens of this particular model.  People could have other materially different models that have very different implications for the real rate of interest", " MR. BULLARD.  I think it\u2019s interesting to look at this, but it\u2019s not clear that everyone is using exactly this model", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019m going to turn to exhibit 2 and the panel on alternative B.  The last bullet says that alternative B leaves the Committee \u201cwide latitude\u201d at the December meeting.  When we discussed the changes in language in alternative B, particularly paragraph 3, at the Minneapolis Reserve Bank, we were concerned that those changes did not leave the Committee with a lot of latitude at the December meeting. Let me explain our thinking on that.  If the Committee were writing the very first FOMC statement of all time, it would be true that considerable latitude would be left by that language at the December meeting.  That is not the case.  The Committee is choosing with intention to bring up a specific reference to the next meeting at this time. Our concern was that it would be read by market participants as signaling a relatively strong intention on the Committee\u2019s part to initiate liftoff in December. Clearly, the staff here had a different perspective on this.  I\u2019d be interested in hearing your thoughts", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I think I would grant your literal reading, but it\u2019s really about the choice to make the change to this particular wording at this time, signaling an intention", " MR. LAUBACH. One question is whether the public will look at this and say, \u201cWell, they could have said it a lot more pointedly, but they chose to say something fairly hands-off.\u201d So it at least admits the interpretation that the FOMC is not yet very certain that it will want to lift off at the December meeting.\u201d  But how this will be interpreted by market participants, for example, is very difficult for me to predict", " MS. BRAINARD. On the same point, I also reacted to the \u201cwide latitude\u201d as perhaps a little out of context with what I\u2019ve been reading in the market newsletters, which have been looking very carefully at this language.  If we say \u201cwhether it will be appropriate to raise the target range . . . , the Committee will, based on . . . ,\u201d I think that will be seen as a lean and as providing wide latitude.  When we also add \u201clater this year\u201d or \u201cat its next meeting,\u201d that closes the latitude a bit and leans even further.  So it\u2019s a question at this juncture as to whether that additional precision regarding \u201cat its next meeting\u201d and \u201clater this year\u201d really does not just boost the probabilities\u2014something that I understand is the intent here\u2014but also locks us into something that we then will need to try to figure out how to exit, if the world doesn\u2019t turn out the way we expected", " MR. ROSENGREN. I have two quick observations.  I do think, like Governor Brainard, that if we say \u201cat its next meeting,\u201d that indicates \u201cprobable,\u201d not \u201cpossible.\u201d  If we actually want \u201cpossible,\u201d something like \u201csoon\u201d would be a fuzzed-up word.  I think we have to distinguish between what we would prefer and what we think we\u2019re signaling.  I would prefer to say \u201cat its next meeting,\u201d because I\u2019d rather make it probable.  But if the goal is to make it possible, I would probably just say \u201csoon.\u201d  Everybody can have a different view of the English connected with this, but I do think that, when you add a specificity of \u201cat its next meeting,\u201d it focuses the attention and the rest of the caveats get lost. That\u2019s just my own view of the English.  After the go-round, we can get a sense of where the Committee is on that. The question I had was on alternative C. Assuming that the economic conditions come in such that we actually are planning on taking action at the December meeting, I\u2019m wondering whether the language in alternative C gives enough information about the rate path.  If part of the goal would be, in effect, a dovish first tightening\u2014which is to say, we are tightening, but the path we\u2019re taking is expected to be very gradual\u2014I\u2019m not sure the current version of C conveys that to the extent that I might want. So, as you\u2019re thinking about the next meeting, if it does seem to be appropriate, I\u2019d suggest maybe rethinking that paragraph a little bit to more strongly indicate the path. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, and, in a moment, I\u2019ll refer to the language issues that have been raised.  I want to say a couple of things first, though, and they center on this issue of whether we now have to move because people have suggested we\u2019re going to move and there was some expectation that we were going to move.  I think the optimal approach to policymaking is, before you say something, to be pretty sure that what you say is what you\u2019re going to do.  But the second-best is not to go ahead and do something that is ill advised because you suggested to people beforehand that you might do it.  The second best is to treat your earlier suggestion as essentially some variation on a sunk cost and then go ahead and do what makes sense. The first point I\u2019d make is that this, to some degree, is a self-inflicted wound.  I agree with people who have said that there\u2019s a lot of confusion out there, and that there was an expectation as well as a lot of discussion centering on September.  How could the markets and the commentators not be focused on September when so many of us were out talking about September. This notion that, \u201cGee, the markets have focused on September\u2014we\u2019d better do it,\u201d is somehow linked to the way in which our public statements have been date and calendar centered rather than talking about the narratives, as I put it yesterday, or the outlook, as many of you refer to it, that would guide our sense of when it\u2019s appropriate to move.  There is a lot to what President Williams and others have said about there being some sense of, do we know something that the markets don\u2019t know.  But I think we\u2019ve created that problem, and we\u2019ve created it by talking about dates.  For so long, President Bullard was trying to get us off dates and onto state contingency.  We finally got off of dates, and then we immediately went back to talking about them, which I just don\u2019t think has been helpful. The second point is, I\u2019m still having some trouble with \u201cact sooner so that you don\u2019t have to make a big move later.\u201d When I say I\u2019m having some trouble, I don\u2019t mean I reject it, but I am having some difficulty understanding it for two reasons.  One reason is\u2014I assume we all agree with this\u2014the effect of an increase of 25 basis points in the target range will be substantially greater than what the models say an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate will be. The increase is reversing a lot of positions.  It\u2019s reversing a psychology.  It\u2019s going to have a big effect.  I keep getting told by CEOs to expect a lot of turbulence when it happens.  Now, that is not a reason not to do it.  I agree with Jeremy Stein\u2019s notion that we cannot be driven by what the bond market reaction is going to be.  We sometimes just have to fly through that. But I do think there\u2019s going to be an effect, and there\u2019s going to be a tightening of financialconditions well beyond what 25 basis points would normally suggest, particularly when, as yesterday\u2019s discussion pointed out, 25 basis points is probably a good bit of the way toward what almost everybody would agree a neutral rate is. It\u2019s not as though we think, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go, so this is just a little bit.\u201d Now let me turn to the language itself.  I don\u2019t have a view on paragraph 1, Madam Chair.  Whatever you want to do on that is fine with me. On paragraph 3, I would have preferred no change to the language at all\u2014that is, keeping what we said in September\u2014but it\u2019s obvious that that\u2019s not where the center of the Committee is.  So I actually thought that the formulation of shifting toward saying the question we\u2019re asking is whether\u2014or, in President Lockhart\u2019s formulation, when\u2014it\u2019s appropriate to raise rates, as opposed to talking about how long to maintain the existing target range, is, as I said, a clever way to signal that the question of an increase is now on the table.  I believe that language change cannot help but be noticed by people and will have the desirable signaling effect.  Although, again, my preference would be no change in language, understanding where the Committee as a whole is, I think this was a much better way to do it than the formulation that was in the original alternative B that was circulated.  However, on the inclusion of \u201clater this year\u201d or \u201cat its next meeting,\u201d coming from my policy position, I\u2019m likely to be biased against making it probable as opposed to possible.  I think President Rosengren is right. It will make it seem probable, and that\u2019s not where I want to be.  I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s where the Committee is prepared to be right now as to wanting to keep it on the table. By the way, if there\u2019s a sentiment favoring removal of the reference to \u201clater this year\u201d or \u201cat its next meeting,\u201d I think President Lockhart\u2019s suggestion to say \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cwhether\u201d would be fine. Finally, for the reasons John has already articulated\u2014which will keep my intervention shorter\u2014I don\u2019t think \u201cbased on incoming data\u201d is helpful because, to the degree that we want people to think that we\u2019re looking at the data, they already know that, and John said well why.  It may give an undue emphasis on a couple of pieces of data. That\u2019s it, Madam Chair.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Did you have a view, Governor Tarullo, on \u201clater this year\u201d versus \u201cat its next meeting\u201d", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will support alternative B today.  On the statement language, I would like, if I could dial this in perfectly, to have the market price in a  percent probability of liftoff in December. Then I would like the data to move it up and down from there as we move toward the meeting.  For that reason, on the language, I like the red language \u201cwhether it will be appropriate to raise the target range,\u201d and I like \u201clater this year.\u201d I could live with \u201cat its next meeting,\u201d but I like \u201clater this year\u201d for the reasons that Governor Tarullo articulated.  I am actually attracted to President Williams\u2019s idea of eliminating \u201cbased on incoming data,\u201d because, in this context, it puts a bright spotlight on the two I employment reports and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how we should make policy.  So I could lose \u201cbased on incoming data.\u201d  That\u2019s what I would do there. Implicit in that is that if the economy continues on the current path, with job growth sufficient to continue to materially reduce labor market slack, I would support liftoff at the December meeting, and I would present such a decision in a context of a very broad agreement among the membership of the Committee that the path of rate increases will be a gradual one. For me, the tightening cycle can be very slow.  The market path does not trouble me, although, of course, the data will dictate that. The question is, why move at all in December. Why not wait another three months or six months\u2014or even a year or two years.  And I would offer two considerations.  First, I believe that the test that we\u2019ve articulated will be met if we get one more cycle of solid data.  I also believe that a well-telegraphed move of 25 basis points, presented in a context of a very broad Committee consensus favoring a shallow path, should not have a sustained material effect on financial conditions. Second, I would point to the Committee\u2019s own communication, and let me be clear: I\u2019m not arguing here that we should mistakenly do this because we\u2019ve said we would.  I\u2019m arguing that, in a close call, I would lean toward going if we get a chance to do that.  I don\u2019t think it   would be a mistake.  The reason is, we\u2019ve carefully guided the public to expect liftoff this year.  Many on the Committee, including me and many others, have publicly embraced that expectation.  The September SEP has 13 of the 17 of us supporting liftoff this year.  In the September SEP, we had median expectations regarding second-half real GDP growth of 2 percent and unemployment at 5 percent.  Those will be met, hypothetically.  I think there will be a cost to appearing to change our minds, and we would simply need to weigh the benefits against that cost.  I guess I would really like to move past this essentially tactical decision about the precise date of liftoff and shift the focus toward the very broad agreement about the gradual path. With that backdrop\u2014and here I echo what others have said\u2014I suspect that a decision not to move in December will not be, and will not be seen by the public as, just another step in a data-driven, meeting-by-meeting evaluation of policy but rather a fundamental change in the Committee\u2019s framework as it\u2019s been expressed in communications this year. One implication would be a sense that we are seriously troubled by the path of the economy.  An additional implication would be a significant further period at the effective lower bound.  Any restatement of our objective function risks setting the bar at a level that may not be met for a year or more. In addition to the costs of appearing to change our mind, I am concerned with the buildup of financial and economic imbalances over time if, in fact, we\u2019re going to remain at the zero lower bound for an extended period. The question is how high to set the bar for incoming data between now and the December meeting\u2014particularly on two payroll reports, if I can admit that.  I would simply say that I would not be setting it excessively high.  I\u2019ll end with the thought that I really do believe it\u2019s essential that for the period ahead we see economic growth above its trend rate.  Otherwise, I\u2019m   not sure why we are raising the federal funds rate.  But if we do see that by some reasonable margin, I will be prepared to go forward.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester", " MR. BULLARD.  I agree with those around the table who said that the goal here is to reel in the market expectations of when the liftoff will occur.  The goal is to put some more probability on December.  If we could get that above 50 percent, it would be good.  If we can\u2019t, then we might have to follow up with communications after the meeting.  I don\u2019t know how that would work.  But I think the basic idea is that September was perceived as more dovish than at least my interpretation of where the Committee is, and that the markets have moved way out, some into 2017, on when they think liftoff will occur.  This is part of what\u2019s making me very concerned that we\u2019ll just get stuck with ZIRP long term. I agree with Governor Fischer on the implications of not moving in December.  I think the words he used were, \u201cThat would indicate we just don\u2019t like the economic outcomes we see,\u201d and I believe that\u2019s right.  The argument about normalization is an argument about cumulative progress.  To mix that up with what\u2019s going on day to day in the economy is mixing two types of arguments.  If we don\u2019t like the way the economy is performing, that\u2019s fine, but the Committee should just admit this and then chart a new course for policy.  Governor Fischer laid out some possibilities in that case. I agree with John Williams and others\u2014we can\u2019t continue to wait indefinitely on this.  We\u2019re sending a pessimistic signal on the economy that might be unwarranted. Governor Tarullo has made comments about the \u201cdata dependent\u201d sentence, and I actually agree with him on this.  In this context, having that data dependence is really going to put a lot of pressure on the various reports that come out.  Most likely, they\u2019re going to be muddled.  We\u2019d do better by saying we\u2019re going to focus mostly on cumulative progress.  I agree with everyone who says you don\u2019t want to make this interest rate move in an environment of a slowing economy.  I appreciate that. But as long as we can make the case that we\u2019re okay and we can cite cumulative progress, we should be able to get off zero in December.  I agree with the Governor even though I have been the big advocate of saying, \u201cWe need state-dependent policy, and we\u2019ve got to depend on the data.\u201d  But it does have this feedback to us that every little wiggle in the data is something that\u2019s going to change FOMC policy. I agree with Governor Powell that if we don\u2019t move in December, we\u2019re going to have to consider a fundamental change in the policy outlook advanced by the Committee\u2014how we\u2019re thinking about normalization and how we\u2019re thinking about our framework as we go forward.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Can I suggest that we first decide whether we want one of the two bracketed languages. CHAIR YELLEN.  That\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting.  Why don\u2019t we first decide whether we want some reference to the next meeting.  Do we want one of the bracketed options, or some other option.  Governor Powell", " WILLIAMS.  Can this problem be solved through the minutes.  Would the minutes summarize the sense of how the voters interpret this. I actually don\u2019t like this \u201cpossible\u201d versus \u201cprobable.\u201d  I think that is actually separating us.  \u201cProbable\u201d sounds like \u201chighly likely,\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d sounds like \u201cunlikely,\u201d depending on which side you\u2019re on", " MS. BRAINARD. Yes.  If the minutes were to state that we saw roughly equal odds, that would be very meaningful.  But I\u2019m not sure I was hearing that around the room.  But if people think that\u2019s something that could comfortably appear in the minutes, I believe that does do what Jay was suggesting, which seems effective. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. With those provisos, my recommendation would be to keep in one of the bracketed options, and then that takes us to which bracketed option to keep in.  I heard support for both of the options.  I think we\u2019re a little bit divided on that.  Either way, both of these options point to December.  \u201cLater this year,\u201d I think, can only be our next meeting.  I guess a reason to have that language is, it\u2019s language we\u2019ve used\u2014I\u2019ve used it repeatedly\u2014so it\u2019s playing off that.  An advantage, in a way, is that it is a one-shot-only thing.  It has to be removed in December.  My own view is, if we\u2019re not comfortable moving by December and we feel the economy is too weak, then we really have to change our communications substantially.  To me, that\u2019s an advantage, and I heard some of you echo that thought.  \u201cAt its next meeting\u201d is also very explicit about December.  It is language that we could keep meeting after meeting, but, frankly, even though we could, I think it\u2019s unlikely that it would be desirable to do so.  If we don\u2019t move in December, we really need to rethink our communications and not keep markets on tenterhooks all the time, thinking that we\u2019re just on the verge of moving.  But I can live with either one of these things.  So let me ask, how many people prefer \u201clater this year\u201d. [Show of hands]  How many people prefer \u201cat its next meeting\u201d", " MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, it\u2019s up to you, of course, but I agree with Presidents Lockhart and Kaplan here.  I think it is a bit confusing, and we already had this language in here. CHAIR YELLEN. Governor Brainard"], "2015FOMC20151216meeting.txt": [" MR. ROBERTS. We tried to get the improvement in the output gap right for 2014.  Of course, the changing output gap is just the difference between real GDP growth and potential GDP growth.  And we saw in 2014 that labor market conditions were improving very rapidly.  The unemployment rate was coming down quite a lot, so we thought, \u201cOh, the output gap must be improving a lot.\u201d So what we essentially did was to say, \u201cHmm, with GDP growth not as strong as it should be to get that kind of an improvement in the output gap, there must have been some measurement error in the actual GDP numbers.\u201d  And because we don\u2019t have room in our accounting system right now for measurement error, we put the measurement error in potential GDP. This is something we are thinking a lot about.  In the research of mine that you cite, we do have an explicit role for measurement error, but that isn\u2019t something that\u2019s in our traditional accounting systems.  One could imagine a more elaborate system in which you break down real GDP into not just the two components, of potential output and the output gap, but into three components:  potential output, the output gap, and measurement error.  So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on there", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a question on John\u2019s exhibit 4, \u201cA Recession at the ZLB,\u201d which obviously was also in the alternative scenarios in Tealbook A.  As I read from the text and from your presentation, if I look at the blue dot-dashed line\u2014which indicates that you are not imposing a zero lower bound, you are not imposing anything\u2014you are actually doing two things with the funds rate here.  You have a baseline assumption about some kind of Taylor rule with inertia, but then you are also dropping the funds rate by 275 basis points to show a typical or a strong reaction to the recession.  So it is a combination of these two effects.  And then, on the zero lower bound, you are constraining it at essentially 10 or 12\u00bd basis points. I have one technical question, which is, I am puzzled by the fact that the red dashed line with the zero lower bound is almost always\u2014by just my looking at panel 5 in the exhibit\u2014above the blue dashed line, which goes against economic intuition.  I understand it is above at the zero lower bound, but it wouldn\u2019t be that way, for example, for 2018.  Even though the economy is worse off, the funds rate is higher.  So I was curious about really what\u2019s going on here. And the second issue, which is kind of more related to the box in the Tealbook about the effective lower bound, is I would be very interested to see what would happen if, when you do these kinds of scenarios, instead of a zero lower bound, you used a negative 50 basis point or a  negative 100 basis point lower bound, given the experience in Europe, and in light of what we\u2019ve learned from that, which is reported in the Tealbook, just to kind of give us a flavor of, in a situation like this, if we could go to negative rates.  And if we had a view on how that would pass through to financial conditions, how much of an extra kick would that give us before going to, say, QE4 or some other tool", " WILLIAMS.  It\u2019s clear, but it\u2019s not satisfactory, really, because if you think about it\u2014and I have talked about this so many times\u2014these kinds of arbitrary \u201cI am pushing the funds rate in one, and I am putting inertia in the other,\u201d and you are getting what are nonsensical responses that one path is above the other, even though the economy is worse.  I would prefer to see something like an optimal control exercise, in which you are really doing something that is apples-to-apples, so that I could see what the different outcomes would be if I was trying to do something that is consistent with our views", " MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to follow up with President Williams on the same exhibit 4, \u201cA Recession at the Zero Lower Bound.\u201d I agree with President Williams, to do this experiment in which we lower the funds rate to implausible levels and then trace out the response\u2014I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the most useful thing to show to the Committee.  I\u2019ll suggest an alternative experiment, which is:  You do have this constant probability of recession.  If a recession occurred in 2016, I think what the Committee wants to know is, how much QE  would you have to do to mitigate the recession and what does the staff model say about that. And then, as an alternative, you assume the recession does not occur until 2019 or something like that, when the funds rate is much higher or in a much better position, and then presumably you might not have to do any QE, or might have to do much less or something like that.  But otherwise we\u2019re comparing to something that, you know, we can\u2019t do.  So that\u2019s kind of distressing. On exhibit 7, which is entitled \u201cLiftoff\u201d and is about the dollar, figure 2, \u201cDollar Moves Around the Start of a Tightening Cycle,\u201d shows the average of past tightening cycles, and the black line declines\u2014which I guess is a depreciation of the dollar in the months following these four previous historic tightening cycles.  So I thought you were going to show me an alternative scenario of \u201cwhat if that happened.\u201d  And that isn\u2019t actually the alternative that you showed me in figures 3, 4, and 5 here.  You showed me further tightening", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019m heartened by the continued progress on getting Americans back to work and by the prospect that there\u2019s room to pull more prime-age workers back into the labor force.  By contrast, I\u2019m uneasy about the inflation leg of our mandate, and it would be difficult for me to point to any developments in the intermeeting period that have raised my confidence that core inflation will move to our 2 percent target in the next two to three years.For six years now, PCE inflation has averaged below 1.5 percent.  As this is despite substantial monetary accommodation and a substantial gain in resource utilization, it really does suggest that the Phillips curve is inert.  In addition, I\u2019m troubled by hints that the persistent underperformance of inflation may be having some effect on inflation expectations.  Although previously, survey data had remained fairly steady, recent readings of both the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Michigan survey\u2014and, of course, as Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveys\u2014have drifted lower.  This follows a pronounced and persistent deterioration in market-based measures. Moreover, while the risks to domestic activity look relatively balanced, I am wary regarding the fact that that foreign developments could continue to pose downside risks to economic activity and financial conditions.  China is in the midst of navigating a complex of difficult cyclical and structural challenges.  Recent further sharp declines in oil and metals prices underscore ongoing risks to a broader set of emerging markets, which are confronting challenges of their own that could be exacerbated by further terms-of-trade deterioration, weak growth prospects, and difficulties associated with elevated debt burdens.  It would be unwise to dismiss lightly the risk of further bouts of currency volatility or pressure on these economies. I\u2019m also mindful of the fact that there are important risks on the other side\u2014in particular, the risk that inflationary pressures may emerge with greater force than is expected today.  As I take into account the risks on both sides, the combination of asymmetrically greater room to tighten than to ease through conventional means; core inflation stubbornly below its target, with the deterioration we\u2019ve seen in inflation expectations; and downside risks arising from abroad leads me to place somewhat greater weight on the possible regret associated with tightening tooearly than on the possible regret associated with waiting a little longer to see some of these risks play out before moving. I respect, of course, that many other members of the Committee, after lengthy deliberations, have come to a different conclusion.  In that context, those same risk-management considerations argue for great care in what we communicate about the path forward.  Let me highlight three specific aspects.  First, in light of the persistent low readings on inflation, the deterioration in measures of inflation expectations, and the fact that we will be lifting off when actual inflation remains well short of our goal, it\u2019s very important to me to emphasize that future monetary policy will be importantly shaped by the credibility of our commitment to move inflation back to our target.  In our discussion of the likely future path of monetary policy in paragraph 4, I put a lot of weight on the language that calls out inflation developments and progress toward our 2 percent goal as importantly influencing the stance of future policy. Second, the combination of a low neutral rate with slow progress on inflation suggests a greater likelihood of hitting the effective lower bound than in previous decades, when the nominal neutral interest rate was probably much higher.  The lower the longer-term nominal neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to push growth sufficiently below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate well below zero to provide accommodation.  As a result, monetary policy is likely to remain more constrained at the effective lower bound than to be operating at interest rate levels above it.  As the probability of hitting the effective lower bound increases, that asymmetry in our flexibility becomes more pronounced. For this reason, it\u2019s very helpful that the statement provides additional guidance reflecting the Committee\u2019s consideration of our reinvestment policy.  The language in the fifthparagraph clarifying that the Committee anticipates continuing reinvestments \u201cuntil normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way\u201d helps clarify that future changes in monetary policy initially will rely primarily on the funds rate\u2014our best-understood and most tested policy tool\u2014and will provide more room to respond to negative shocks through conventional monetary tools. Finally, it\u2019s very important to communicate that, based on our understanding of the neutral rate, the path is likely to be more gradual and move to a lower level than has been the case in past tightening cycles.  Recent research by the staff and others has shown that the current neutral rate is extremely low by historical standards and has persisted at a very low level for some time. Furthermore, persistent changes in demographics, productivity growth, risk premiums, and foreign growth suggest that it may remain at a low level well into the future.  As these circumstances are highly unusual, it\u2019s necessary to communicate to the public the effects they will have on monetary policy\u2014namely, that normalization of the policy rate will likely be more gradual than in previous tightening episodes and likely move to a longer-run policy rate below historical norms.  Moreover, the \u201cgradual and low path\u201d message should help reduce the risk of a \u201ctightening tantrum\u201d reaction to liftoff\u2014a reaction that could slow progress toward both of our goals.  For all of these reasons, I place a lot of weight on the message that the pace of normalization is likely to be gradual, albeit data dependent. Let me conclude by saying I appreciate the careful and exhaustive preparations that have been undertaken by the staff, as well as the thoughtful approach of the Chair and the Committee over the past many months to ensure liftoff is operationally well managed and to align public expectations with the Committee\u2019s policy reaction function and outlook. At this critical juncture, I place a very high premium on ensuring the credibility of monetary policy and demonstrating effective control over monetary policy right out of the box.  For that reason, I support the Chair\u2019s preferred approach as laid out in alternative B.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard", " MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In line with my economic forecast, my position on policy remains that we should raise rates at this meeting, and that the path of future funds rate increases should be gradual and data dependent, to use President Lacker\u2019s language. Given my inflation forecast, I anticipate that this will lead to a rather gradual tightening of policy, and that policy will remain accommodative for some time.  I adopt this position based on the fact that inflation has remained persistently below target and I thus attach some uncertainty to our ability to achieve our inflation target over the medium term.   Placing some weight on these risks implies a policy rate path that is somewhat more accommodative than would be implied by historical behavior.  In particular, I envision at most four rate hikes next year, leaving the funds rate at, say, 1.38 percent at the end of 2016, with subsequent increases to 2.63 percent in 2017 and to 3.5 percent at the end of 2018, which is my view of the long-run neutral funds rate.  However, I should stress that my perspective will be continually updated by the data.  Therefore, I support alternative B, which I believe is in accordance with these views. I would suggest one small change in the language, and that is to delete the clause \u201cand recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes\u201d in paragraph 3.  Now, I understand the logic behind the addition of this phrase, but it seems innocuous at best and may just add confusion.  This may be idiosyncratic to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, but, in a discussion of what the wording could possibly mean, there were as many views among the people who were in the Philadelphia Reserve Bank staff\u2019s briefings to me as there are among FOMC participants.  The views ranged from signaling to the markets that the current move should not be interpreted as having any immediate economic effect to indicating that the current move was being made to prevent the Committee from \u201cfalling behind the policy curve.\u201d  I think we should, therefore, admit that this language, at least to us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, is unclear, and I believe we should avoid adding uncertainty to our current policy decision.  While I understand that a change in the language of alternative B at this time is highly unlikely, it is wording I would not want to see carried from statement to statement.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MR. LYON.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In October, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate if two conditions were met:  First, we saw some further improvement in the labor market, and, second, the Committee was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  In the previous go-round, I noted that the labor market has improved since October, butindications of future inflation have changed very little.  Alternatives B and C would raise the federal funds rate target, but neither offers as complete a rationale for this decision as I would have preferred. As I discussed in the previous go-round, our best statistical forecasting models, as well as market- and survey-based forecasts, suggest that inflation is likely to remain below target over the medium term.  To maintain its credibility, the FOMC must ensure that the public fully understands how monetary policy decisions relate to the Committee\u2019s stated objectives and plans.  In turn, credibility is crucial for keeping inflation expectations well anchored.  I therefore believe it would be useful to offer a more complete and explicit rationale for raising rates at a time when the modal outlook still calls for very tame inflation.  Such an explanation could build on concerns that if we delay raising rates, we face the risk of having to eventually tighten rapidly and disruptively in the event of a rapid increase in inflation. If this concern or other risk factors broadly reflect the Committee members\u2019 thinking on why a rate increase is appropriate at this time, then I would encourage the Committee to take every opportunity to explain these concerns in its communications.  Thoroughly explaining the key factors in the decision will help build public understanding of the Committee\u2019s reaction function and ensure that we maintain the credibility of our 2 percent inflation target. I believe that effective communication will become even more important as normalization proceeds. The SEP suggests that the Committee is likely to raise rates by about 100 basis points in the first year\u2014in other words, at only about half of the meetings.  I\u2019m concerned that such a pace may prove particularly challenging to communicate.  The Committee will need to explain why it\u2019s adjusting the funds rate target at some meetings but not others, without tying policy too tightly to volatile incoming data but also without committing to a fixed path of increases that cannot react to data at all.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester", " MR. FISCHER.  May I enter a divided vote. I would not like the word \u201cunanimously\u201d to appear in the fourth line of the implementation note.  There is, in the fourth line\u2014 CHAIR YELLEN.  We haven\u2019t voted on that yet", " MR. FISCHER.  Oh, I thought I heard you saying there was. CHAIR YELLEN.  We\u2019re going to have some further votes, and we\u2019ll see if they\u2019re unanimous or not", " MR. FISCHER.  I\u2019m sorry to return to this point, but, in the \u201cDecisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation,\u201d the word \u201cunanimously\u201d appears twice in square brackets.  Since the extent of the majority by which this decision is being made by the Board is of no consequence whatever to how we do the monetary policy implementation, I don\u2019t know why we need the word \u201cunanimously.\u201d CHAIR YELLEN.  No, we do because these are Board votes, and we\u2019re reporting Board votes.  If they\u2019re not unanimous, anyone who dissented would be listed explicitly as a dissenter, potentially with some short statement as to what the dissent was.  So we\u2019re formally recording here, in the implementation note, votes of the Board of Governors", "  If we need to change the interest rate on excess reserves today to make our policy work, yes, that\u2014 MR. EVANS.  Right.  But as soon as somebody opines in a policy way, that\u2019s not according to the rules.  That\u2019s the way I remember the FOMC briefings in the past, during the crisis. CHAIR YELLEN.  That\u2019s right.  We\u2019ve had these briefings before"]}
