{"2017FOMC20170201meeting.txt": [" VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. It\u2019s sort of ambiguous", "  A lot of people are expecting us to do it once\u2014 MR. POTTER. It\u2019s been between about 1 and 1\u00bd percent for over 12 months.  And when we first asked this after the rate increase and the change of language in the postmeeting statement, which is the \u201cflash\u201d survey after the December 2015 meeting, they thought 12 months ahead, because they were thinking, \u201cWell, the federal funds rate could likely have been in that range.\u201d  And then, as the market path flattened and the SEP changed, you could see some extension for months out under most of them.  The dealers are more likely to have it be state contingent than some of the people on the buy side, but there is a general movement in that direction.  There is uncertainty about what \u201cwell under way\u201d means", "\u201d So our discussion of it may have pulled some people forward\u2014 MS. LOGAN.  That\u2019s where I said 17 of the participants did change the level of the rate at which they thought the reinvestments were going to be changed", " MR. KAPLAN.  And that won\u2019t be offset, in your judgment, by the appreciation of the dollar", " MR. KAPLAN.  But not completely", " MR. KAMIN.  Exactly.  If it did increase fully to offset the border adjustment tax, and if there weren\u2019t some other rigidities that happen to be built into our system\u2014it takes time for trade to adjust, there is some time involved in producers changing prices, and so on.  If those rigidities were not present, and if the dollar went the full amount, then you would get no change in the macroeconomic variables.  And that was the argument that was made by various economists in blogs and newspaper articles and whatnot", " MR. KAMIN. There are some factors like that.  In our model, as I have discussed with our modelers, some of those factors aren\u2019t built in.  But let me pick up on Simon\u2019s point.  In rarified models in which the dollar immediately jumps the full amount of the border adjustment tax so there are no changes in any macro variables, that change in the dollar by itself introducesJanuary 31\u2013very substantial wealth effects and very substantial balance sheet effects that indeed might be expected to affect economic activity. Now, those particular financial effects are not actually built into our general equilibrium model anyway.  I suppose they could be.  That would require some fairly advanced modeling of the kind that we are developing, and that would be another reason why you wouldn\u2019t get the instant jump to what\u2019s basically a steady state with an unchanged macroeconomy.  In our case, we generate that through other rigidities, but it is also true that changes in the dollar alone can generate financial effects that would, again, prevent adjustment immediately in the way that some fiscal economists have suggested", "  But not through tariffs and\u2014 MR. KAMIN. Exactly.  But they do not retaliate via tariffs or taxes. If they did, that could, indeed, significantly diminish the short-run benefits of these measures to the United States.  It is worth getting a little bit more specific. Let\u2019s put it this way, if we impose a tariff and they impose a retaliatory tariff, that is very clearly a negative for us.  And that takes our tariff hike, which has some short-run positive effects on real GDP, and immediately makes it negative. We haven\u2019t done this, but I think things get a little bit more complicated if you think about whether, in response to our border adjustment tax, they actually retaliate with their border January 31\u2013adjustment tax.  The reason I say it\u2019s a little bit more complicated is because the border adjustment taxes actually involve subsidies as well as tariffs", "  And so a subsidy war actually could have the implication of global fiscal expansion, which\u2014 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But, Steve, don\u2019t they already have something pretty equivalent in a lot of countries", " MR. KAMIN.  Well, the number I\u2019ve heard for how long the litigation would take is five years", " MR. ROSENGREN. My question is for Andreas.  It\u2019s in exhibit 1, \u201cSpread of Capitalization Rate at Origination to Treasury Yield.\u201d I\u2019m just wondering whether that is the most relevant comparison, because when I think about cap rates for commercial real estate, they are very slow moving.  And when I think of how Treasury yields have moved, they tend to move very quickly.  If you look at December, it looks like a 1 percent decline in that measure.  But I think that\u2019s because Treasury yields went up, not because there was a big movement in commercial real estate prices.  And, in fact, much of this movement seems to be driven by Treasury yields rather than commercial real estate valuations.  So I just wonder whether you think this is the most useful way to determine valuation in the commercial real estate market", " MR. WILCOX.  Well, to paraphrase the line from the movie, I\u2019m not sure who this \u201cwe\u201d is, Kemosabe.  [Laughter]  We provide you with these confidence intervals that are shown in the Tealbook, but for purposes of putting together the kinds of exhibits that I show regularly, my own preference here is to continue using FRB/US-model-generated confidence intervals. We do cross-check them against one another to make sure that the model\u2019s confidence intervals don\u2019t stray in their characteristics too awfully far from the others.  I was going to call on either Dave or Jeremy Rudd.  In general, my impression is that the FRB/US model\u2019s confidence intervals are a little narrower than the actual judgmental track record has been", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  Since the election, there\u2019s been this major move in equity values, and it\u2019s about 8 or 9 percent, so I was really eager to get my financial stability memo, because that\u2019s where I was figuring I could count on an assessment of this thing that gets debated in the press, which is the extent to which this represents a warranted revision of the fundamentals underlying dividend growth or not.  And I was a little disappointed by the extent of your discussion of that question.  I was happy there was an interesting box in the Tealbook about dividend growth projections.  That seemed informative.  But I was yearning to hear you tell us [laughter] whether equity moves have outstripped the move in fundamentals. January 31\u2013Now, there was something in there about historical percentiles, and that got me thinking, well, maybe when you say valuation pressures, I should just take that as a statistical term about historical things even though things change in the future.  And maybe the valuation change is warranted even though it\u2019s out in the tail of historical distribution.  Could you help me with this, Andreas", "  January 31\u2013MR. KAPLAN.  I hate to get into this discussion, but I\u2019ll just make one comment, which maybe hasn\u2019t been talked about enough.  The mean estimates of the value, right or wrong, of a corporate tax reduction, even to 25 percent, are about $9 per share, annualized.  So if you take $126 and take that to $135, you could also argue it may be more than just animal spirits.  Some of that increase from a corporate tax reduction is being reflected in the market\u2014who knows how much, but it\u2019s probably a good bet that some of it is", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Our surveys, and reports received from business contacts, indicated that economic activity in the Fifth District continued to strengthen since the previous FOMC meeting.  The manufacturing survey improved for the third consecutive month and indicated solid activity in January, led by increases in shipments and new orders.  Service-sector activity also continued to expand more broadly since the December meeting.  Expectations regarding activity over the next six months improved in both surveys as well. The overall tone from contacts continued to be quite positive, although there was some uncertainty expressed regarding potential changes in fiscal and trade policy.  A number of contacts reported increased business investment or plans to increase investment in 2017.  One of our directors whose firm fabricates and installs structural steel for large commercial buildings indicated that he was very bullish about the economy, and his company was purchasing equipment and planning a new facility.  A leading manufacturer of gypsum board, cement boards, and finishing products reported a jump in capital expenditures for 2017.  Contacts in the auto and industrial supply sector reported strong investment as well. Comments from our service-sector contacts were positive, on balance, as well.  An engineering firm reported strong demand and so much difficulty finding workers that they were declining projects.  A banker noted that consumer and commercial demand had been healthy and that business was \u201ccurrently as good as it gets.\u201d He also said that he had heard strong optimism from customers, who indicated that they were investing in real estate and infrastructure for their companies. A staffing agency specializing in accounting, finance, and human resources reported January 31\u2013a very strong December and January due to tight labor market conditions and noted that firms were using fewer temporary workers and instead were looking more for direct hires. She further noted that this was making it difficult for staffing agencies to maintain a deep temporary labor pool. Not all of our contacts were positive, however.  A dealer in heavy construction equipment noted that customer doubts about their pipeline were causing them to lease equipment rather than buy. Several contacts in the transportation industry noted that conditions were improving but remained weak.  A number of contacts relayed concerns regarding upcoming federal policy changes, including the potential repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act as well as trade and fiscal policy. A defense industry executive noted that there was tremendous uncertainty in their sector, citing the federal hiring freeze and the lengthy confirmation process for agency leadership.  In addition, she noted that potential shifts in U.S. diplomatic posture in some regions could cause foreign governments to reevaluate strategic alignments and shift their defense acquisition strategies toward non-U.S. suppliers. Turning to the national economy: I agree with the staff\u2019s assessment that the usual statistical reports provide little reason to alter the outlook.  U.S. households have benefitted from robust employment growth and are expecting further improvements in labor market conditions. Thus, consumer spending was strong in the fourth quarter and is likely to be solid in the current quarter and beyond, even in the absence of tax cuts.  Rising employment, rising incomes, and rising consumer sentiment should all support continued growth in consumer spending. The residential outlook for this year is more opaque.  It is possible that rising household formation will boost the demand for new homes and support growth in residential investment,January 31\u2013but it\u2019s not clear that supply constraints on new home construction are easing, and their continuation would be a headwind for residential investments. And a firmer rate environment could damp demand this year, as the Tealbook suggests. The Tealbook forecast includes strong growth in non-residential fixed investment this year, and I agree with that outlook based in part on incoming data, such as the increase in oil drilling and the firming of new orders for capital goods.  But I also put some weight on the improvement in business sentiment since the election.  In addition to the anecdotes, such as those I cited earlier, there\u2019s a notable jump in small business optimism that was reported by the NFIB, and the Conference Board\u2019s measures of CEO sentiment have risen notably in the fourth quarter as well. In short, the consideration of the usual spending measures supports a forecast of overall growth continuing at an above-trend rate, which should lead to additional tightening in labor markets. In the near term, I would expect employment growth to average near last quarter\u2019s pace of 165,000 jobs per month.  That\u2019s below the Tealbook\u2019s first-half estimate of 183,000 jobs per month.  Even so, my forecast is more than double the benchmark for breakeven employment growth, so I expect a continued decline in the unemployment rate or an increase in the labor force participation rate or both. The significant rise in inflation breakevens since the election has been noteworthy, I think.  The 10-year breakeven is now 10 basis points higher than it was in October 2014, the first meeting at which our statement mentioned that inflation expectations had declined.  This supports the case that inflation will rise toward 2 percent even if it is held down temporarily by base effects in the near term.   January 31\u2013I continue to anticipate the need for policy rates to rise briskly this year, and we may need to move at non-press-conference meetings, in my view.  In any case, I fervently hope we\u2019ll increase rates a few times before I retire", " MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, overall economic activity in the Third District continued to improve, with activity in the Philadelphia metro area picking up notably.  Employment growth also improved somewhat in December, and there is evidence of increasing price pressures as well. The overall outlook was a bit more positive than it has been in a while.  Our January manufacturing survey displayed its strongest readings since November 2014, with strength in shipments, new orders, employment, and inventories.  There is ample evidence that manufacturers are beginning to restock, and optimism is rampant. One well-diversified contact in the region indicated that his order book to May is up an astonishing 50 percent from a year ago, and he is seeing strength in Asia and Europe despite the strong dollar.  He is not seeing red in any of his business lines.  His organic pet foods business is booming, and the margins are incredible.  It is a good time to be a dog in America.  [Laughter] Activity in our service sector is picking up as well after several months of rather tepid growth.  Revenues and new orders were robust in January, and strength was widespread.  Additionally, auto sales have been robust, and future indexes remain unusually high for this late in an expansion. Employment reports in the region are a bit mixed, with employment growth fairly flat, which doesn\u2019t quite square with the falling unemployment rate, low initial claims, and the information we are receiving from our surveys.  Nonresidential construction activity in the region is also robust, and even with the substantial addition of office space\u20145 percent more square footage is being added over the next few years\u2014it is being occupied at an even faster pace and leading to an acceleration in net absorption and rents.  On the residential side, our   January 31\u2013region continues to look much different than the nation, with the multifamily sector performing relatively better than the nation and the single-family performing relatively worse.  In Philadelphia, homeownership rates are still falling as millennials continue to move in and become an increasing share of the population.  Rents are rising, and vacancy rates continue to fall sharply.  We are also hearing anecdotal evidence of supply constraints in the housing sector. One notable change in our landscape is that manufacturers are reporting a steep increase in prices received.  That series has jumped to its highest level in the recovery, and it currently stands at 20 points above average, which loosely translates to an equivalent 2\u00bd percent monthly rise in the PPI at an annualized rate. Regarding the nation as a whole, my economic outlook is a touch stronger than the staff\u2019s and falls more in line with the private forecast displayed in the Tealbook.  I think we could see growth over the next two years of 2 percent or perhaps a bit higher, and I anticipate inflation returning to target perhaps by the end of this year.  Nominal wage growth has accelerated, and I think aggregation is masking a bit of the underlying strength in wages.  I think price pressures are a bit more robust than is reflected in the staff\u2019s forecast, and we may need to be sensitive to this in our policy deliberations tomorrow and beyond.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester", " MS. GOODING.  Soundings from Sixth District directors and business contacts continue to be optimistic.  However, the optimism has waned somewhat since last cycle. Their focus has shifted to the uncertainty surrounding potential changes to fiscal, regulatory, and trade policies.  We\u2019ve frequently heard that firms are holding off on making any significant changes to their business plans and are shelving capital investments projects until the details of these potential initiatives become clear. In general, however, our contacts have also noted little change in near-term business activity.  Most contacts confirmed ongoing tightening in labor markets.  In response to some difficulty finding workers, and in an effort to expand their set of work-ready candidates, many firms are partnering with area workforce development organizations or academic institutions to create custom training programs. Although many firms saw little in the way of pricing power, an increasing number of firms were confident that they would be able to pass through recent commodity price increases to customers. On nominal wage growth, District firms continue to report increases in the 2 to 3 percent range. Consistent with the incoming economic data, our forecast is largely unchanged.  We see GDP growth continuing at roughly 2 percent over the medium term and inflation returning to our objective.  Like our directors and business contacts, we see the risk to our outlook mostly associated with changes to fiscal, trade, and regulatory policy.  We have yet to mark in any fiscal January 31\u2013stimulus over the forecast horizon, and we are waiting for the details to become more apparent. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In light of my outlook and the progress on our dual-mandate goals, I view an upward path of the federal funds rate as appropriate.  The question is when to take the next step on that path.  If we had prepared the public for it, I would be advocating taking another step today.  However, since we did not do that, I can live with alternative B. I\u2019d be more comfortable if we were at a higher level of the funds rate.  As I mentioned yesterday, I recognize there\u2019s considerable uncertainty about the outlook, but I don\u2019t think the proper reaction to that uncertainty is to stand pat and do nothing.  Rather, I think we should be prepared to set policy consistent with our outlook.  If and when some of the uncertainty is resolved or some risks are realized that change our outlook, then we should be prepared to change policy appropriately.  Under the circumstances, I suspect that over the next few years we may need to change our forecasts and our anticipated policy rate path more frequently than we have over the past couple of years.  I think that\u2019s fine.  We should not hold ourselves to a standard of having to be prescient.  January 31\u2013I think a higher level of the funds rate now would better position us to respond to changes in the outlook on either the upside or the downside.  If the outlook changes, we may have to reverse course, but if it is done systematically on the basis of the outlook and we articulate the rationale, then that\u2019s not a problem. I note that a higher federal funds rate would also give us more flexibility to end reinvestments while still being consistent with our earlier communications that the criteria for stopping reinvestments would be based on the level of the funds rate.  I look forward to that discussion about reinvestment policy in March. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re \u201cbehind the curve\u201d yet, and I realize that the policy rate path that we anticipate does not require us to raise the policy rate at each meeting.  But, as we discussed last time, soft landings are hard to come by.  They\u2019ve occurred only when monetary policy is preemptive and began to tighten before the unemployment rate fell below real-time estimates of the natural rate and when the shocks that caused the economy to slow were either small or beneficial. So it\u2019s important that we remain vigilant against falling \u201cbehind the curve.\u201d  Like the siren song, waiting for uncertainty to resolve before acting is always seductive.  But we have continued to make progress on our goals.  There\u2019s a growing list of policy rules that suggests the current stance of policy is too accommodative and increasingly so.  The Board staff\u2019s assessment of asset valuation pressures has risen from moderate to notable, and leverage is very high for speculative-grade corporate borrowers.  In this environment, if we accumulate enough delays, we could easily find ourselves \u201cbehind the curve.\u201d I hope we avoid that shipwreck.  And if between now and March the data come in consistent with the forecast, I hope we will be open to moving the funds rate up. January 31\u2013Regarding the statement language, I prefer paragraph 4 in alternative C to that in alternative B. In view of the progress to date, and anticipated further progress, on the inflation goal, I no longer think it necessary to continue to point out the shortfall of inflation from the goal or to emphasize we\u2019re carefully monitoring progress, which, of course, we always are.  However, I understand that today may not be the day to make such a change.  It may be better to wait until we move the funds rate again. I continue to think we should find a way to back away from or clarify the \u201cgradual path\u201d language in paragraph 4.  If we look at the median path in the December SEP, we see a path that has the funds rate rising gradually toward and staying below its longer-run level.  That may be how the public is interpreting \u201cgradual.\u201d  However, in many individual forecasts, including the Tealbook, the funds rate moves above the long-run level before coming back down and converging to it.  Indeed, the Tealbook baseline has the funds rate moving up to 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, 1 full percentage point above the longer-run level. The pattern is also seen in all of the alternative simulations.  So even ignoring the uncertainty regarding the policy rate path, I don\u2019t think the public understands that the anticipated path includes an overshoot. In addition, there are a number of risks that, if realized, may entail a different policy rate path from that we currently anticipate.  As I mentioned, I think we need to be prepared for more changes to the outlook and appropriate policy rate path than we\u2019ve seen in recent years.  This will be a communications challenge.  I think we\u2019d be well served to eliminate the \u201cgradual\u201d language when we next change the funds rate or even sooner. Conveying the degree of uncertainty regarding our current assessment of the likely future policy rate path, in view of the uncertainty associated with the forecast and the inevitable shocks January 31\u2013that will hit the economy, will also be helpful, and I\u2019m glad that we will be publishing confidence bands around the SEP numbers, starting in March.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for today.  I would describe this meeting as the dog that didn\u2019t bark.  This statement is not setting up a March meeting move, and I think that\u2019s probably the most significant thing that\u2019s happening here that will be noted today and as this spills out through financial markets in the coming days. In my view, if we\u2019re not willing to set up a March move or hint toward it at this meeting, then I would not try to do it during the intermeeting period unless we got data that were significantly different than what we were otherwise expecting, on the order of a standard deviation different from what we had previously thought.  Markets right now are putting the highest probability on a June move\u2014perhaps one or two hikes this year, as Thomas\u2019s presentation just showed us in panels 1 and 2, with a lot of diffusion associated with that expectation. After this meeting, we will all be asked whether March is on the table, with \u201con the table\u201d becoming the most common thing that\u2019s used to describe whether we might possibly move at a  January 31\u2013meeting or not.  We will all, of course, have to answer that it is because all meetings are live, and what that may do is set off a wave of speculation about a March FOMC move.  That\u2019s been a pattern that has developed\u2014unfortunately, I think\u2014repeatedly in the 2015 and 2016 time frame, and I don\u2019t see any reason for it not to continue now. My own view is that fiscal uncertainty is unlikely to be meaningfully resolved by the March meeting.  In past political situations like the current one, key legislation was not signed until August.  In addition, details in a fiscal package do matter considerably for the future path of the economy.  And while I do think that some of the Administration\u2019s policies have the potential to increase medium-term growth, there are also downside risks\u2014especially through the trade channel should it trigger reactions from foreign economies on trade aspects of the global macroeconomy. The current strategy of the Committee has us putting upward pressure on the short end of the yield curve through changes in the policy rate in the quarters ahead but also simultaneously maintaining downward pressure on the longer end of the yield curve, at least according to our rhetoric, by maintaining a large balance sheet.  This sounds like our policy is to flatten the yield curve.  I\u2019m not sure that it really is, and I\u2019m not sure that it makes that much sense.  I think it\u2019s time to carefully reconsider the Committee\u2019s reinvestment policy. If we end reinvestment with only moderate policy rate changes\u2014and we have only one rate change for 2017 in our assumptions in St. Louis\u2014we would be normalizing the yield curve, albeit at a very low level.  But that low level is consistent with today\u2019s regime of global low interest rates, low inflation, and low growth.  The staff analysis doesn\u2019t acknowledge that there are multiple regimes and so always has us returning to a relatively high interest rate, higher-growth regime in the future, which I think is not the way to look at the data.  January 31\u2013I think ending the reinvestment with only one policy rate change would be a more appropriate policy move in 2017 than to try to have a significant rise in the policy rate and keep the reinvestment policy as it is.  I look forward to the discussion of this issue at our next meeting in March.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Consistent with the Committee\u2019s ongoing guidance that rates will increase only gradually, I view today\u2019s decision as appropriate.  I also see the wisdom of making minimal adjustments to the statement, although I would have preferred alternative C\u2019s characterization of inflation.  Paragraph 4 of alternative B continues to emphasize the current shortfall of inflation from the 2 percent goal, language that was added in December 2015 when headline inflation was around \u00bd percent. With significant uncertainties about the scope, size, and timing of potential changes in fiscal policies, calibrating monetary policy will be more challenging.  I continue to support a gradual approach in removing accommodation but one that is considerably faster than one rate increase annually, especially if the labor market continues to strengthen. Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari"], "2017FOMC20170315meeting.txt": [" MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question on the reinvestment box\u2014and this actually gets to the Vice Chairman\u2019s first question\u2014where the alternative is to \u201cinvest all maturing funds into shorter maturities, perhaps bills.\u201d If the alternative strategy was to let the U.S. Treasury only issue Treasury bills instead of us holding the Treasury bills, would there be any difference in the interest rate effect of that.  So just let it roll off, and if the Treasury decides to issue bills rather than at longer maturities, is there an interest rate effect.  And that gets to a second part to the question, which is the Treasury\u2019s debt management policy.  Under each of these policies, the Treasury debt management team is making choices on maturity, on issuance, on timing.  Have we discussed with the Treasury how any of these options would alter their own strategies on debt management. So rather than us trying to manipulate the Treasury securities held by the public, has the Treasury been brought into this discussion.  And have they raised any concerns", " MS. IHRIG.  I just wanted to note that there was a Board briefing in May of last year by Erin Ferris in which she looked at how the Treasury would respond to the Federal Reserve\u2019s redemption policy, and depending if they issued, say, bills only or only long-term bonds, our model suggests there could be an effect", " MR. POTTER.  But if they act in an independent way from us, then we don\u2019t control their decisions.  And currently there is interest in extending the maturity of Treasury debt", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think the 1\u00bd percent trigger is an appropriate conceptual place to start, subject to continued progress in meeting our dual-mandate objectives.  I think this trigger and our actions should be state dependent, and I do think our actions should be reversible, although I would prefer not to state precisely under what conditions we would reverse our tapering. The reasons I\u2019d like to see us get started sooner rather than later are political economy reasons, in large part in that I do believe that in the future we\u2019re going to need to use our balance sheet, and I think if we keep too large a balance sheet, we risk not being able to use it in the future when we most need it.  So, again, I would get started sooner rather than later. I would argue that when we do start, it should be done gradually, and in terms of the options of either a one- to two-year phaseout or a capping of securities or some combination thereof, I\u2019ll defer to the Open Market Desk, but, for me, slower is likely to mean we\u2019ll run off this balance sheet faster.  I think the period of greatest risk will be at the start, and I think once we get launched and rolling, we have a much greater likelihood that this will be a sustainable policy. It will also give us the greatest probability by going slower at the start of shoving off and making sure we\u2019ve got market stability and we minimize the effect on the markets. In terms of when we announce this, my own view would be, conceptually, either at the meeting at which we raise the federal funds rate target range to 125 to 150 basis points or at the meeting after that meeting.  I would recommend we make an announcement and we begin one to two months later.  I actually would be in favor of shortening the time frame between when we announce this and when we implement it, because I think fear of the unknown may actually be the biggest factor in the market reaction. I think at that point when we make the announcement, we should write a public implementation memo or an amendment to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and lay it out then.  And, for me, in terms of today, the main thing I\u2019d want communicated in our minutes discussion is that we reaffirm the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and that we  had a discussion.  But I would want to wait until a future meeting to give a detailed articulation of what we plan to do and then start again one to two months later and not leave too much time between announcing and starting.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Assuming the federal funds rate continues to rise toward its expected longer-run level on the SEP median path, we should be prepared to issue a revised statement of principles and plans for balance sheet normalization by the second or third quarter of this year. I would expect a revised statement to outline, in broad strokes, the conditions under which the balance sheet would start to be released, the relative roles of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet and their relationship in achieving the Committee\u2019s objectives once that process begins, the process for allowing the balance sheet to run off, the framework that will govern the size of the balance sheet when it reaches the \u201cnew normal,\u201d and any conditions that might warrant alteration of that path.  Let me take each in turn. First, the Committee should continue to follow a state-contingent and, more specifically, a rate-contingent policy in determining when full balance sheet reinvestment should be discontinued.  Although the staff simulations using the FRB/US model suggest little economic difference between state- and date-contingent approaches, the Committee\u2019s judgment must also take into account the more complicated reality of the markets as well as any unexpected shocks. A policy that\u2019s contingent on the level of the federal funds rate would enable the Committee to clearly communicate its intentions while retaining control over the timing in the event of changes in economic conditions or adverse shocks.   In contrast, a time-contingent strategy risks either time inconsistency or relinquishing that control in the face of adverse shocks.  For instance, a time-contingent policy of discontinuing reinvestment in the third or fourth quarter of this year could coincide with a time of unusual stress in the Treasury security markets in the event that uncertainty over the debt ceiling has not been resolved by then, as happened in the previous two episodes. By contrast, a policy that\u2019s tied to the federal funds rate would clearly signal the intention to proceed if economic circumstances warrant while retaining the flexibility to adjust to adverse developments through adjusting the path of the federal funds rate.  Indeed, the policy adopted in December 2015 to rely solely on the federal funds rate to remove accommodation until normalization is well under way has demonstrated the value of this approach.  It has ensured that our most familiar and tested tool, the funds rate, will have reached a level at which it can be cut meaningfully to counter adverse shocks and thus help to guard against asymmetric risks associated with the effective lower bound. With regard to the SEP median, placing the long-run value of the federal funds rate around 3 percent, it would be reasonable to define normalization as well under way once the range for the federal funds rate has reached midway to its long-run equilibrium value, which suggests passing a threshold of around 1\u00bd percent.  A threshold below this level leaves too little room to cut the funds rate if needed, while a threshold significantly above it risks delaying for too long balance sheet normalization.  Current SEP numbers suggest this threshold could be reached as soon as the third quarter of this year, such that full reinvestment could be discontinued in the fourth quarter if economic conditions continue to evolve in line with the median projection.   Once full reinvestment is discontinued, the FOMC effectively will have two tools to remove accommodation, which is a change from previous tightening cycles.  The revised policy statement should clarify whether the Committee will employ a strategy of complementarity in which the federal funds rate target and balance sheet are both used actively, as some have suggested, or a strategy of subordination, which would prioritize the federal funds rate as the sole active tool away from the effective lower bound. In this approach, once the federal funds rate rises sufficiently, the balance sheet would be set on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until a \u201cnew normal\u201d has been reached, and then increasing in line with trend increases in the demand for currency.  Indeed, I would argue that predictability, parsimony, precision, and clarity of communications all argue in favor of focusing policy on the federal funds rate as the single active tool in circumstances in which the two tools are largely substitutes. Third, I favor a gradual and predictable phaseout of reinvestments, at least over the first two years when principal repayments are elevated.  While the background memo suggests there would be little difference in the economic effects of gradually phasing out versus immediately ceasing reinvestment, we cannot rule out that there may be material differences in how markets will react.  A phaseout should reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction because it would only gradually increase the amount of securities the market will be required to absorb.  It also aligns with the Committee\u2019s desire to remove accommodation gradually and seems to risk a lower likelihood of misinterpretation by markets as a signal of impatience. As the smoothing effect of the initial phaseout would fade over time and then end, it might be prudent to develop additional guard rails for reducing any spikes in the amount of securities that need to be funded by the market each month, for instance, by a monthly cap.  Such an approach would further reduce the chances of adverse market reactions, and I\u2019d be open to this type of approach if the staff felt the possibility of such disruptions were material.  In addition, I\u2019d be inclined to apply the change in our reinvestment policy symmetrically to Treasury securities and MBS. Fourth, the revised principles will need to set expectations about the framework that will govern the size of the balance sheet once it reaches its \u201cnew normal.\u201d The Committee\u2019s deliberations in November suggest that there\u2019s substantial support for maintaining the current framework, especially in view of its greater relative simplicity. The minimum level of reserves to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy in a floor system depends on the structural demand for reserves and the variability of short-term changes in the demand and supply of reserves.  Because of changes since the crisis, it\u2019s difficult to know with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop while still maintaining effective interest rate control.  Staff analysis suggests that regulatory changes and a heightened sensitivity toward risk on the part of financial participants may have moved the post-crisis demand for reserves up to a level between $250 billion and $750 billion, and a buffer capable of absorbing short-term variability might be about $250 billion. As we can\u2019t be sure of the \u201cnew normal\u201d level of excess reserves, the Committee may want to indicate that it will monitor money markets for indications that any further reduction in the supply of reserves would put upward pressure on money market rates as the balance sheet gradually declines perhaps below some amount, such as $1 trillion. Finally, it could be helpful for the revised principles to indicate circumstances that would call for exceptions to this approach.  Most obviously, during the period when the balance sheet is running down, if the economy encounters large adverse shocks, it may be appropriate tocommence the reinvestment of principal payments again, in order to preserve conventional policy space.  Informing markets of our intentions in this regard ex ante could promote stability in financial markets and resilience in the economy. In conclusion, the normalization principles released in September 2014, together with the December 2015 statement language, provided important clarity that was appropriate for the economic conditions of the past few years.  If progress toward our goals continues as expected, it will soon be time to revise those principles to clarify when and how balance sheet reinvestment policy will change.  I look forward to further discussion in meetings ahead.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MR. KAMIN. Let\u2019s put it this way.  I don\u2019t think there is as much arbitrage implicit, or at least of a material sort, in the inflation rates, which are going to be pretty similar across all three. We have the United Kingdom having the highest real rate of interest, and, in principle, that should motivate capital flows into the United Kingdom that, in the near term, should boost their GDP growth, but over time that arbitrage should lead to equalization of productivity growth in different regions and to some equalization in growth", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Just for myself, I\u2019m skeptical that this will all be arbitraged even in the very long run because you have all sorts of different risk assessments; political regimes; home-country bias in terms of investing; and saving propensities that could bevery, very, very long-lived.  There might be some forces that will try to push it together, but I think there are also some forces that are keeping them apart", " MR. FISCHER.  What\u2019s happened to Mexico. Has it shaken off some of the effect of our election on it.  Or is it just steady with that avenue", " MR. KAMIN.  Well, right now, let\u2019s say its real outlook and its financial outlook are going in slightly different directions in the sense that following the election, there was a great deal of concern about Mexico\u2019s situation.  The peso depreciated very dramatically in an environment of real uncertainty, and their yields went up a whole lot.  Over time, as it seems like perhaps the most dire expectations of people about, among other things, U.S. government policy, are not coming to pass, the peso has been strengthening.  It\u2019s kind of returning.  It\u2019s still pretty depreciated relative to pre-election, and financial conditions are getting more under control.  That is on the financial side. On the real side, a big hike in administered gasoline prices, a big fall in consumer and business sentiment, a drop-off in foreign direct investment into the country, and strong interest rate hikes by the Bank of Mexico are leading to a situation in which we\u2019ve projected a pretty sharp slowdown in growth in the coming year", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My economic outlook is quite similar to that of the Tealbook, with an assumption of both four increases in the federal funds rate and a tapered reduction in our balance sheet to begin in the third quarter.  I expect the unemployment rate to be 4\u00bd percent and both total and core PCE inflation rates to be just under 2 percent by the end of this year.  I expect the economy will continue to grow at 2.3 percent in 2018, in part because of my assumption that stimulative fiscal policy will be enacted at the beginning of that year.  My assumption about the fiscal stimulus, like that of the Tealbook, is fairly conservative and results in growth next year being 50 basis points above potential.  As the stimulus could well turn out to be larger, I see upside risk to the growth forecast and the possibility that the unemployment rate will fall to unsustainably low levels. My baseline forecast already requires a somewhat faster pace of tightening than the Tealbook in 2018 in order to avoid the Tealbook\u2019s predicted outcome of an even larger overshoot of full employment. For 2017, private forecasters provide quite similar forecasts.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters has the unemployment rate at 4\u00bd percent at the end of this year and total PCE inflation at 2 percent.  Thus, private forecasters expect we will be at our target inflation rate but beyond full employment at the end of this year.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters then expects 2.4 percent growth in 2018, with payroll additions averaging more than 160,000 per month.  Such an outcome is associated with an unchanged unemployment rate, which would   require continued above-trend growth in labor force participation. While this could be interpreted as successful probing, the Survey of Professional Forecasters\u2019 optimistic outlook for demand and hiring implies a significant risk that we will greatly overshoot full employment. The policy rate path assumed in the Tealbook forecast is still associated with a noticeable overshoot of both its and my estimate of full employment.  Such an outcome could be appropriate from a policy standpoint if there is a need to raise inflation and inflation expectations to the 2 percent level.  However, unlike the Tealbook, I am not confident that inflation will be so well behaved if the unemployment rate is approaching 4 percent. An unemployment rate so far below full employment is likely to produce a number of signs of fundamental imbalance.  First, I would expect that labor constraints would become an increasing problem.  There are currently 16 states with unemployment rates at 4 percent or lower.  Four of those states are in New England.  While some of the reasons for those low unemployment rates derive from the older population in those states, it is still the case that businesses in the more rural states, such as New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, are complaining that they are shelving expansion plans because of the difficulty in hiring and increasingly discussing the need to move to cities such as Boston, which has a large pool of young, well-educated workers. A number of asset prices are also showing signs of froth, which is notable in an environment in which monetary policy is widely assumed to be on a tightening path.  Emerging market stock prices have increased rapidly.  This is a sector that one might expect would be adversely affected by higher U.S. rates and the possibility of an appreciated dollar.  In addition, high-yield corporate bond spreads to 10-year Treasury securities have come down significantly.  Several research studies have highlighted the fact that narrow credit spreads can reflect ebullient  financial markets.  Finally, stock P/E ratios have risen well above their five-year average, and capitalization rates for commercial real estate are quite low by historical standards. I recently met with a group of executives of large commercial real estate firms to discuss current conditions.  Rather than defend current valuations, they emphasized that reaching-for-yield behavior was reflected in the willingness of domestic and foreign investors to continue to view commercial real estate favorably despite the high current valuations. While they had concerns with overall evaluations, they felt that their sectors, mostly high-rise buildings in major markets, were underwritten more carefully and had been selected so well that they thought they would be reasonably insulated from a potential negative shock.  Despite their assurances, I am not particularly comforted by the cranes that are now beginning to cap some of the new high-rise buildings in the Seaport District of Boston, providing a risk of softening prices as the new supply hits the market. In summary, I am concerned that a forecast of very low unemployment rates has implications beyond just tight labor market conditions.  Other imbalances are likely to appear, and asset valuations in exuberant markets are prone to disappoint.  I will discuss the implications for this in our monetary policy discussion tomorrow. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard", " MS. GOODING.  Overall business activity in the Sixth District appears to be little changed since our previous meeting.  Most contacts report steady activity consistent with modest growth.  Although many District retailers noted a sharp pullback in consumer activity in February, that slowdown apparently gave way to a rebound in early March.  Our contacts believe February sales were adversely affected by the IRS delay in distributing refunds and attribute the early March bounce to the resumption of a more typical pace of IRS payouts. If tomorrow\u2019s retail sales report is soft, we may want to look through that weakness. Across a wide array of sectors and businesses, we get the picture of a labor market that appears to be at or very near full employment. Challenges in finding and attracting qualified labor is a persistent theme among our contacts. Although this is not a new story, concerns about actual or potential labor tightening have spread to almost every type of business and worker skill level.  There were more reports of turnover this cycle, particularly at the entry level.  District businesses are responding by offering more bonuses and off-cycle merit increases, increasing flexible time or other quality-of-life policies, and, in some cases, raising their company-wide entry-level wages. We have yet to hear anything that would suggest a widespread acceleration of wage pressures beyond the moderate increases in wage growth that we are seeing in the aggregate data, but my sense is that labor market conditions are on the minds of our contacts and are increasingly a factor in business planning. For example, we hear more and more stories of businesses developing new in-house training programs to expand their potential base of qualified workers. While the wage bill for Southeast businesses appears to have increased moderately, staff survey data suggest that nonlabor input costs have not accelerated appreciably, and profit margins have remained relatively stable.  We are not yet detecting anything in our report suggesting a broad pickup in price-level growth. The risks to my outlook on both the upside and downside revolve around continued uncertainty about fiscal, regulatory, and trade policies.  Remarks from our directors and District contacts on the outlook continue to be optimistic.  However, this optimism is tempered by growing uneasiness about the timing and nature of the policies that will come from the Congress and the Administration.  As one director put it, uncertainty will rule the year. That sentiment was shared by others at the table and echoed by many contacts.  As a result, they are in wait-and-see mode until they gain clarity on potential policy changes.  In other words, our contacts consistently report that their own behavior and thinking exhibits the same disconnect betweenhard facts, reflected in spending and production data, and the strength in the soft data that includes consumer sentiment and business optimism. I do want to emphasize that while most of our contacts are looking to upside risks from potential policy changes, there are downside risks.  Several contacts voiced specific concerns about potential changes to U.S. trade and immigration policies.  Two large retailers with global footprints say they have postponed their planned investment and employment activities until it becomes clear what those policy changes will be. Overall, I have left my projections of growth and inflation mostly unchanged since January.  Last week\u2019s job report gives me a bit more confidence that some of the incoming weakness in the spending and production data is transitory.  But I am not yet taking on the pickup in momentum suggested by the improvement in sentiment since early November, nor do I assume in my projections any particular changes in the path or nature of fiscal policy.  I see real GDP growth continuing at around 2 percent over the next few years.  The recent data on retail prices may be a bit overstated as a result of residual seasonality, but it seems apparent that the trend has moved closer to target.  I\u2019m keeping the risks to my outlook weighted to the upside for the time being.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  I suggest we take a short break to grab some coffee for about 15 minutes and then resume. [Coffee break] CHAIR YELLEN.  Let\u2019s get started again.  Our next speaker is President Harker", " MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Ninth District economy continues to grow moderately.  The latest Minnesota state government estimates indicate the state may have lost jobs in January, but unemployment remains low at around 4 percent.  The owner of several staffing offices in Wisconsin and Minnesota said January job orders were a little bit sketchy, but February seemed to pick up.  North Dakota seems to be generally slowing, though a modest rebound in the oil patch continues. Anecdotal evidence suggests wages in the District are rising at about a 3 percent rate, and manufacturers remain optimistic.  We have asked all of our directors and their contacts and our other contacts if the market\u2019s optimism is translating into actual real economic activity and changes in investment.  And like many of you have articulated, the answer is \u201cno\u201d\u2014it is more just excitement, but no follow-through yet. In terms of the national economy, not much is new.  The expansion continues, but growth remains pretty disappointing.  As others have indicated, the labor market continues to show strong employment gains, with those gains mostly coming from rising labor force participation rather than declining unemployment.  I think, as Governor Brainard mentioned, prime-age labor force participation is now at 81.7 percent\u2014up from a low of 80.6 percent in September 2015 but still significantly below pre-recession levels of around 83 percent. In my view, it is very uncertain how much labor slack remains.  I have only been on the Committee for a little over a year, but I keep hearing us declare that we\u2019re at the natural rate of unemployment, and that this labor force participation story is just temporary and it can\u2019t continue, yet it keeps continuing.  And I don\u2019t know how much longer it can continue.  I have been studying prior tightening cycles over the past three or four decades with my staff, and it is very hard for the Committee to know what the level of maximum employment is, and the Committee is often wrong.  It often overestimates the natural rate of unemployment only to find out that unemployment can go lower without triggering inflation.  And that may well be happening again, I\u2019m not sure. In terms of inflation, again, not much has changed since our previous meeting.  There was little change in core PCE inflation over the intermeeting period\u2014as others have indicated, a strong January at 0.3 percent, but the prior January was also strong.  On a year-on-year basis, core PCE has barely moved.  I find it interesting that so many of us are declaring victory that we are back to our inflation target largely because energy prices have gone up.  We ignored energy prices on the way down.  Why are we declaring victory on the way back up.  Core PCE inflation basically hasn\u2019t moved. What about the inflation outlook.  It\u2019s a mixed bag.  Survey and market-based expectations remain low by historical standards, the dollar remains stable, and nominal wage growth largely remains stable.  Now, it is possible that expansionary fiscal policy may push up inflation, but that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s happening anytime soon.  Financial markets\u2014no change in long-term rates since the previous meeting, no change in the value of the dollar.  Stock markets continue to rise, and prices do seem high relative to standard valuation measures. As others have indicated, uncertainty remains high.  Risks to the upside: lower taxes, lower regulation.  And to the downside: protectionist trade policies, restrictionist immigration policies.  How that uncertainty is resolved will affect the outlook and the appropriate path of rates. So, in conclusion, little real change since the previous meeting.  The economy is headed in the right direction, very slowly.  It\u2019s too soon to declare victory on the inflation front, and it seems like the job market may still have some slack left in it.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Yes", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support alternative B today. As I mentioned yesterday, in my SEP I again assume two rate increases of 25 basis points in 2017.  I see economic activity and inflation evolving pretty much in line with the forecasts I made in December and January, which also were predicated on this policy assumption.  So, not   surprisingly, I don\u2019t see any great urgency for moving today. But since I don\u2019t see today\u2019s rate increase as a commitment to a much different policy rate path from what I currently assume will be appropriate, I can support the decision to raise the funds rate today. I still think we could end up making just two moves this year, but I could imagine three increases as being appropriate if the data come in somewhat stronger than I currently expect. We\u2019ll just have to see, in my opinion.  Even three increases this year would be a gradual funds rate path that gives some deference to risk-management considerations.  We\u2019re still in close proximity to the effective lower bound.  So I can support today\u2019s rate move. Now, the changes in the statement language that occurred between the first and second drafts of the alternatives were big improvements, in my view, and make it much easier for me to go along with alternative B. The first draft came close to declaring victory on our price-stability mandate.  That seemed pretty premature.  Although the recent data have been good, core inflation is still 1.7 percent.  And after some welcome increases in inflation compensation and expectations in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve not seen much further progress this year.  Most measures remain well below pre-crisis levels. I know some might consider our current performance to be close enough to 2 percent to call it a day.  I do think we should consider the fact that Governor Tarullo is going to finish eight years on the Committee without core inflation getting up to 2 percent, certainly not for more than a few months", " MS. GOODING.  Thank you.  The accumulated progress to date on both the employment and inflation objectives supports another step in the direction of removing monetary policy accommodation at this meeting.  Therefore, I support the policy recommendation of a 25 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate that is in alternative B. Outside the employment picture, however, the hard data on real activity that we have in hand has been somewhat weaker than is consistent with our GDP forecast for the year as a whole.  While we do not discount the possibility that first-quarter GDP will begin to look better as more data come in, so far, an increase in business and consumer optimism has not turned into much action.  In addition, the prospects of significant fiscal policy stimulus this year are, if anything, fading.  So before signaling any lean to a more rapid removal of policy accommodation than already embedded in the market expectations, I think it\u2019s prudent to accumulate a bit more information about fiscal policy, about the underlying pace of GDP growth, and about the sustainability of the recent inflation momentum. Regarding the language questions, comments by others about the pivotal nature of this meeting lead me to agree that careful consideration of language change is needed, and I agree with the suggestions made by Presidents Rosengren and Harker to consider changes outside this meeting rather than trying to make such changes here.   As I said in my comments yesterday and as was discussed further by President Rosengren this morning, I would also support adding language affirming the key elements of the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, signaling that the Committee is turning attention toward the reinvestment plan to reduce the balance sheet. I could also support the wording changes that President Lacker suggested in paragraph 1, with the verb tense changes; I also like the change to the word \u201cfluctuate\u201d rather than \u201cstabilize.\u201d That concludes my comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.  President Williams", " WILLIAMS.  The past participle is, I think, what we prefer to use in paragraph 1.  So I would switch the sentences on inflation. I think it does create what I always dislike in our writing\u2014when we repeat phrases over and over.  We\u2019ll say \u201cwas little changed\u201d or \u201chas been little changed\u201d twice.  But I do think that sentence should be in the past participle. My last comment is about Governor Fischer\u2019s remarks, which I was following very closely.  I think that the argument you make about inflation overshooting the mark and needing to raise unemployment to 5.9 percent actually doesn\u2019t apply.  And the reason is that\u2014I\u2019m going to speak on behalf of the way I understand the staff forecast, which is, they actually have assumed or built into that forecast that, currently, long-run inflation expectations are below 2 percent. The reason why we need to juice the economy for so long is not only to raise wage and price pressure, but also to move inflation expectations back to 2 percent.  So there are two battles we\u2019re fighting to get inflation back to 2 percent.  If we had inflation expectations back at 2 percent and we got some shock to push inflation up, then we wouldn\u2019t need to be fighting that  battle.  And there the ability for inflation to come back to 2 percent with relatively minor movements in unemployment would be in place. So I think that it\u2019s not right to apply the same symmetry\u2014that we need this huge period of really tight labor markets to get inflation up a few tenths, because it\u2019s really about inflation expectations being anchored at the wrong place.  That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.  [Laughter]  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, given progress toward our objectives.  With the changes we\u2019ve seen in inflation, I think the statement changes are appropriate, but I share some of the concerns raised by President Lacker about those changes and would look forward to future discussions about the statement. I want to make just a brief observation on something a little bit different, and that is the reintroduction of core inflation into paragraph 1 as an alternative measure to looking at the distance we are from the longer-run headline inflation objective.  I do recall that in the past, we\u2019ve had to deal with some public reaction to talking about core inflation in our communications, and I\u2019m always sensitive that we could be potentially sending a message to the public that we are discounting food and energy prices that, in fact, affect people\u2019s cost of living. So my preference had been the construction we had been using when energy prices were pushing down.  We noted that those were temporary.  And I think that in this instance, it would also be appropriate to say there are certain things that are temporarily boosting headline inflation in the same way so that we have a consistent expression.  I think if we hang on to core inflation, that could create some difficulties for us down the road with the public.  Again, I\u2019m not suggesting we have to change that today, but I think that could come up.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I\u2019ll have some comments on the language in a bit. As I see it, the grounds for gradually removing monetary policy accommodation are very much in place.  We\u2019re relatively close to our employment and inflation objectives at a time that the federal funds rate is still very low and we judge monetary policy as still being accommodative.  We further expect that the economy will continue to grow at an above-trend pace, and, despite our actions to make monetary policy less accommodative, financial conditions have become easier.  All of this points to a removal of accommodation at today\u2019s meeting.  I would expect that the decision today will be of little surprise to anyone, given our recent efforts to align market expectations more closely with our views.  I want to talk just briefly about yesterday\u2019s discussion.  I was very pleased by the discussion we had on reinvestment and the balance sheet.  I think there\u2019s more to do there to develop a coherent strategy among the Committee, and I just would strongly encourage us to do that at the next couple of FOMC meetings, because I think we really want to get that wrapped up so we\u2019re ready to go as soon as, potentially, the third quarter.  So I think we\u2019re making good progress, but we need to continue to move on that path. In terms of language, on paragraph 4 and President Lacker\u2019s suggestion to remove that sentence, I think that\u2019s too far.  I think that declares victory on inflation, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate with us still being below our 2 percent objective.  I really do think we need to spend some time at or above 2 percent before we can actually declare victory. On paragraph 2, President Lacker suggested the word \u201cfluctuate\u201d rather than \u201cstabilize.\u201d  I think \u201cfluctuate\u201d is actually probably more accurate than \u201cstabilize,\u201d so I\u2019m certainly open to that suggestion, but I don\u2019t feel strongly about it.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.  The key word in that sentence is \u201caround.\u201d  That\u2019s really the key word rather than the word \u201cstabilize\u201d or \u201cfluctuate.\u201d In paragraph 1, I certainly agree that the tenses should be the same.  I guess I would say that if you want to be parallel to the sentence on job gains, you should say \u201cinflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent,\u201d as opposed to \u201cwas\u201d and \u201chas continued.\u201d I think we want to have the tenses consistent across the paragraph, not just in that single sentence.  It\u2019s a very small point. As far as President Harker\u2019s suggestion to put in language in paragraph 3\u2014\u201cand consistent with\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.  I think what we\u2019re really trying to signal at this   meeting is that we\u2019re removing monetary policy accommodation because the economy is evolving in the way we expected\u2014no drama\u2014so I don\u2019t think we need that emphasis. Finally, as this is Dan\u2019s last meeting, I think it\u2019s proper for me, as the Vice Chairman of this Committee, to say a few words.  I want to recognize all that he\u2019s done for the Federal Reserve and the FOMC.  Although I didn\u2019t coordinate my comments with the Chair, unlike in the case of some other recent matters, my remarks are very much in a similar vein. Dan, you\u2019ve always come very well prepared to the FOMC meetings.  You made many meaningful contributions on monetary policy and its execution in your eight years on the Committee. I agree with Eric\u2014I much preferred when you were on my side rather than in opposition.  When you were in opposition, you were a very worthy advocate, and we had some pretty good debates. You more than held your own in debating and discussing the outlook with all of these Ph.D. economists, myself included, and that\u2019s quite an achievement at the Federal Reserve. While this will be a mere coda in your Federal Reserve career compared with your role in changing how we supervise large systemically important firms, how we\u2019ve implemented the CCAR process, and how we pushed through the regulatory overhaul that was surely necessary following the financial crisis, you also deserve considerable credit on the monetary policy side for taking your role here seriously and making many important contributions.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. Let me just start by saying that I\u2019ve heard many of you around the table suggest that, as we come close to achieving our goals, perhaps we rethink the structure of the statement.  I\u2019m more than open to doing that, and we will work on that and try to get back to you.  I do want to go through one by one now the various suggestions that have been made for changes.  Starting in paragraph 1, on the tense issue, I\u2019ve heard the suggestion and take the Vice Chairman\u2019s modification that we might change the tenses in the clause beginning \u201cexcluding energy and food prices . . .\u201d to say \u201cinflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.\u201d President Lacker", " MR. BULLARD. Yes.  I think it is a subtle matter, but we are playing a hairsplitting game, and I think that the trajectory is much more important than the move today. So I think there would be\u2014potentially, anyway\u2014a lot of focus on this. In previous tightening cycles, we\u2019ve gone as much as 300 basis points in a year.  Even in the 2004\u201306 tightening cycle, we moved at every meeting.  So what you\u2019re doing here is at least putting some probability that you might do something more akin to what we\u2019ve done in the past, whereas I think the \u201conly gradual\u201d has shut that down.  It is saying something about, well, potentially we\u2019d go faster. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kashkari", " MR. KASHKARI.  Yes.  I would just say, all things being equal, I would rather keep it.  I agree that the distinction, just purely looking at the language, is very subtle.  But the striking of it will be absolutely noticed, and I think it will be interpreted as a very \u201chawkish\u201d development\u2014 maybe overinterpreted.  So maybe this kind of a change could be wrapped into the broader changes that we consider at a later date. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fisher"], "2017FOMC20170503meeting.txt": ["MR. WILCOX.  I don\u2019t have confidence intervals for the measure that\u2019s shown on the left.  It parallels pretty closely the one in panel 4 on the right.  Thomas, do you have one", " MS. BRAINARD.  I just have a comment to say I think I\u2019m probably one of the people that you\u2019re referring to who has raised this.  The won has depreciated very substantially in a very short period in response to some geostrategic concerns, so I would also question that judgment", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, want to thank the staff for their ongoing work on the QS assessment.  I find these helpful, and especially the Federal Home Loan Bank analysis this time. I want to echo, a little bit, the comments of Governor Fischer. When I look at the report on leverage in the financial sector remaining low and capital ratios at the bank holding companies that are high by historical standards, as it relates to the largest firms, I find this encouraging.  But I\u2019d have to say, my own level of concern about this vulnerability has gone up in light of some of the discussions we hear today about potential regulatory reform, which of course is yet to be fully defined. It\u2019s true that the largest banking firms were considered to have high capital ratios by historical standards, certainly in a relative sense, given levels in 2008 that required taxpayer support.  But judging their capital be adequate relative to the risk they pose to the broader economy is going to warrant ongoing scrutiny.  When you look at international accounting standards, which restrict the netting of derivatives, these largest firms hold an equity-to-asset ratio of 6 percent, while the smallest U.S. banks, by the same measure, hold more than 10 percent.  I would also note that if you go back to the time before government safety nets, these largest firms held between 12 and 15 percent.  The other important characteristic in this report is the vulnerability associated with interconnectedness.  And on this dimension, again, I think it\u2019s reassuring to see a decline in intrafinancial system assets and liabilities as a result of regulations such as capital surcharges, liquidity coverage ratios, net stable funding ratios, and reductions in bilaterally cleared derivatives. So the report\u2019s conclusion that these firms are less connected seems right to me. But, again, in a relative sense, as their assets compose a greater share of GDP, it seems to me that the economy remains vulnerable to these linkages, and it\u2019s a reminder of the ongoing importance of applying strong capital regulation and supervision to these firms.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard, did you want to comment", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My directors and other contacts continue to be upbeat and even a bit more positive than in March.  Much of this optimism is still driven by as-yet-unrealized hopes for the future.  However, I did hear a few more reports this time of firms actually experiencing increases in demand.  Among manufacturers, order books were up for some heavy equipment producers, notably those supplying the construction sector, and both Caterpillar and ArcelorMittal reported signs of some recovery in oil and gas activities. Caterpillar also noted that international demand had improved, particularly in China, where it expected government policies to support strong sales of construction equipment for at least another few months.  This is the peak construction season there, I\u2019m told. In contrast, Ford and GM were less positive this round.  In March, our contacts had hoped that sales would stabilize near the 17\u00bd million pace seen in January and February, but March and April sales were disappointing, which leaves them with some decisions to make about production plans.  That said, they still expect 2017 sales at the 17\u00bc million pace, only a little below the record for the previous two years.  Furthermore, other business reports discounted the first-quarter slowdown in overall consumer spending.  Notably, my director from Discover Financial was pretty upbeat and indicated that credit card receipts seem more robust than the NIPA consumption data.  Labor markets appear to be moving forward at a pace similar to recent months, and this would tighten conditions further.  I continue to hear many of the same old complaints about shortages of skilled workers, but I also heard a few more stories about businesses actually doing something about it.  For example, there were more reports of firms trying to fill shortages of skilled labor by expanding training programs, often in conjunction with community colleges, and some temp help and placement firms said that they have convinced more of their client companies of the need to boost wages if they want to get and keep their jobs filled.  One agency in Michigan told customers they would no longer accept any orders for light industrial office or service workers at under $11 per hour.  This compares with a minimum wage of $8.90.  This firm regularly adjusts such wage cutoff points to match market conditions.  When wages are below the threshold, turnover is too great and it finds it too tough to meet its hiring and retention guarantees to its clients. Turning to the national outlook, we made only minor changes to our real GDP growth projections.  And like the Tealbook, we nudged our core inflation outlook down 0.1 percentage point this year, but we still expect inflation will sustainably reach our 2 percent objective by 2019. My uncertainty over all of these forecasts is a bit higher than it was in March.  First, I\u2019m a little concerned that the weak first-quarter consumption figure may contain more signal than assumed in our outlook.  The softer April motor vehicle numbers reinforce this perception a bit. Second, in my outlook I continue to assume a modest fiscal stimulus that begins later this year with a boost in defense spending and then adds in tax cuts of some form in 2018.  But the Administration\u2019s opening bid makes our tax cut assumption seem paltry.  On the other hand, it\u2019snot clear what kind of tax package is going to get through the Congress or when we might see it.  So uncertainty over fiscal policy is even higher now than before. Finally, on inflation, there is the downward surprise in the March releases.  I do not want to read too much into one month, so for now I am willing to put it aside and await more data.  But the March surprise does make me a bit more uncertain about the current trajectory of inflation. I hope we will have enough information in hand at our June meeting to know whether the recent consumption and inflation data were just temporary hiccups or something more that would require a change to our baseline forecast.  And maybe we\u2019ll have more clarity by then on the fiscal policy picture as well.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard", " MS. GOODING.  In general, Sixth District contacts noted that after a weak January and an even weaker February, activity rebounded in March.  However, their sense was the rebound was just enough to eke out a slight gain for the quarter, consistent with last Friday\u2019s GDP report. The uncertainty theme expressed by our contacts in the period leading up to the January and March FOMC meetings continues.  Most contacts are holding back on major expansion plans, waiting for a desirable set of tax and regulatory policies that they hope will materialize. Though this upside risk is still the dominant view among our contacts and directors, in this cycle we began to pick up a downside risk wait-and-see theme associated in particular with emerging and potential changes in trade policy and international relations.  District firms that engage in international trade or have globally integrated supply chains report that global demand appears to be accelerating.  But, despite the improvement in the global outlook, we heard multiple reports ofreluctance to expand or initiate significant capital investments out of concern that changes in trade policy may negatively affect the demand for U.S. exports. A troubling example of potential problems on the trade front came from our Travel and Tourism Advisory Council.  Contacts affiliated with destinations that primarily cater to domestic tourists continue to report strong demand.  In contrast, contacts that cater to foreign travelers noted a sharp falloff in international visitors in areas that are popular with foreign tourists. Though there may be multiple reasons for this development, our contacts definitely perceive that the emerging stances on trade and immigration policy have diminished the interest in the United States as a destination for foreign travelers.  Tourism is just a piece of a broader issue. Across contacts in many sectors, there is a growing concern that policy developments will have a negative effect on the environment for conducting international business. Turning to the labor market, reports of tightening conditions continue.  Nonetheless, wage growth appears to be generally stable.  Overall, I have left my outlook largely unchanged.  Like the Tealbook, I am discounting much of the weakness in the first-quarter data. It appears that delayed tax refunds, unusually warm weather in January and February, and possible residual seasonality have affected the top-line GDP figure.  On the seasonality point, however, we have noted that much of the first-quarter weakness was due to a sharp decline in consumption growth. Previous work by the Board\u2019s staff and the Bureau of Economic Analysis suggests that consumption expenditures is a component of GDP that has not, in the past, exhibited significant residual seasonality.  I\u2019m concerned about the outlook for consumer spending but not enough to shake me from my baseline forecast. On inflation, I view much of the recent softness as transitory.  Still, price pressure appeared to be muted, even after excluding some of the most unusual price swings, as captured,   for example, by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean inflation measure. I am sticking to my previous forecast of near 2 percent inflation over the balance of the year.  However, the latest fallback in both headline and core inflation adds yet another month to the surfeit of below-target inflation readings we have experienced since the last recession.  This is unwelcome if the public does not see the inflation target as truly symmetric.  I will have more to say on this topic in the policy round tomorrow.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", "MR. KAPLAN.  I\u2019ll just ask a follow-up to that.  If it\u2019s your view that the natural rate of unemployment is really just under 5 percent, you would expect us to start seeing more intensifying price pressures than what we\u2019re seeing.  The definition of \u201cnatural rate\u201d is the rate at which you would expect to start seeing price pressures, and maybe we will start seeing them, but they\u2019ve been muted.  What does that tell you about the appropriate natural rate.  Does it make you want to rethink or maybe revise your views", " MR. LAUBACH. As you surely noticed, there are some suggestions to that effect in the staff memo that was sent on April 21.  I guess one of the issues that you are going to discuss tomorrow is when is the appropriate time to send what signal through the statement.  The staff in its proposal for the communications basically chose the same structure as in the original normalization principles of keeping the question of the appropriate timing of any change in reinvestment policy out of the \u201cprinciples,\u201d let\u2019s call them, and assuming that it would be handled in paragraph 5 of the statement. And then there is the question, at which stage do you want to send signals.  For example, if you were to put out principles of the nature that we discussed in the memo, one of the questions for you is whether you would then make a first change to paragraph 5 or whether you would wait until you feel more confident that you are going to make a change fairly soon.  That\u2019s one of the issues, I think, in front of you", " MR. BULLARD.  But you could say the size of the balance sheet would be big anyway and so it wouldn\u2019t matter that much", " MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Yesterday\u2019s discussion revealed an FOMC that views the first quarter of 2017 as, on the whole, consistent with continuing our plan of   following a data-dependent path of increasing the federal funds rate gradually until we reach the point when we should stop doing that.  However, in view of the weakness of first-quarter real GDP growth and questions about the ability of the Administration to implement its ambitious plans for the economy, there was no enthusiasm at all for increasing the interest rate at this meeting.  In paragraphs 1 through 3, alternative B makes a strong case for not acting on the interest rate now while leaving open the possibility of continuing on the path of having three changes in the interest rate in 2017 that emerged from the December 2016 SEP.  That seems to be the right decision and the right explanation for the decision, and I therefore support alternative B. I\u2019d like now to return to an issue I raised at the March FOMC meeting and essentially repeat what I said a month and a half ago, with a few changes to update my statement. We\u2019re very close to attaining both our unemployment and inflation goals.  The real interest rate will still be negative if and after we raise the rate in June. And r* has probably risen in the aftermath of a change in animal spirits, a change that, for its validation, still awaits policy actions consistent with a new implied higher r*, but that has had a significant effect on stock market and other asset valuations.  There\u2019s a term we can use instead of \u201cwealth\u201d:  \u201casset values.\u201d  \u201cFurther, the expected growth rate of the rest of the world\u2019s economy has risen,\u201d and that\u2019s a quote. Then I added, \u201cOf course, there are storm clouds on the horizon, particularly those related to potential political developments in Europe, in the critical round of elections that will continue until near the end of the year.\u201d  While those storm clouds have begun to dissipate, and we hope they\u2019ll dissipate further following France\u2019s election on Sunday, they are still a big issue in this Committee\u2019s deliberations. The staff forecast takes us to an unemployment rate that might very well be close to 4 percent by 2020.  The staff calculation is that u*, the full employment rate of unemployment, is 4.9 percent. So why are we heading off on a long journey to increase the divergence between u and u* before returning u to u* on a path that is not specified in the table in the current Tealbook, but that is discussed on page 24 of Tealbook A. Well, after helpful discussions with the staff in March, I understand that we need that decrease in unemployment to get the inflation rate up to 2 percent, and, taking into account what we now believe about the Phillips curve, that makes arithmetic sense. So far, so good.  Now, suppose we faced the opposite problem and that we currently had an inflation rate of 2.3 percent with an unemployment rate of 5.2 percent.  We\u2019d need a higher unemployment rate in order to reduce the inflation rate and would presumably head off on a trajectory to 5.9 percent unemployment in order to get to the inflation target, by the logic of the path we\u2019re presenting in the Tealbook.  Would we think it makes sense to raise the unemployment rate to well above u* to get rid of 0.3 percentage point of inflation.  I don\u2019t think so, and I doubt anyone else here thinks so either. So what should we do.  In the interest of near brevity, I will not repeat the four possibilities I raised in March.  I will repeat one of them and have added a fifth.  Repetition:  We could look at episodes similar to those that would be implied by an economy behaving like the economy at the beginning of Tealbook A.  A large and talented team of Federal Reserve economists has done that.  And their bottom line is that we are unable to draw clear conclusions. My conclusion from that is that working with certainty equivalence of a distance that\u2019s quite far from the optimum is very dangerous and that the uncertainties about what could happen on a path that goes from 4.9 to 4.0 percent are very large and have to be factored into our policies. And then I\u2019ve added another thing we could do.  We could undertake a policy of opportunistic optimization\u2014something that I now believe somebody said was introduced to this body by Don Kohn\u2014in which you wait for opportunities to reduce the gaps between where the economy is and the bliss point, but rule out ambitious paths that history tells us have only a low chance of succeeding. It\u2019s well known that the Federal Reserve has, in the past, typically operated by tending to move the interest rate in a serially correlated fashion from one range to another.  One can imagine that being an optimal approach.  It may be optimal when the distance from the target is large, but it is not clearly optimal when you\u2019re very close to the target and you\u2019re going to depart very far from the target. I believe we need to consider how this Committee should best set interest rates in years to come in a way that preferably does not include more long marches.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker", " MS. GOODING.  Thank you.  My economic projections have not changed materially since the previous meeting, and I currently assume two additional rate increases this year. After our move in March, I think it is appropriate to be patient and wait for more evidence on the underlying strength in economic activity and inflation before pulling the trigger on the next rate increase. Therefore, I support the policy action in alternative B, and I\u2019m fine with the language in the current draft statement, although I would be fine with the change that President Kashkari mentioned as well. As I suggested yesterday, I do think the effort to convince the public that our inflation goal is truly symmetric may be challenging as we continue the process of removing policy accommodation.  Over the intermeeting period, my staff included a special question in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Business Inflation Expectation survey asking about firms\u2019 perceptions of the FOMC\u2019s tolerance for inflation above or below its target.  Only 25 percent of respondents indicated they believed the Committee\u2019s inflation goal is symmetric.  The modal response, from 38 percent of respondents, was the opinion that the FOMC has greater concern about inflation running above its target than it does about inflation running below target. We conducted the same poll of our directors at last week\u2019s Atlanta board meeting.  The majority of our board members, including representatives from our five branches, responded that they also believe the FOMC has greater tolerance for inflation below target than above target.  When we pushed on why, the response was basically that inflation has been running below 2 percent for a long time, yet the FOMC has tightened policy, so it seems it doesn\u2019t want to risk   inflation getting above 2 percent.  I\u2019ll note that our survey was taken after the March statement in which the symmetry language was included.  Our survey results suggest to me that communications about the symmetry of our inflation goal have not completely taken hold, and that\u2019s something that the Committee may want to consider in the future.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I am comfortable omitting the reference to \u201cwealth\u201d from the statement. Otherwise, I support alternative B as written.  In light of recent relatively sluggish economic growth as well as broader secular headwinds, I agree with taking no action today. My base case for this year continues to be for a total of three rate hikes, including the one we did in March.  I also believe we should sometime later this year begin the process of allowing the balance sheet to run off.  I do think, though, it is appropriate to emphasize that we should remove accommodation in a gradual and patient manner.  \u201cGradual and patient\u201d means to me that if and when we see, as we have, weak economic data, we have the ability to take time to review more data before we take further action. And I certainly intend to do that. Lastly, I\u2019m cognizant that structural and fiscal policies may cause me to revise my outlook for economic growth and amend my views regarding monetary policy, but I don\u2019t take as a given that the net effect of policies being discussed will be positive for economic growth.  In  particular, potential health-care reform policies, immigration policies, and trade policies, as well as the rhetoric associated with them, are examples of policies that I believe may be negative for real GDP growth. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, and I agree with President Kashkari on his suggestion about removing \u201cwealth\u201d for the reasons he articulated and others have said.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.  I think the whole point of that clause is just to be slightly more positive about the underlying fundamentals for the household sector, and I think the real income and sentiment cover that. I will very briefly tilt against the windmill here. I\u2019ve argued for a long time that this effort in paragraph 1\u2014to go into all of the gory details of the data and to try to capture every bit of the news since the previous meeting\u2014is problematic.  I think monetary policy works with pretty long lags, and we need to be very forward looking.  And I think sometimes we get ourselves into these situations in which we put in new language one time and then take it out, and put in the new language again.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always as constructive as it could be.  But my point here was that I would delete \u201cwealth.\u201d But, overall, the language appropriately looks through the first-quarter transitory noise.  The sentence in paragraph 2 does a good job on that and positions us well, as many have said, either to raise the federal funds rate in June, barring a meaningful deterioration in the outlook, or to reassess the data.  So I think it hits the right tone there. We have reached or exceeded full employment with underlying inflation only modestly below our 2 percent goal.  Furthermore, with the momentum in the economy that we discussed yesterday, we could be well beyond full employment in the next year or two.  That\u2019s why, like  the Tealbook, I expect economic conditions, particularly the outlook, to support three more rate increases this year and the start of normalization of the balance sheet also by late this year. I think this is a sensible policy approach on the basis of my modal forecast.  But risk-management considerations also support a continued gradual path of rate increases.  As President Rosengren and others have mentioned, there\u2019s a very real risk of overheating the economy significantly.  Pushing the unemployment rate well below its natural rate means that we will need to eventually correct that, and that will generate very slow growth for a number of years as we try to get the economy back in a sustainable place. Also, the possibility of sizable fiscal stimulus does argue on net\u2014although I agree completely with President Kaplan\u2019s remarks that the fiscal and other policies could actually cut either way\u2014for positioning ourselves to adjust the path of policy by taking a rate increase sooner rather than later.  Then we can adjust later as we learn more about what the policies are. Lastly, I\u2019ll note that I think that we can separate the reinvestment policy decisions we\u2019re going to be making from the near-term funds rate path.  Obviously, they\u2019re connected.  They are both highly relevant to thinking about the stance of monetary policy.  I do think it\u2019s important to remind ourselves that the market\u2019s expectations today about the trajectory of our balance sheet look about right, and markets have taken our hints of impending normalization in stride.  So our future announcements on balance sheet normalization will essentially confirm our past communications and market expectations, and, therefore, I don\u2019t expect an overly adverse market reaction as we move forward with the balance sheet normalization. I would like to comment very briefly on Governor Powell\u2019s remarks about losing an inflation anchor or the nominal anchor after many years of inflation running below target, or the risks of that.  I am also very concerned about that aspect of having inflation\u2014a number of people  talked about this\u2014continuously or consistently run below target and then eroding people\u2019s expectations of inflation. We heard some evidence on that about whether our target really is symmetric.  I think that what we need to do is get inflation convincingly back to 2 percent.  That means at least a 50 percent probability of being above 2 percent, and I think that\u2019s something we need to do to make sure that we don\u2019t lose this anchor. I would like to mention that if we thought, in the future, about perhaps a better framework for thinking about this issue, if we had some type of price-level target rather than inflation target, this would need to be completely built in.  If we undershot our target for many years, you would eventually have to overshoot it later. I\u2019m not arguing for that for today. Obviously, we\u2019re not doing that, but I think this experience for the past eight years reminds at least me of the challenges in a world in which the effective lower bound is binding a lot, and we could again find ourselves with inflation running significantly under target for a number of years. I think we need to think about that future.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MR. FISCHER.  Madam Chair, if I thought that putting the word \u201cwealth\u201d in implied that there\u2019s a put on the FOMC every time the stock market goes down, I might agree, but \u201cwealth\u201d is such a common word.  We\u2019re going to take it out and never use it again because it gives this connotation.  It seems to me ridiculous, and I don\u2019t see why we should go down this route of political correctness, when it\u2019s not even logical. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we do the same thing with the exchange rate\u2014we\u2019re very loath to mention the exchange rate.  I think, similarly, it certainly matters for both net exports and national income, as well as inflation.  However, we go to great lengths not to mention the exchange rate for a similar reason\u2014to avoid any possible misinterpretation that we have a target for the exchange rate. So I think that\u2019s also an example of \u201cpolitical correctness", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The problem with that is that it seems insensitive to all those households that don\u2019t have strong balance sheets. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019ve long argued that we should normalize monetary policy through balance sheet normalization first and interest rate normalization later.  I thought that we should have normalized the yield curve effects\u2014the \u201ctwist\u201d effects on the yield curve that we got through balance sheet policy, at least according to our rhetoric.  We didn\u2019t go  that way, and now I think we have some contradictions in how we\u2019re approaching policy.  I think that, to an outsider, it looks like the balance sheet part of the policy is pretty easy or as easy as it was even at the height of the crisis, whereas we\u2019re proceeding with interest rate normalization and telling everyone that the economy is getting better.  And I think this is, in my mind, not ideal.  This is why I\u2019ve been an advocate of getting going on normalizing the balance sheet.  In my view, we\u2019re way behind schedule on this, so I do think we should get going.  I do think the revised proposal is reasonable, and I appreciate the staff efforts to put this together.  I am struck by how cautious this is.  This is quite cautious\u2014maybe excessively cautious.  Because it\u2019s a very cautious proposal and almost nothing happens during the early months of ending the reinvestment policy, I think we could actually move ahead with this quite quickly, perhaps during the summer.  Frankly, I think it could be implemented right now without much effect because almost nothing happens initially. There\u2019s been talk here about the taper and the worry that we might induce a taper tantrum.  So let me give you \u201cJim\u2019s view of the taper tantrum,\u201d which is that I would like to remind the Committee that we actually did nothing in terms of tangible action in June 2013, nor did we take any tangible action in September 2013.  The actual taper began only in December 2013, and, at that point, there was no ripple in global financial markets.  In fact, the entire taper went on without incident, in my view. What was happening at the time of June 2013 was all about communication and all about the unexpected effect on markets because they didn\u2019t realize what the Committee was thinking. And I\u2019d just remind the Committee that the decision that day was to do nothing with the statement but to send the Chairman out to give a press conference that would explain how we were going to approach the taper.  I think that didn\u2019t work out very well in retrospect, because   the Committee actually did not have a plan.  But here we\u2019re talking about something that\u2019s well communicated and will be easily understood, and I would expect the whole thing to come off without much effect. On a broader point, I think the Committee has to be realistic that we\u2019re probably going to have to consider quantitative easing at some point in the future.  The policy rate probably will be driven back to the zero bound at the point of another recession.  Recessions, I\u2019m sure, have not gone away.  So there will be one at some point in the future.  And, in my opinion, we should be doing more to create the policy space that we\u2019re going to need to at least be able to entertain a possible quantitative easing program at that juncture.  So, in my opinion, we should be doing more to create the policy space now by shrinking the size of the balance sheet during relatively good times. This proposal is okay, but it\u2019s generally extremely slow from the perspective of creating a better optionality for the Committee in future recession states.  So I would be open to considering ways to speed this up in the future.  I wouldn\u2019t do that now\u2014we\u2019re trying to get the program under way\u2014but it may be something that we want to consider further down the road.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I suggest we take a 10- or 15-minute coffee break.  We\u2019re making good progress, and we\u2019ll come back and finish up. [Coffee break] CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay, folks, let us resume.  Our next speaker is Governor Fischer", " MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I struggle with these caps.  At first, I liked them.  The more I thought about them, the less excited I got about them, and here\u2019s why.  First, substantively, I can\u2019t figure out why we need them.  I think about Lorie\u2019s explanation about the Treasury market.  The Treasury will know when these refundings are due. It can prefund.  I don\u2019t see a market-functioning issue arising unless the U.S. government is running huge budget deficits\u2014which is the Treasury\u2019s problem, not our problem, to deal with.  Second, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re selling off our portfolio.  This is literally the bond just coming due on schedule, so I don\u2019t really see how the caps are necessary for the Treasury securities market. And, by the way, there are lots of professors saying the world is short of safe assets, so I further don\u2019t see this as being a problem.  If you take the MBS side of the market, the only way this is a problem is if rates drop and then people refinance quickly.  But we\u2019ve already said that if rates drop, we may suspend this program anyway.  So I don\u2019t feel like this is a real problem that we\u2019re going to have in either the MBS market or the Treasury securities market.  The best argument I have for caps or a phaseout is just a psychological one\u2014that maybe, on the margin, it\u2019s less likely to trigger some form of a taper tantrum.  And that may well be a good enough reason to do it, but, just hearing the arguments, I don\u2019t see a technical reason why we need to have these caps. In terms of the specific questions, I would prefer a slightly shorter phaseout\u201412 months rather than 18\u2014though I don\u2019t feel strongly about this. I do support putting out something in June because the most important thing we can do is to give markets as much advance warning as possible so there are no surprises.  And I would saythat if the Desk is going to put out some form of an operational memo, I would encourage that sooner, maybe even in June if it\u2019s ready, rather than delaying it. I like the idea of making this date based.  I agree with President Williams and others.  Around year-end feels right to me.  It gives markets plenty of advance warning.  I don\u2019t like the idea of tying it to a federal funds rate hike, because that, then, becomes a momentous move, as opposed to just putting this in the background and letting it take its own course. Lastly, I also agree with President Williams that if we\u2019re going to call it a floor system, let\u2019s just call it a floor system. When I saw \u201cautonomous factors,\u201d it raised all sorts of questions in my mind:  \u201cWhat does this mean.  Oh, it means a floor system.\u201d Why don\u2019t we just call it a floor system.

I would want to note, just for everyone\u2019s reference, that in exhibit 2 of the second briefing, part of the Desk statement would be to outline the plan as described in the Committee\u2019s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  So, of course, the Committee could decide to make changes and deviate from the plan, but this would be provided in the initial Desk statement.  I think there would be some expectation in the market that this would generally be on autopilot through that time period. CHAIR YELLEN.  President George", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So then the question is, well, why is the FOMC going in July\u2014in a non\u2013press conference meeting. It creates a little bit more confusion in the marketplace with, what\u2019s the rush. CHAIR YELLEN.  Especially when the draft statement says that we will do this assuming incoming data are in line with expectations, and there would not be much data in that short a span", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes. If I could interject:  What I worry about a little bit is if you move in July, there\u2019s going to be a lot of speculation that you\u2019re moving in July because you are worried about the debt limit, which in some ways then amps that up as a potential issue for the market.  And I think, from our perspective, we should be as far away from the debt limitissue as we possibly can be in terms of not contributing to speculation that we\u2019re doing things because of the debt limit.  Just my personal opinion. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell", " MR. FISCHER.  I disagree.

You\u2019re doing this right in the face of a debt ceiling crisis. I think if we got going now, we would just say, \u201cWell, the time is right, and we\u2019ve got the plans.

You were talking about the debate you were having about whether to lower the natural rate of unemployment, and I heard some arguments on both sides.  I guess I would ask you, what\u2019s the strongest argument, in your view, for not moving the natural rate of unemployment lower", " MR. KASHKARI.  Or if anyone\u2014David or Thomas", " WILLIAMS.  I\u2019ll go back to my question.  Stacey, going back to this issue of the alternative scenario and fiscal policy assumptions on exhibit 3 in your presentation\u2014so I actually thought this was a tricky scenario to grapple with myself.  You have this roughly one-third probability, according to the prediction markets, that there are going to be these tax cuts\u2014 and a lot of uncertainty about this.  We\u2019ve seen the markets move since November\u2014the bond market come down, the dollar come down, and stock markets stay high.  So when you actually run this scenario, my understanding on the basis of reading the Tealbook and listening to your comments is that what\u2019s really driving the scenario is not the change in the formulation of fiscal policy itself\u2014the government, taxes, and things like that\u2014but actually shifts in the sentiment and financial conditions as people decide that this is not going to happen.  But the probabilities have already come down a lot.  So how do you assess that.  You\u2019re basically either in your baseline making an assumption that people are going to say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s actually happening,\u201d so they\u2019re going to be more optimistic than they are today.  And in the alternative, you\u2019re going to say that they\u2019re going to be a little bit more pessimistic, but they\u2019re already placing a low probability. That was a long sentence, and it went all over the place, but you\u2019re kind of stuck.  Your baseline is a probabilistic thing, and this alternative is probabilistic.  So how did you come up with these particular numbers", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Stacey, your answer to the question about what\u2019s going on with inflation was that it\u2019s either noise in the data or we\u2019ve got the wrong natural rate of unemployment.  And I\u2019ve been concerned about this for the Committee that the natural rate of unemployment is kind of a free parameter, and if inflation is not behaving the way we expect, that we just move the natural rate of unemployment around.  It makes it seem like it\u2019s not a falsifiable theory. Is there some point at which we would say, \u201cOkay, this isn\u2019t working, and maybe we should look at some other model, maybe consider a little bit of weight on other models of inflation\u201d", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Eighth District economic activity continues to increase at a modest pace, and contacts continue to hold a generally optimistic outlook for the remainder of 2017.  However, the rise in business and consumer optimism witnessed in recent District surveys appears to have abated.  It now seems that much of that optimism was tied to election and post-election exuberance.  Actual sales data from business contacts in the District have been relatively weak, on balance, in recent months.  District labor market conditions continued to improve, with modest employment growth and moderate growth in wages", " MR. BOSTIC.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Reports from contacts in the Sixth District suggested that business activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace.  This is consistent with our assessment that the tepid spending numbers we saw in the first quarter were likely an aberration.  This assessment notwithstanding, feedback from the District suggested that there were some growing clouds on the horizon.  Sentiment from our contacts in the auto industry was particularly dour.  Auto sales have slowed recently, and most of our contacts do not expect that trend to reverse anytime soon. District automakers reported a material decrease in production, citing high and rising inventory levels.  At least one large District manufacturer has begun to cut staffing levels, and other contacts suggested that they may follow suit.   One director representing a large nationally based retail auto organization cited three indicators of concern regarding the health of the new-autos market.  Incentives on new vehicles are very high.  Leasing rates, as a fraction of sales, are much higher than normal\u201430 percent versus the typical 20 percent.  And those leases are apparently exclusively financed by the manufacturers themselves.  As the director suggested, banks wouldn\u2019t touch them.  Combining this with the high inventory levels, the view is that further production cuts are likely, perhaps by the end of the year. Similarly, the recent turnaround in business fixed investment over the past two quarters has been encouraging.  However, a sizable share of that turnaround in the first quarter was tied to a rebound in the oil and gas sector, and our industry contacts suggested that some of that increased activity was due to the need for companies to punch a hole in order to avoid loss of leased drilling rights.  The inference was that we shouldn\u2019t expect continued strength in the sector absent an unexpected rise in oil prices. As I understand it, one theme around this table for the past few rounds has been the apparent disconnect between sentiment, sometimes referred to as soft data, and behavior, which is tied to hard data.  To that end, I and my staff asked contacts and directors about their current level of optimism and, more importantly, how business decisions are being affected by any changes in sentiment.  The response was that businesses are still somewhat optimistic with regard to the prospects for expansionary fiscal and government policies, but that the euphoria has died down as skepticism has grown about the prospects for legislative action. I was particularly interested in whether continued waning of enthusiasm would trigger a hard data response, implying that the hard\u2013soft data disconnect is asymmetric.  I couldn\u2019t find one director or report of a firm actually changing their current business or investment plans.  Mydirectors argued that deteriorating sentiment is not likely to have too much of a downside consequence, in large part because businesses have yet to incorporate changes in government policy into their business plans in the first place.  I gather that this has been the pattern in anecdotal reports since the November election. I have to confess that I am a bit less sanguine about the potential for a negative shock.  There is considerable evidence that people have a heightened sensitivity to potential negative outcomes, and I can envision a scenario similar to the Tealbook\u2019s \u201cBroad Policy Disappointment\u201d scenario should the fiscal and regulatory changes that businesses are hoping for not come to pass.  As an aside, I do think there is also some value in distinguishing between fiscal changes and other regulatory changes that might take place.  I think that the probability of those is not the same, so we might incorporate that into our models. Following my predecessors in Atlanta, I have not incorporated any material changes in fiscal or other government policies into my forecast.  My growth forecast implies roughly 2 percent growth throughout the forecast horizon. Although there remains some, albeit diminishing, upside risk associated with the possibility of expansionary fiscal and regulatory policies, I do consider the Tealbook\u2019s \u201cBroad Policy Disappointment\u201d scenario to be a material countervailing downside risk. On prices, while I expect inflation to converge to the Committee\u2019s target by the end of next year, the recent weakness in the retail price data is concerning.  As I see it, it is possible to tie some of the recent softness to the outsized price declines in a few components, as was noted by Stacey earlier, but not all of the softness, I believe, can be attributed to this. With resource gaps that appear to be closed or closing, tightening labor markets, and a recent reversal in import prices, long-run inflation expectations should be emerging as the dominant determinant of inflation dynamics. For the time being, I accept that they are well anchored at the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective.  The readings received from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s business inflation expectation survey and market-based expectations calculations support this conclusion. However, with five straight years of core inflation underperforming the target and headline PCE inflation averaging just 1.6 percent over the balance of the recovery, I worry about the possibility of erosion in our nominal anchor. Nonetheless, while I am concerned, I am maintaining the view that the risks to the inflation outlook are roughly balanced.  However, an accumulation of soft reports\u2014and I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t see a continuation tomorrow with the May CPI release\u2014would lead me to reconsider my priors. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Fischer", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for this meeting.  Current economic conditions and my forecast for the economy are consistent with tighter policy. Perhaps more important is how monetary policy is described in the press conference and in the Monetary Policy Report testimony. My own view is that we should be laying the groundwork for moving this July to begin the gradual reduction in the balance sheet.  While I\u2019m very supportive of the balance sheet shrinking very gradually and remaining in the background, current conditions in my forecast indicate that we should not delay that process.  The costs of moving earlier than some expect need to be weighed against the costs of significantly undershooting sustainable unemployment rates by waiting too long.  Delaying past July an announcement of balance sheet actions could unduly complicate our normalization process, in view of the uncertainty about the debt ceiling, budget talks, and the appointment of new Federal Reserve Governors this fall. While I certainly do not believe in rigid monetary policy rules, I do believe that, as a rule of thumb, policy rules can be instructive in challenging why policy is deviating from simple historical norms.  All of the simple policy rules described in the Tealbook imply a tightening of policy that includes more than just three 25 basis point federal funds rate increases this year. It\u2019s important to note that none of these policy rules incorporate the sizable balance sheet, which, if  taken into account, implies an even larger increase than these policy rules prescribe. Even more strikingly, the Tealbook\u2019s optimal control simulations highlight the risk that the federal funds rate would need to be much higher, particularly if unemployment and inflation deviations are equally weighted in the loss function. Unless actual data come in substantially weaker than is forecast in the Tealbook, I would not be supportive of any pause in the gradual increase in the federal funds rate when we decide to make our balance sheet announcement.  In fact, if the data evolve consistent with the Tealbook, a strong case could be made for even tighter policy this year and next than the policy assumption used in the Tealbook.  If we want to continue moving policy gradually and to minimize the risk of an unsustainable overshooting that could unravel a sustainable recovery, we should continue with the regular normalization process of the federal funds rate while beginning the gradual reduction in our balance sheet sooner rather than later. In view of the apparent limited effects of our previous federal funds rate increases to date, as indicated by the numerous financial conditions indexes, and the increasing probability of substantially undershooting the natural rate of unemployment, continuing our funds rate increases as we begin to shrink our balance sheet may be the least risky path for avoiding, or at least delaying, the next recession.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bostic", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B and the proposed language change that you\u2019ve offered.  Today\u2019s decision continues the very gradual adjustment of short-term rates, which remain supportive of the economy\u2019s sustained growth, and it clarifies the Committee\u2019s approach to balance sheet reduction. The details of this plan, along with today\u2019s press conference, offer an important opportunity to explain the Committee\u2019s thinking about the balance sheet, and we will learn how markets react.  Assuming no change in the outlook, I believe we should consider implementing this plan as early as the July meeting, having laid the groundwork for a very modest and cautious pace of reduction. Research by my staff estimates that a $675 billion reduction in the balance sheet over two years is equivalent to only a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate.  In addition, this equivalent increase is likely to happen only gradually as we normalize and, in fact, may already be partially priced in by markets as they anticipate us ceasing reinvestments. Finally, I support the aim to bring inflation back to 2 percent in a sustainable manner, regardless of whether we are above or below our symmetric inflation target.  However, I remain skeptical regarding any policy choices that would deliberately target an undershoot of the unemployment rate or an overshoot of our 2 percent inflation target in order to make up for past misses.  I understand the risk of continued inflation below target, including lower inflation expectations.  But the greater risk, in my view, is trying to fine-tune our policy. If we wait for actual inflation at or above target, we risk having to raise rates more quickly, which could  undermine financial stability and defeat the sustained growth we seek in the long run. I view this outcome as far more costly for the economy than inflation running only slightly less than 2 percent for an extended time, especially when the unemployment rate is well below most estimates of the natural rate, including the median SEP value for the long-run unemployment rate. Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari", " MS. BRAINARD.  Conditions in the U.S. labor market continue to improve at a gradually diminishing pace.  With synchronized global growth for the first time in several years and the balance of risks from abroad improving, and with financial conditions easing further, on balance, I anticipate the U.S. economy will continue to strengthen in coming months.  For these reasons, I support an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate today. Nonetheless, there is a puzzling tension between signs that the economy is in the neighborhood of full employment and signs that the tentative progress we had seen on inflation is slowing.  The staff anticipates that the May reading on core PCE inflation was only 1.4 percent, if I got that right, little changed from the preceding year and continuing an eight-year run of inflation that remains stubbornly below target. The staff Tealbook forecasts that by the end of this year, core inflation will be only 1.6 percent, no better than last year.  And the May reading on the CPI didn\u2019t provide any reassurance on this front, although it\u2019s still hard to draw any firm conclusions. As I noted yesterday, I am concerned about the Committee\u2019s ability to guide inflation up to target after five years of downside misses.  While I remain hopeful that inflation will increase, the continued softness in the CPI \u201cprint\u201d this morning suggests a heightened risk that inflation will remain low. As a means of reflecting that risk, I support the Chair\u2019s proposed amendment, which would highlight that we will be monitoring inflation developments closely.  If the tension between the progress on employment and the lack of progress on inflation persists, it may lead me to reassess the expected path of the funds rate in the future, although I am not in a position to make that call today. As we move the target range for the federal funds rate higher, we can consider normalization of the federal funds rate to be \u201cwell under way,\u201d and if the economy evolves in line with the Summary of Economic Projections\u2019 median path, it will set the stage for a gradual and predictable running-off of the balance sheet. We\u2019ll have substantially more information in hand at our September meeting.  If that information confirms that we are on track, there\u2019s a compelling case to announce at the September meeting our intention to begin the reduction of reinvestment after risks surrounding the debt limit have been satisfactorily addressed, which could be at the beginning of November.  There will be a press conference following the September meeting, which would give the Chair an important opportunity to explain the decision and how it will be operationalized and evolve over time.  I view this step as a big deal and worth highlighting in a press conference as well as communications by the Chair in advance. I see no economic advantage to moving up the decision to July and substantial risk that it would trigger substantial unnecessary speculation that the FOMC reaction function had somehow changed for some unspoken reason. Moving in September will also give us an opportunity to assess the effects of the shift in reinvestment policy on financial markets and conditions before making our next move on short-term interest rates. While the announcement will have been extremely well communicated in advance and, thus, should not lead to any outsized moves in financial markets, it\u2019s also likely that that risk, small though it may be, is all on the same side.And, finally, by making the balance sheet announcement in September, it will give us more time to assess the inflation situation and financial conditions before we need to make the next decision on the federal funds rate.  The staff anticipates that core inflation will pick up in the second half of the year.  And it would be valuable to see the data confirming this forecast, as this would provide a very benign environment in which to continue on the gradual path of tightening currently envisaged in the SEP.  Similarly, but on the other side, it will be important to see whether there is, in fact, the expected tightening effect on longer-term yields, which we haven\u2019t seen so far, in order to calibrate that path appropriately.

We\u2019re sticking with the framework that we set up several years ago, although, in retrospect, maybe this is one area we would have chosen something with a little less of a deep association with danger and so forth", " MR. LEHNERT.  Yes", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My comments focus on the vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector as well as maturity and liquidity transformation risk.  Although the staff shading of these vulnerabilities is unchanged from the previous report, my own sense is that the foundation for these assessments could be shifting in ways that bear close monitoring. Recent estimates of the economy\u2019s ability to withstand a significant negative shock to the financial system are reliant on the current quantity and quality of capital held by the U.S. banking system.  Indeed, this most recent QS report cites bank capital positions as a key factor for the current low risk assessment of financial-sector leverage.  Since the previous QS report, however, there\u2019s been continued pressure from the industry to reduce capital requirements, and the potential for regulatory accommodation of lower requirements has surfaced.  And with the release of the CCAR results last month, the largest banks have announced plans to pay out substantially higher fractions of their earnings over the next year, and investors expect that to continue. Research suggests that after the transition to higher capital requirements, better-capitalized banks experience lower debt funding costs and faster loan growth.  These dynamics should lead to greater economic growth and more effective monetary policy transmission.  We should expect that a well-capitalized banking system that can withstand shocks accrues longer- term economic benefits in the form of a less severe and, therefore, less costly financial crises.  Because of that, we should be mindful that if current efforts to reduce existing capital stocks are successful, the financial stability outlook could deteriorate. Regarding vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation, I continue to hear from our insurance contacts in the region about pressures on their traditional business model that have led to new strategies.  For example, nontraditional liabilities and securities lending at insurance companies continues to increase, marking one area of concern.  This movement away from longer-term, stable sources of funding to greater reliance on short-term and alternative funding instruments, including those offered by Federal Home Loan Banks, should be carefully monitored.  Indeed, maturity transformation risk appears to be migrating from money markets to the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Eighth District contacts continue to report business conditions consistent with steady growth.  Some businesses that have a significant international presence are reporting 2017 results somewhat above expectations as they stood earlier this year, but other businesses that are more or possibly exclusively domestically based are reporting only a modest rebound after a slow start to the year.  The District agribusiness sector remains weak, and that sector is not expected to improve meaningfully this year.  The District unemployment rate is 4.0 percent based on the latest reading, well below the national average.  Nevertheless, District price pressures remain moderate overall. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of St", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for today, with a few caveats.  I think, generally speaking, the Committee is in fairly good shape for now.  I am supportive of going ahead with ending reinvestment in September, provided there are no large surprises on the economy.  I do support, accordingly, the blue language in paragraph 5\u2014both the \u201cFor the time being\u201d language and the \u201crelatively soon\u201d language. I remain doubtful that we need to plan for preemptive moves on the policy rate in order to meet our policy goals over the forecast horizon.  As of today, it appears unlikely that the inflation situation will change markedly by the end of the year.  And on this dimension, I support  President Bostic\u2019s suggestion to use paragraph 3 of alternative A instead of the way it\u2019s written in alternative B.  I think that\u2019s a good idea.  President Evans commented on that as well.  I think that\u2019s something to consider.  The Committee, in my view, will likely be on pause through the end of the year and into 2018, based on the inflation situation. I\u2019d like to reiterate to the Committee that the U.S. price level has fallen about 4.5 percent off the price-level path established between 1995 and 2012.  If you draw a line through the price level from 1995 to 2012, it\u2019s about 2 percent.  But we\u2019ve fallen off that path since then, and that looks likely to get worse as we go through the end of the year.  That suggests to me that the future might call for a reassessment of U.S. monetary policy strategy along the lines of price-level or nominal GDP targeting, as was discussed by the staff in the Tealbook.  If we were going to do something like that, that would be a major change in strategy, but it may be time that we start thinking about that more carefully. Barring a major change in strategy, I think our approach as we go forward should be to move to a description of the current level of the policy rate as appropriate for today, and that the current level of the policy rate may remain appropriate over the forecast horizon, barring large changes to the U.S. economy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with both amendments to paragraph 5.  I believe we should announce the start of the wind-down of our balance sheet in the September meeting, and I think this new language sets us up more clearly to communicate that.  Regarding President Bostic\u2019s suggestion, for myself, I\u2019m at least one meeting away from being ready to adopt that language.  I\u2019d like to see more data over the next couple or  three months before we adopt the language in paragraph 3, alternative A.  I might get there eventually, though. Regarding further increases in the federal funds rate, I intend to be patient and await further information that confirms we\u2019re continuing to make progress toward meeting our 2 percent inflation objective.  I do believe the cyclical forces are tilted to creating inflation pressure.  However, I also believe that the secular forces are powerful and are likely muting inflation pressures, so I intend to observe closely how these forces unfold. I\u2019m struggling with a dilemma, which I\u2019ve talked to a number of you about, and I\u2019ll just mention it.  On the cyclical side, pressures are building.  There\u2019s no doubt the labor market is tightening.  I think it is leading to growing labor shortages, and I think, on a like-for-like basis, it\u2019s leading to wage pressure, if you carve out the compositional factors that we talked about yesterday.  These forces are certainly susceptible to monetary policy\u2014that is, a higher federal funds rate would tamp this down.  On the other hand, my strong view is that the secular or structural forces are very powerful, and, in my view, they\u2019re intensifying.  Technology-enabled disruption is intensifying, and the effects of globalization, to a lesser extent, are also strong.  These are leading to a loss of pricing power\u2014which is widespread, in my view\u2014and a muting of inflation pressures.  These secular forces are not so easy to measure.  They\u2019re also not particularly susceptible to influence by monetary policy. So as we look ahead, one scenario would be, if we allow the cyclical pressures to build because we\u2019re not meeting our inflation target, businesses will face more labor shortages.  That should lead to more wage pressure and should lead to margin erosion.  To reduce these pressures, businesses will do what they\u2019re doing now:  They will step up their investment in technology to reduce the reliance on workers and to lower their costs.  This cycle may not be all bad, but I\u2019m  not sure.  Low interest rates may also lead to other unhealthy imbalances building in financial markets, ultimately leading to growing risks that may be difficult to unwind and prudently manage.  And at a certain point, I think, this could be dangerous, particularly if we don\u2019t maintain and keep strong macroprudential policies. So, what I\u2019m talking about with my team and others around this table is, first, do you agree with this cyclical versus secular dilemma.  I don\u2019t think everyone does, but I think it\u2019s worth debating.  And, second, if you do agree with this dilemma, how should we be thinking about it from a policy point of view.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George"], "2017FOMC20170920meeting.txt": [" MR. KAMIN.  Right.  My intended argument was, in some sense, the opposite of that, which was that the Taylor rule takes into account the rate of core inflation and the output gap as it\u2019s currently estimated, but it does not incorporate considerations of the headwinds that might be temporarily pushing down on r*, which was the point of showing some estimates in panel 9.  The actual cyclical r* could be much less than is incorporated into the Taylor rule.  That\u2019s one issue.  Another issue is that it does not take into account any temporary or not-so-temporary factors that might be obstructing the transmission channel going from economic growth to slack in the labor market to wages and to inflation.  And as long as central bankers are both very concerned about the possibility of headwinds depressing cyclical r*, as long as they are also concerned about their inability to identify longer-run r*, and as long as they have concerns about how well the transmission channels are operating through the labor markets, that might well stay their hand and lead them to be more patient in raising rates than would be indicated by the rule", " MR. KASHKARI.  Do you have any explanation", " MR. WILCOX.  Just very briefly:  Steve mentioned the recognition that we are not alone in the global economy in having low inflation.  We wouldn\u2019t have been inclined to write off our low inflation experience anyway, but it makes us even more cautious or hesitant about doing that.  I think there are some common explanations.  I\u2019m much less familiar with the international data than Steve is, but productivity growth, I believe, is a phenomenon with considerable global effect\u2014lots of economies around the world have been experiencing slow growth of productivity over a protracted period of time.  And I think some of the explanations that President Kaplan has been highlighting in his recent interventions also have commonality across many different countries, with technology-enabled disruption and perhaps heightened competition undermining  the pricing power of firms.  We don\u2019t have a great set of diagnostics or explanations for that.  There are some phenomena that seem, at least prima facie anyway, at odds with that, but the commonality, I\u2019d say, is worrisome", " MR. POTTER.  I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be that surprised.  There\u2019s some commentary around the longer-run estimate.  There\u2019s a lot of work by various people that they know that we look at, and that\u2019s been coming down.  I think there were some people who thought that.  I don\u2019t think people in the market necessarily focus a lot on the 2020 dot relative to the long run.  I think the long run probably has more information for market participants than the estimate for 2020, which is about a percentage point or more above the market estimate", "  MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The incoming data continue to show an economy expanding at a moderate but above-trend pace, with job growth easily strong enough to drive measures of unemployment lower.  Despite rising resource utilization, there is little evidence that wage pressures are building this year or that inflation is moving up to our 2 percent objective.  But with supportive financial conditions still in place, the recent data leave my overall narrative for the economy little changed from the previous SEP\u2014in fact, little changed from a year ago, although I am now a bit less confident that inflation is moving up. Real GDP growth averaged 2.3 percent in the first half, and I expect it to continue broadly on that path, with a strengthening in business investment and a swing in the contribution of net exports from being a moderate drag to being a modestly positive factor this year.  I expect similar outcomes over the rest of this year, as the recent performance seems to be based on solid fundamentals.  The staff\u2019s estimate of the effects of the twin hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, has been evolving, as is appropriate.  The estimate now is that the hit to Q3 growth will be in the range of 1 full percentage point, but that growth will snap back by fourth quarter.  That sounds right, although it does seem to me that there is some risk that the full snapback may extend over another quarter or two. Above-trend growth continues to tighten labor market conditions, with a falling unemployment rate and a rising demographically adjusted labor force participation rate.  Since October 2013, the participation rate has oscillated around 62.8 percent as the estimated 0.2 percentage point annual decline arising from aging has been offset by rising prime-age participation.  Prime-age participation has recovered to 81 percent, still 1 percentage point below its level in 2007, which suggests there may still be some room for further recovery there.  I do expect participation to continue to move sideways for a while longer as the healthy job market  continues to draw in more workers and more of the recession-induced labor market scarring is healed.  Even with this increase in participation relative to trend, I see the unemployment rate reaching the low 4s by the end of this year and into the high 3s next year and remaining there for some time, materially below common estimates of the natural rate, including my own estimate of 4.5 percent. A tightening labor market should mean a gradual acceleration in wages and prices.  So far, that is not in the data, with most measures of nominal wage growth showing no signs of acceleration over the past year.  And while 2\u00bd percent wage growth is in keeping with the underlying fundamentals of inflation and very low productivity growth, the lack of acceleration in wages is surprising if, in fact, we are at or below the natural rate.  This brings me to the unexpected weakness in inflation, for which there is not yet a clear or satisfactory explanation.  After running close to 2 percent for 2016, core PCE prices increased only 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and it may be that we will not see a material increase from that level until well into 2018. There are several plausible explanations, as has been well covered around the table.  First, transient factors may be pushing down aggregate inflation just as transient factors pushed it up last year.  And, like it sounds many around the table have done, I have studied this evidence carefully, hoping to find a clear answer there, but I find the evidence to be ambiguous.  So we\u2019ll have to wait and see.  Second, it may be either that there is more domestic slack, as I mentioned with respect to the labor market, or perhaps that in some sense global slack somehow overhangs wage- and price-setting in the United States and other advanced economies, as I think Steve Kamin was suggesting earlier.  Third, the Phillips curve may be even flatter than we think.  Finally, and most troubling, it may be that underlying trend inflation and inflation expectations have moved down after years of inflation below the 2 percent objective.  Looking across various estimates of inflation expectations received from surveys and markets, I see mixed evidence on this.  Conditional on achieving something like the Tealbook forecast for real activity, which is to say, three consecutive years in 2018, 2019, and 2020 of unemployment below 4 percent, I continue to think that the inflation shortfall should disappear over that time.  If that doesn\u2019t do it, then it\u2019s hard to know what would.  Of course, we don\u2019t know that.  And, of course, if trend has declined, that would have significant implications for the conduct of policy.  For now, in my view, we have the flexibility to be patient, and there is a strong case for continuing to do so. And, Madam Chair, I will close by joining others in thanking Stan Fischer for the privilege, and also the pleasure, of being his colleague for these years.  Thank you, Stan", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Madam Chair, can I ask a question.  Thomas, what you\u2019re pointing out\u2014I think I\u2019m reading this right\u2014is that if people actually think that r* is rising over time, the decline in the unemployment rate that we\u2019re showing in the forecast is inconsistent with that. CHAIR YELLEN.  It should be faster than people think it\u2019s going to decline", "  Yes, that was the one that I mentioned, that generates this\u2014 MR. WILCOX.  \u2014having inflation expectations become unanchored, more dependent on past performance.  If you get a positive shock, and then that\u2019s allowed to feed on itself and spiral  upward.  Those are the kinds of things that we need to do in order to generate higher inflation in the model", " MR. EVANS.  Or is it just going to maybe 2\u00bd percent, in which case I think we need to have a better discussion of what we mean by \u201csymmetry\u201d as a Committee.  That would be informative", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I think you\u2019d have to speculate.  I think to do that you\u2019d have to have the kind of analysis in which you go back and you have different regimes, different states of the world, and you say, \u201cOh, what would it be like in a 1970s state of the world", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with the changes you suggested.  It is time to begin balance sheet normalization.  But when the time comes for our next increase in the federal funds rate, we should be confident that inflation is indeed moving up toward our symmetric 2 percent objective. I think the statement sets the table well for our December decision point.  For me, this will hinge on whether the inflation outlook solidifies enough to justify another increase in rates or whether the downside risks to inflation continue to dominate and thus dictate delaying the next move. In my view, the descriptions of inflation in the statement lay out the recent facts well and give appropriate weight to concerns about the downside risks.  I have to say, however, that given where things stand now, I don\u2019t expect to see enough evidence by December to justify a rate increase.  The current soft underlying inflation trend just seems too entrenched, and the uncertainties are too large and too one sided.  My SEP submission has no additional rate hike this year.  I do expect three rate increases in each of the next two years.  I also expect the Cubs to repeat as World Series champions before I retire.  [Laughter]  This puts the funds rate at the end of 2019 at 2\u00be percent, which is my new assumed level for the longer-run neutral rate.  My SEP leaves the funds rate at neutral in 2020 even though, by the end of that year, we project inflation will be 2 percent.  At 3.9 percent, the unemployment rate will be about one-half percentage point below the natural rate. This configuration is obviously not a rest point, but it doesn\u2019t cause me a great deal of angst, either.  Under this scenario, inflation probably would increase modestly above 2 percent in 2021.  But given the flat Phillips curve, the amount of resource pressure we envision, by itself, is not going to generate a great deal of inflation overshooting.  Instead, such an outcome may be what is needed to solidify inflation expectations symmetrically at 2 percent, which is an important foundation for achieving our inflation objective.  Unless we\u2019re willing to signal that we can accept a reasonable chance of such outcomes, I don\u2019t see how inflation will ever get back to target.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", "  MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I prefer alternative A but can support alternative B.  I actually had the same comment that President Bullard had about the language in paragraph 4, preferring not to make the reference to \u201cgradual increases in the federal funds rate.\u201d I continue to monitor inflation, inflation expectations, and the unemployment rate, looking for signs that the labor force participation story is running to its conclusion.  Right now, I\u2019m mostly focused on inflation, where we are far from target.  As we\u2019ve discussed, core inflation is low at 1.4 percent.  It\u2019s been persistently low for six months, and it does not appear to be transitory, especially given low global inflation, which we discussed yesterday. My view is that low inflation reflects a mix of remaining slack coupled with low inflation expectations.  Given this diagnosis, I think it is appropriate policy at this point to remain accommodative until inflation returns to target.  In my view, we should hold off on any further increases in the federal funds rate until we\u2019ve reached our inflation goal of core PCE at 2.0 percent on a 12-month basis unless we see a large further decline in the headline unemployment rate, suggesting that slack has been used up, or evidence of inflation expectations starting to drift higher, which we\u2019re not seeing right now. To me, maintaining accommodation will support economic growth, which will help reduce slack, which will eventually increase wage and inflation pressures.  Signaling a firm commitment to our symmetric inflation target will also help support inflation expectations.  If we instead\u2014this is about the language\u2014continue to signal that the federal funds rate is on a gradual upward path, I fear that inflation will continue to drift sideways and we risk expectations becoming unanchored downward. At the previous meeting, I mentioned I was trying to rethink how I was approaching the SEP, and I tried my best not to rely on the Phillips curve.  But I couldn\u2019t get there.  At the end of  the day, I do believe that a tight labor market eventually should lead to higher wages and higher inflation.  So, what I\u2019ve done\u2014I\u2019m SEP submission number 5\u2014I have no increase in the federal funds rate this year or next year until I reach some view that slack is being used up.  That is sometime in 2019. Finally, I do support starting our plan for balance sheet normalization in October.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard", " MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, I appreciate your comments, and I think if I was in your chair, I would agree with that.  [Laughter]  But I\u2019m not.  I think that I would like the Committee to think about this, especially Governor Brainard\u2019s comments about where r* is, how fast do you think r* is going back, and how close are we to r* right now.  I think there was a time when this language was put in where we thought that the policy rate was quite a bit below r*, and, therefore, we said that this gap has got to be gradually closed.  But since then, President Williams and Thomas Laubach have convinced us that r* is quite a bit lower than we thought, plus we\u2019ve raised the rate.  This gap has become pretty low, and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s really  appropriate now to continue to say that we\u2019ve got a long path of gradual rate hikes.  I agree about your SEP comment, though. CHAIR YELLEN.   From my own standpoint, point well taken, and I think I agree also with what the Vice Chairman said, which is, this isn\u2019t language I would propose to put in today if it wasn\u2019t already there.  I do think it\u2019s worth a rethink at an appropriate time, especially if we determine in light of data that a more gradual path than we\u2019re anticipating\u2014in light of inflation data, perhaps\u2014becomes what we expect.  I do think it\u2019s something we should rethink, but I wouldn\u2019t want to make the change today.  And if anyone wants to express support, please do.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, then let me ask Brian to call the roll", "  [Show of hands] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You had to have some controversy"], "2017FOMC20171101meeting.txt": [" MR. ROSENGREN.  My question is on financial stability.  And thank you for the briefing memos that you provided before the meeting.  My question actually wasn\u2019t in what you just presented, so I hope it won\u2019t be an unfair question, but one of the charts that you had in that packet was a chart that showed the ratio of commercial real estate to total assets\u2014it\u2019s chart 24 in the memo \u201cCRE from an institutions perspective.\u201d  And what it showed was that if you look at the 25 largest banks, it\u2019s basically been flat\u2014in other words, it hasn\u2019t been a big deal for the largest banks.  That\u2019s quite consistent with stress tests that are quite severe, discouraging large banks from holding a lot of commercial real estate.  The chart also had a second line for banks that were not in the top 25\u2014and for those banks, the ratio has gone from 15 percent to 23 percent.  Their CRE assets are roughly $1.4 trillion. October 31\u2013 So the overall sense I got from reading the memo was that you weren\u2019t particularly worried about commercial real estate.  And the question that came to my mind was, if you have widespread failure of small institutions, can that be a financial stability problem, or in the way staff is defining financial stability, can it only be a financial stability problem if it\u2019s one of the largest banks.  So to what extent can an aggregation of small banks that are leveraged be a financial stability problem or, at least in the staff\u2019s view, do you only view it as a large bank issue", " MR. COVITZ.  I think we don\u2019t view financial stability just as a large bank issue.  We do think, if there are a sufficient number of small banks that are leveraged, yes, that would constitute a concern.  I think we do have to somehow try to aggregate up the amount of leverage in the financial system.  So if you aggregate up the small banks that you think you have exposures to and it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a big enough piece of the overall system, then we might make a judgment that the leverage in the overall financial system isn\u2019t particularly high.  But I think we absolutely do consider their leverage just as much as the leverage of other institutions", " MR. LEBOW.  That\u2019s right.  That\u2019s consistent with many purely statistical univariate models of inflation that estimate an underlying trend that is lower than 2 percent, maybe in the neighborhood of 1.5.  So this model is, I think, fairly consistent with that. Now, as far as assumptions about this trend in the future are concerned, we have for some time been assuming that this trend would eventually start to move up toward 2 percent.  I think it was starting around three years ago\u2014I went back and looked in our Tealbook projections\u2014that we started saying that 2018 was about the time we would start to see a movement up. So where does that come from.  At the most conceptual level, it\u2019s the view that this Committee ultimately determines where inflation is in the economy.  But just saying that doesn\u2019t tell you over what time period, nor what exactly is the mechanism that brings that about.  But what has been underlying our projection is the idea that when the labor market reaches a certain degree of tightness, we would start to see inflation moving up, and that would be about the time we would start to see some upward drift in inflation expectations that would help push this underlying trend higher. So here we are now approaching 2018.  We are seeing the tighter labor market, but inflation has been surprisingly low, and we characterize measures of inflation expectations as mostly remaining stable\u2014if anything, a little bit lower, not higher. So it\u2019s safe to say, I\u2019m a little nervous about this projection of the trend moving forward.  It\u2019s worth one-tenth over the next three years.  That\u2019s how much it adds to our inflation projection.  The fact that we took down our inflation projection a little bit, that we carried October 31\u2013 forward a little bit of the downward surprise into next year, could be viewed as a signal that we\u2019re a little nervous about this trend.  Obviously, it\u2019s possible that this could be something more persistent, in which case you might say, \u201cWell, a more persistent weakness would be consistent with a lower trend than we have", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is for Beth Anne Wilson.  I\u2019m looking at page 10, \u201cOther International Risks:  International Financial Stability Matrix.\u201d  I just want to make sure I understand the new, \u201cProminence of Risks\u201d column.  I know we talked about this last time, about how South Korea would get low marks on the assessment for October.  But then we go to the new column, and they have \u201cHigh,\u201d and you\u2019re attributing that to tensions on the Korean peninsula.  How should I understand the \u201cLow\u201d for South Korea and then the \u201cHigh,\u201d and maybe some of the others with \u201cHigh\u201d in the \u201cProminence of Risks\u201d column", " MS. WILSON.  Right", " MR. BULLARD.  And so am I correct then for the United Kingdom, the \u201cHigh\u201d mark in the \u201cProminence of Risks\u201d column is due to the Brexit situation", " MS. WILSON.  Italy has very weak growth.  Its banking sector continues to be extremely vulnerable.  It\u2019s not profitable, and it has high levels of nonperforming loans and sovereign debt.  So there are a number of developments that make Italy \u201cNotable\u201d in terms of its assessment of vulnerabilities.  And on top of that, you do have political stresses with upcoming elections, with a rise of sort of anti-EU parties, and we wanted to have a place at which we could note that there are some proximate risks coming from Italy that actually increase our assessment of its vulnerability", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019m going to talk a little bit about commercial real estate again.  I thought the staff did a very nice job with the memos they October 31\u2013 provided.  They highlighted that valuations are high and that exposure on the part of large banks has not grown particularly.  But looking at the same set of charts, I come to a different conclusion, and I thought it was useful to provide an alternative viewpoint, to respectfully disagree with where the Board staff comes out. So my definition actually is quite similar to the definition that was provided for financial instability.  It\u2019s any situation in which loan supply is interrupted to the extent that the intermediation process is significantly disrupted and the real economy is significantly affected. By my definition, the credit-crunch period in the late 1980s was an episode of financial instability.  While credit from small and mid-sized banks with large exposures to real estate was the source of the disruption\u2014not credit from the largest banks\u2014the disruption was large enough to have macroeconomic consequences.  The reduction in credit supply originating in small and medium-sized institutions was a large part of the headwinds in monetary policy that Chairman Greenspan highlighted during that period.  As of 1989, quarter 3, banks outside the top 25 institutions had 15 percent of their assets in commercial real estate loans, and the CRE capitalization rate was 7.9 percent.  By 1992, the capitalization rate had risen to 9.5 percent, as CRE prices fell faster than rents, and 1,025 banks and savings and loans had failed.  I attended hearings all over New England at that time listening to borrowers unable to get credit.  As of 2006, quarter 4, banks outside the top 25 institutions held 23 percent of their assets in commercial real estate loans at an average CRE cap rate of 7 percent.  By 2010, 338 institutions had failed, and the cap rate had risen to 8.6 percent.  Another 185 institutions failed in the subsequent four years. Because of the failures of the largest financial institutions, the failures of these smaller institutions received less attention but were, nonetheless, amplifying the problems.  Today banks October 31\u2013 outside the top 25 institutions hold 23 percent of their assets in real estate loans, with average cap rates of 6.1 percent.  Compared with the two previous periods of financial instability, this CRE exposure is in line with or higher, and the cap rates are quite a bit lower. What simulation would I want to see to determine whether all of this is a benign development.  Consider a simulation that has commercial real estate prices fall, as in the previous CCAR, coupled with a significant recession.  Add the assumption that falling commercial real estate prices motivate the GSEs to no longer provide support for commercial real estate\u2014specifically, the multifamily segment\u2014as their losses mount and as we know they have no capital cushion.  Assume we need to lower the funds rate to its effective lower bound, which collapses net interest margins for all banks. In such a scenario, loans outside of commercial real estate are quite likely to be stressed as well, and it is likely that wholesale funding will dry up.  Because many large banks and fintech firms rely on such funding, I am skeptical that these lenders will find lending into a collapsing market attractive at other than fire-sale prices. In the scenario that I\u2019m envisioning, we would simulate the effect on bank failures, the regional pattern of failures, and the response of banks to diminished capital ratios that likely encourage them to shrink.  We would then estimate the effect of this financial problem on the real economy. My concern is that, indeed, overall credit intermediation would be disrupted, with significant deterioration of the real economy.  Note also that the Federal Reserve\u2019s reputation as a steward of the economy and a bank supervisor might well suffer as collateral damage during such an event.  If this simulation shows that exposure at small and medium-sized banks poses a October 31\u2013 serious risk, including risks to the real economy, we should find additional ways to address this issue.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Just one question on your additional considerations and in order to get a little more of your view of whether undershooting unemployment is less costly than overshooting.  Clearly, there\u2019s a benefit because you bring people who are more marginally attached to the labor force back in, but how do you think about the financial stability risks.  So, pushing the labor market very tight, you\u2019ll probably hit your inflation target more quickly.  Has the staff done work to think about periods when the unemployment rate gets below 4 percent\u2014 what is the likelihood of having a financial stability problem. That would get at some of those costs.  So if you think of it only in terms of unemployment and inflation, there\u2019s really not much cost.  But if you add the financial stability October 31\u2013 element, it\u2019s really thinking about a Taylor rule in a much more dynamic sense of, how likely is pushing beyond a sustainable rate likely to cause a very high unemployment rate in the future.  I don\u2019t know what your thoughts are on that.  And we normally don\u2019t have a lot of discussion about financial stability in this part, but I think, considering the Tealbook\u2019s forecast of 3.6 percent, which is getting much further below the u* that the staff is currently using\u2014what is your view of what the costs are of pushing the economy to be that tight", " MR. KAPLAN.  It makes sense to me that we have a good grip on what\u2019s going on with business debt.  We have a good grip on what\u2019s going on in the household sector.  I guess my thinking is a little bit colored by the recent past of whatever the number was, $70 trillion to $90 trillion of CDS, which were not easy to see.  I\u2019m wondering particularly about derivatives or margin debt or other excesses in the shadow banking system.  I gather\u2014and this is a question:  How confident are we that we have good visibility as to what\u2019s going on there", " MR. QUARLES.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I support your suggested approach on paragraph 5.  I do think that taking it out in December is the right thing.  If you leave it in as boilerplate, it will require thinking about whether anything that\u2019s happened requires fiddling with that language, and it\u2019s best simply to have made clear that it\u2019s \u201cturtles all the way down\u201d from December. I am comfortable with the market\u2019s expectations that this body is likely to move in December again.  I do think that, in light of the discussions around this table and the briefings by the staff, we have to ask ourselves how hard we\u2019re willing to push in order to move inflation a October 31\u2013 few tenths of a point if, for some reason, inflation settles to a level that\u2019s very slightly below our 2 percent goal.  I thought the staff\u2019s memo on uncertainty and misperceptions pointed to the risk of pushing too hard on inflation in the context of a flat Phillips curve and volatile and idiosyncratic shocks to inflation, and I think that\u2019s a risk that we should take seriously. All of that said, the advantage of being the new person is that you can wade into disputes that have been settled in the past without any knowledge of their history, and I thought that President Bullard\u2019s question yesterday as to why we had an SEP process that basically painted us into a corner for December each year was a sensible question.  While I\u2019m comfortable with the corner we painted ourselves into, I do support the idea that perhaps we should look into whether that\u2019s a wise practice.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Good suggestion.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", " October 31\u2013 MR. BOSTIC.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Good morning, everyone.  I support alternative B today, including the inclusion of the proposed language of paragraph 5, followed by the removal from the December policy statement coupled with a mention in the press conference. Looking to the December meeting, I am comfortable continuing on the path of a slow removal of accommodation, should the incoming data unfold in a manner consistent with the outlook I discussed yesterday.  However, with every passing inflation report that falls short, I am becoming more and more concerned that expectations may be keeping inflation from reaching our target.  Following the first quarter of 2012, the quarter in which the Committee formally announced the 2 percent longer-run target, the year-over-year growth rate in headline inflation has touched the target only once, in the first quarter of this year.  In my pre-Fed life, I always thought of the 2 percent inflation target as an objective designed to deliver a price level reasonably close to a 2 percent growth path over the medium term.  I still believe this is a good way to think about our inflation objective. It is striking to consider what the record looks like relative to an implicit 2 percent growth price-level target.  If such an objective had been implemented in 2012, we\u2019d currently find ourselves short of the desired price level by more than 4 percentage points.  For some context, we might go back to 1993, when the FOMC arguably began operating as if it had an implicit long-run inflation target of about 2 percent.  Before the past five years, the largest deviation from any 2 percent price-level path, during that time and before we introduced our inflation target in the first quarter of 2012, was, in absolute value, a little less than 3 percentage points. I worry about five-plus years of deviating on the low side of our target.  Even if one acknowledges that some weakness might have been expected coming out of the Great Recession, the path has not changed appreciably as we have approached full employment.  I worry about October 31\u2013 increasingly deviating from the underlying price-level path that I think is a good metric for whether we are successful in meeting our longer-term price-stability objective. Yesterday I noted I\u2019m still forecasting movement toward target as temporary effects of inflation dissipate.  But, like President Harker, President Evans, and Governor Brainard, I am concerned that we risk expectations becoming anchored below 2 percent if that forecast does not materialize. Although Governor Fischer is no longer with us on the Committee, it seems several of us, myself included, are taking up his mantle and playing \u201cStan for a Day.\u201d  We\u2019ve noted in the past that surveys and discussions with directors and business contacts suggest a large portion of the public believes 2 percent is a ceiling.  If we were to express our inflation target as the center of a range, with perhaps a \u00bd percentage point tolerance on either side of that midpoint, perhaps that would reinforce the idea that our tolerance for misses really is symmetric. Now, I realize that changing our objective to a target range is probably not in the cards at present, nor is the idea of a more explicit price-level objective, although President Evans, President Williams, and others have usefully joined in such a discussion in the past.  But I think it would be useful at some point to revisit how we formulate and communicate our objective, especially if evidence accumulates that inflation expectations have slipped away from us.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  With an economy growing above trend, low unemployment, and stable prices, a more neutral stance of monetary policy is warranted.  Following the balance sheet normalization action in September, I support alternative B, as it leaves open the door for the Committee to consider a move in December and can be viewed as October 31\u2013 consistent with the gradual approach emphasized in our communications, so long as economic conditions evolve in line with expectations. Although my policy rate path may differ, I, too, am mindful of the challenges we face in our narrative concerning low inflation readings and the longer-run 2 percent inflation target, which we chose in 2012 as a proxy for price stability.  However, in the context of the economy\u2019s ongoing performance and what I see as our ultimate objective, which is to promote maximum employment and price stability in a sustainable manner, I\u2019m wary of fine-tuning our interest rate policy to achieve and maintain precise numerical objectives for inflation and employment. We\u2019ve identified these numerical targets as longer-run benchmarks, and deviations from them, such as we see today, are to be expected.  When we\u2019re fortunate enough to be in a situation in which we\u2019re substantively achieving our dual-mandate objectives, monetary policy should be a neutral influence on the economy.  Yet the current funds rate target is well below the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value, thereby providing undue accommodation.  Nearly all of our benchmark policy rules echo this.  Accordingly, we should continue a gradual removal of this accommodation. In the medium term, we need to weigh deviations from our inflation objective against deviations from our employment objective.  In the current context, the shortfall of inflation below 2 percent should be weighed against the decline of unemployment below our estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.  Low inflation judged in the context of an economy operating at or beyond full employment and growing above trend should not cause us to unconditionally recalibrate our policy rate path. It seems to me that our current challenge is to communicate a course for monetary policy that balances the undershooting of the unemployment rate against these lower inflation readings.  October 31\u2013 With the unemployment rate falling below SEP estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, I\u2019d like to see the Committee recalibrate its communication regarding the aims of the current stance of policy.  Since September 2016, paragraph 3 of our statement has noted that the stance of policy remains accommodative to support some further strengthening in labor market conditions, in addition to supporting a return to 2 percent inflation.  Movements in inflation and the unemployment rate this year have been noncomplementary with respect to our longer-run objectives.  The Committee should, I think, follow a balanced approach in promoting its goals as described in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. In this respect, I think that, as soon as our next meeting, the current language in the statement may need to be refreshed in order to describe progress toward our goals more accurately.  To this end, I might suggest that the sentence that says \u201cthe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative\u201d should not focus on further strengthening in the labor market, but instead simply note that it is supporting a sustained return to 2 percent inflation at a time when the unemployment rate is running below its estimated longer-run level. Along these lines, I found the Board staff\u2019s memo on the uncertainty and misperceptions for monetary policy to be informative, and its assessment underlies my concern with the statement language in paragraph 3.  Because of the unresponsiveness of inflation to economic slack or the lack thereof, it may be the case that it would take an extreme overheating of the economy to generate a more rapid move of inflation back to 2 percent.  Such an overheating would likely cause further resource misallocation, threaten financial stability, and ultimately could hand us an undesirable increase in inflation or hasten the next recession. Finally, Madam Chair, I support your paragraph 5 approach\u2014leaving it in at this meeting and thinking about it at the next one. October 31\u2013 CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.

It could happen beyond 2020, and you\u2019re forecasting that.  I can\u2019t really tell what you think is optimal.  Is it to stay at 2 forever and then gradually\u2014inflation expectations get back to 2, or is it to go above 2, to get inflation expectations back to 2 more quickly.  I mean, there must be some cost of having inflation expectations below 2 for a longer period of time, right", " WILLIAMS.  6 of the 16 have overshoots.

And I am hopeful that\u2014I actually think that those survey expectations are pretty flat and that they do not really represent the true expectation.  And so that monetary  accommodation is going to push up those expectations.  How fast is uncertain, and this is kind of our baseline", " MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you.  Second question.  In the Tealbook there was a box, which I really appreciated, on the inverted yield curve in the staff baseline forecast and why it shouldn\u2019t be so concerning.  And it doesn\u2019t forecast recession even though, as we discussed last time, for four years we would\u2019ve been inverting the yield curve.  So I\u2019m skeptical that we wouldn\u2019t not trigger a recession in that scenario.  But I would also note that some of the arguments some folks around the table are making on why we should be raising rates now refer to the case in which the Phillips curve steepens all of a sudden.  But I would note, even in the alternative scenario in which the Phillips curve steepens all of a sudden, we also don\u2019t trigger a recession.  And so I\u2019m wondering how much confidence should we have in either of those situations, that neither an inverted yield curve for four years would cause a recession nor would responding to a steeper Phillips curve cause a recession.  My gut tells me that, probably, in both scenarios, it would trigger a recession.  And the question is, do we trigger the recession in advance or do we trigger the recession in reaction.  I\u2019m just curious how the staff would respond to that", " MR. WILCOX.  There is an aspect of our simulations that is what it is.  The models that we use to generate those simulations are well-behaved, nice linear models.  They don\u2019t have any special dynamics that take over when the economy is close to what is sometimes referred to as \u201cstall speed.\u201d  Dan Sichel, among many others, has studied the fact that dynamics seem to differ around recessions in ways that don\u2019t comport comfortably with tidy linear models that have nice Gaussian errors.  And that\u2019s not taken into account in the baseline projection.  In the baseline projection, we\u2019re employing a linear structure that presumes that smooth adjustment is possible. I think that, as John highlighted, you\u2019re definitely skirting closer to conditions that would be consistent with a recession, and so a smaller shock would be sufficient to tip you into\u2014if those nonlinear dynamics exist, a smaller shock would get you there, into that downward spiral that seems to characterize typical postwar recessions in the United States", " MR. KAPLAN.  I\u2019ll just make one comment, reacting to this simulation and the inverted yield curve.  Even though that\u2019s what your analysis shows, I guess that won\u2019t change that, as we\u2019re removing accommodation, if we get into a situation around the table here\u2014that you\u2019re forecasting we will or saying we will, which probably is true\u2014that we actually have an inverted yield curve, I assume we\u2019re going to have a\u2014we\u2019ll all reserve the right to have a healthy debate as to whether we want to let that happen.  I certainly will be one that will be initiating a healthy debate at the time as to whether that\u2019s the right thing, even though I understand that your analysis shows that we can have an inverted yield curve without causing a recession.  That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t.  I\u2019m just calling out that I\u2019ll probably be one of the ones around the table who will say, \u201cLet\u2019s have a very intense debate about that", " MR. KAPLAN.  And I guess one of the reasons I can imagine we\u2019ll have the debate is, what does it mean that the 10-year Treasury rate is at whatever level it is, such that it won\u2019t budge even though we think the economy is overheated.  Why isn\u2019t the 10-year rate sort of consistent with that.  And that probably will be a source of a lot of discussion. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Harker", " MR. HARKER.  Just a quick question, back to the tax legislation.  I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve done any sensitivity analysis on the point that President Evans brought up before on the state contingency.  I\u2019m more worried about the business fixed investment, and I say that because,  anecdotally, survey work\u2014there\u2019s no large firm in America, I believe, that\u2019s saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not investing because of the cost of capital.\u201d Now, there may be an issue about deductibility and related matters, right, and the expensing of capital, and it may be that small and medium-sized enterprises have some constraint.  But I don\u2019t hear anybody right now saying they\u2019re not investing because capital is too expensive.  And so it raises the issue of the elasticity that\u2019s assumed and whether you\u2019ve done any sensitivity analysis on that, because that drives, I would imagine, a fair amount of this growth.  And what we\u2019re assuming, and what I\u2019ve seen in multiple models\u2014our model, the Kent Smetters model at University of Pennsylvania, and so forth\u2014it doesn\u2019t jibe with what you\u2019re hearing from executives in terms of their decisionmaking", " MR. HARKER.  I\u2019m just skeptical about that argument", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  With the unemployment rate currently at 4.1 percent and real GDP growth for the past three quarters of this year likely to exceed my estimate of potential growth of 1\u00be percent by more than 1 percentage point, combined with the likelihood that real GDP growth will continue to exceed potential growth for several quarters due  to fiscal stimulus, I now expect the unemployment rate to fall 1 full percentage point below my estimate of the sustainable unemployment rate. On the monetary policy side, the modest reductions in the balance sheet and the increases to date in the federal funds rate have not led to a tightening of overall financial conditions.  The 10-year Treasury rate has fluctuated in a narrow range\u2014low 2.4 percent, credit spreads have narrowed relative to still-low Treasury rates, and the stock market has continued its upward drive.  Thus, our tightening to date appears to have been offset by other factors that have provided unexpected stimulus.  In particular, a tax cut that is primarily focused on reducing corporate taxes has been perceived as potentially increasing after-tax earnings, which justifies the already-high P/E ratios and reduces the risk of credit problems as after-tax profitability increases. As the probability of tax cuts for corporations rises, financial conditions have eased further.  Such easing of financial conditions at this stage of the business cycle can result in an undesirable amount of additional stimulus.  The various models we run show that, in theory, we can return gradually to a more sustainable unemployment rate.  I am quite skeptical that we can engineer a full percentage point increase in the unemployment rate without causing a recession that results in much more significant costs to the economy. In the event of a recession, our tools would be dangerously limited.  With interest rates low and fiscal policy spent, we have little ammunition in reserve to fight a recession and could be faced with large misses on both elements of our mandate, as well as another prolonged period of low interest rates and all of the risks such an episode entails.  In addition, as the unemployment rate eventually rises and the economy slows down, I expect that problems  associated with financial excesses that are often a side effect of very low interest rates will become more apparent. One example of how a low interest rate policy encourages more risk-taking can be found in the leveraged loan market.  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston have obtained a new data set developed by a fintech company that specializes in contract covenant visualization.  Our guidance on leveraged lending was intended to discourage very highly levered loans\u2014for example, ones that had debt in excess of six times earnings.  The contracts have sidestepped that guidance by constraining initial underwriting to below six times earnings over the ability to raise the leverage after origination by making use of the covenant exceptions embedded in the contract.  This type of regulatory arbitrage highlights why addressing the side effects on financial stability of a low interest rate environment may be difficult to offset with only regulatory changes. While keeping rates low for long periods may induce financial stability concerns that we should continue to monitor, a major argument for removing monetary policy gradually is the uncertainty about whether inflation can pick up from its lower-than-expected readings over the past year.  This concern is understandable.  But I believe that, for several reasons, such concern is now moderating. First, the annualized core PCE inflation rate over the past three months has been 1.9 percent, a rate substantially above the average over the past year.  While the 3-month rate is, of course, quite volatile, we know that the 12-month rate of inflation was distorted by what looks to be temporary relative price changes earlier this year. Second, while a number of wage and compensation measures have been rising gradually over the past several years, the employer costs for employee compensation\u2014a series derived  from the ECI source data that allows employment weights to change over time\u2014has risen more rapidly.  This series is based on a firm-level survey and may be thought of as reflecting the wage bill rather than a wage rate and, consequently, may be a better measure of the actual labor cost borne by firms.  Of course, if increases to the overall wage bill were accompanied by a significant rise in productivity\u2014perhaps because employers were hiring more productive workers on the margin\u2014this labor cost increase would be of less concern.  But the aggregate productivity data suggest that that has not been the case, and, as a result, I expect that these increases will eventually translate into higher prices. Third, if the unemployment rate falls as low as the 3.3 percent revised Tealbook forecast inclusive of the tax changes, it seems very likely that wages will begin to grow even faster.  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston staff research suggests that the Phillips curve may become steeper as the unemployment gap turns that negative. In light of the financial stability risks posed by maintaining low interest rates, the increasing tightness in the labor market, and the initial evidence that inflation is firming, my assessment of appropriate policy entails five \u00bc point change increases over the course of 2018.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", "  MR. LAUBACH.5  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will be referring to the handout labeled \u201cMaterial for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.\u201d At the risk of precipitating President Kaplan\u2019s discussion about the yield spread, the focus of my briefing is going to be on that very topic.  And I guess it\u2019s an understatement to say that several of you have remarked on the flattening of the yield curve since you began raising the federal funds rate two years ago\u2014and especially since the beginning of this year.  The light-green line in the upper-left panel shows the behavior of the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 3-month Treasury bill since the early 1970s.  Although the spread has declined by almost 1 percentage point since the turn of the year, it is not unusually low by historical standards.  A similar spread currently stands at about the 40th percentile of its distribution since 1971, as noted in a Tealbook box, and about \u00bd percentage point above the average historical level associated with the onset of recessions, shown by the light-green horizontal line. That said, a number of commentators have asked what the narrowing of the yield spread might portend for the economy\u2019s ability to withstand further removal of monetary policy accommodation.  From the perspective of the expectations hypothesis, an inverted yield curve implies that the current short-term interest rate exceeds the average level that investors expect to prevail over the next 10 years, provided term premiums are not negative.  As the shaded bars in the panel highlight, since the early 1970s, a negative term spread has always been followed by a recession. Many empirical studies have built on this regularity by using the term spread to predict recessions.  As reported in the upper-right panel, when a regression that relates the spread to the event of the economy being in recession at any point over the next four quarters is used, the current level of the term spread implies a nearly 40 percent probability of such an event.  As shown by the red line in the middle-left panel, this probability is up from about 15 percent since you began raising interest rates.  Here I am showing the probability of the economy being in recession at any time during the next four quarters; the Tealbook box reported a substantially lower probability of being in a recession four quarters from now. A substantial likelihood of a near-term recession seems at odds with ongoing robust employment gains, high levels of household and business confidence, expectations of somewhat more rapid economic growth following the anticipated passage of the tax package, and signals from stock prices and risk spreads.  One possible way of resolving these different signals is to note that the relationship between the term spread and the business cycle may have changed as term premiums have declined.  The dark-green line in the upper-left panel shows the term spread after subtracting the 10-year term premium, as estimated by the Kim-Wright model, from the 10-year yield to obtain a direct comparison between the current short-term rate and the component of the 10-year yield reflecting expected future short-term  5 The materials used by Mr. Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).  rates.  This adjusted term spread currently stands a full percentage point above the average level previously associated with the onset of recession, the dark-green horizontal line.  As shown by the blue line in the middle-left panel, when this adjusted spread replaces the raw term spread in the recession probability model, the probability of a recession over the next four quarters is currently estimated to be very low.  However, this model did not indicate as high a probability of recession in 2000 and, especially, in 2007 as the model using the unadjusted spread. Term premium estimates are quite model dependent, and the expectations component of the 10-year yield derived from a term structure model different from the Kim-Wright model might produce a higher probability.  An alternative approach is to combine the unadjusted term spread with other measures of financial conditions to assess the likelihood of near-term recession.  A memo sent to the Committee in March 2016 noted that the excess bond premium developed by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakraj\u0161ek, shown in the middle-right panel, is a useful indicator because it tends to rise in the periods shortly before the onset of recessions, as investors demand higher compensation for bearing credit risk.  This premium has declined notably following a spike in early 2016 and currently stands near the lower end of its historical range.  As indicated by the green dashed line in the middle-left panel, the inclusion of both the unadjusted term spread and the excess bond premium in the regression model generates a probability of recession of around 7 percent. As noted in the lower-left panel\u2014and I\u2019m afraid it becomes evident that I\u2019m cribbing from Governor Brainard\u2019s notes\u2014recent conversations with market participants do not reveal heightened concern regarding the decline in the term spread.  Contacts attributed the compressed spread in large part to the continued low level of the 10-year yield, which in turn reflected not only a low expected longer-run value of the federal funds rate, but also a low inflation risk premium and persistent demand for duration from investors in an environment of low yields globally and low volatility.  In light of these factors, several contacts expressed the view that the slope of the yield curve might not be as effective an indicator of recession risk as in previous economic cycles. The lower-right panel turns to some key considerations for your policy decision at this meeting.  In light of most indicators pointing to continued expansion, and with payroll gains still running at a pace consistent with further tightening in the labor market, you may see the economy as having sufficient momentum that another step toward removing policy accommodation is warranted at this meeting.  Even though inflation remains low, you continue to see it approaching your objective over the next two years.  As Bob Tetlow noted in his briefing, almost all of you expect that the tax package will boost economic growth modestly in the next couple of years.  With the unemployment rate projected to decline well below your estimates of its longer-run normal level, you may see staying on a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as appropriate to balance the risks of continuing to miss your inflation objective and an overheated labor market.  Alternative B addresses both concerns by retaining the emphasis on carefully monitoring inflation developments while also conveying that, although the labor market may strengthen somewhat  further in the near term, the Committee doesn\u2019t see a need to actively pursue an even tighter labor market.  Alternative C sends a message of greater urgency to contain further labor market tightening by stressing the need for growth in output and employment to slow to sustainable rates.  Alternative A, by contrast, expresses sufficient concern about the risk that recent low inflation readings might continue that it is implicitly willing to tolerate a larger undershoot of the unemployment rate below its longer-run level so as to forestall a decline in inflation expectations. Thank you, Madam Chair.  That concludes my prepared remarks.  The November statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 2 to 13 of the handout.  I will be happy to take questions. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams", " MR. WILCOX.  A couple of considerations.  If all elements of long-term rates were created equal, then, for a given funds rate, a steeper yield curve is kind of a two-edged sword for what one would expect for the pace of real activity.  On the one hand, it could be a positive, as Governor Quarles pointed out, if a steeper yield curve is a plus for bank profitability and increases their willingness or wherewithal to extend credit to nonfinancial actors.  On the other hand, I started by positing, for a given funds rate, a steeper yield curve.  Well, that means higher long-term interest rates, and we think that, in many respects, it\u2019s longer-term interest rates that are important for spending through things like mortgage rates or bond rates for investment\u2014that sort of thing.  So that\u2019s one consideration.  There are elements that could go either direction there. The other consideration I would mention is that it could be that not all elements of long-term rates are created equal in terms of their influence on spending.  And\u2014I think Michael Kiley is here.  He had some research earlier, a few years ago, suggesting that the term-premium piece may have less influence on aggregate demand than the expectations-component piece of it. So these issues that you\u2019re raising have a variety of complex crosscurrents involved in them. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, let\u2019s begin the round with President Williams", " MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B and the statement as written. The economy is ending 2017 with some momentum.  Growth is expected to remain above trend.  Labor market conditions are strong and are expected to continue tightening, with the unemployment rate falling further below most estimates of its longer-run rate.  Inflation remains below our 2 percent goal, but it has stabilized in recent months, and I project it to rise back to 2 percent over the next couple of years, albeit gradually.  Taking into account current economic and financial conditions, the medium-run outlook, and the risks associated with the outlook, I view a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate today as an appropriate step in fostering our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. I continue to view the gradual removal of accommodation as being the best strategy for sustaining the expansion and balancing the risks to our dual-mandate goals, with the actual path of the funds rate dependent on how the economy evolves.  The statement language in alternative B gives this message, and I think it\u2019s appropriate.  For the first time in several years, there are some salient upside risks to the forecast.  The tax cuts have the potential to increase growth more than projected, and labor market conditions could tighten even more than anticipated, putting upward pressure on inflation.  On the other hand, it\u2019s difficult to project inflation, and the fact that it\u2019s run below target for some time, even in the face of a tight labor market suggests it could remain low.  There are now also some nascent signs of building financial stability risks, including \u201clofty\u201d commercial real estate prices and high stock market valuations. The possible alternative paths that the economy could take mean we\u2019ll have to be nimble in making our policy decisions.  It would be risky for us to focus only on the undershoot of inflation and ignore the projected undershoot by the unemployment rate of estimates of its natural rate, even though those estimates are imprecise. Similarly, we need to recognize the limitations in our ability to forecast inflation and the possibility it could remain below our goal for longer than we expect.  And we\u2019ll also need to monitor our normalization of our balance sheet and how it\u2019s affecting the economy. But despite the uncertainty about how the economy will evolve, I think it\u2019s important to be transparent with the public.  We need to give them our best sense of the economic outlook, the risks, and what we think appropriate policy will be in response to the outlook and risks.  And we need to do this even though there\u2019s uncertainty about the policy rate path and the path can be expected to evolve depending on the economy.  I think that we\u2019re up to the challenge and that we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to hone our craft in the coming year, albeit without someone who\u2019s been one of our master craftspersons.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Quarles", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support an increase in the target range for the funds rate at this meeting.  This action would represent a continuation of gradual policy adjustments promoting our objective for long-run sustained growth. The proposed language in alternative B, I think, appropriately justifies today\u2019s policy action based on economic conditions, but it stops short of describing the medium-term outlook  for employment and inflation.  While inflation is expected to move gradually toward the Committee\u2019s target, the outlook also anticipates that labor market conditions will deviate further from their long-run sustainable levels.  As we move into 2018, it would be appropriate, in my view, to revisit the language that describes that outlook at one of our future meetings, perhaps along the lines of paragraph 2 in alternative C, which more effectively ties the policy action to the medium-term outlook. With the growing deviation in the unemployment rate over the forecast horizon from its longer-run level, our projections point to a slowing of economic growth below trend, with unemployment eventually rising to its longer-run level.  This has been a challenging needle for policymakers to thread in the past.  It certainly may be the case that this time will be different.  But, with the funds rate remaining below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run, combined with a very large balance sheet only gradually shrinking, we will likely need to wrestle with this communications challenge over the next few years and explain future policy actions in light of such forecasts.
