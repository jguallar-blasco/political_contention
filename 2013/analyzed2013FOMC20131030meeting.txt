Passage number 1.
 Hornstein, Senior Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  Satyajit Chatterjee, Senior Economic Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of PhiladelphiaTranscript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on October 29–30, 2013  October 29 Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  I’d like to start by asking President Rosengren and President Bullard what they bet on the outcome of the World Series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple question about a bet on the outcome of the World Series.


Passage number 2.
 [Laughter] MR. ROSENGREN.  Traditional beer bet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of laughter suggests a lighthearted and possibly friendly atmosphere.


Passage number 3.
 MR. BULLARD.  Local brews.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply mentions "Local brews" without any conflicting or opposing views expressed.


Passage number 4.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Today is Debbie Danker’s last FOMC meeting.  Of a total of 66 meetings, most of them sitting right here to the right of the Chairman, Debbie has done a commendable job of keeping the Chairman and the FOMC mostly on track, although I wish she had a more elastic policy about recording every comment I make in the transcripts.  [Laughter] Over her career, Debbie has brought expertise that’s led her on a tour of the major policymaking institutions, including the New York Fed, the Council of Economic Advisers, the World Bank, the Treasury, and, of course, the Board, where she has worked her way up through the ranks to be deputy director and deputy secretary for the FOMC.  So, for 66 meetings, we thank you for putting up with this group and wish you the very best in your retirement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 5.
  [Applause] MS. DANKER.  Can I just say, it’s been a great privilege.  Thank you very much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
The excerpt does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing gratitude.


Passage number 6.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Before we get started, I want to say a couple words on external communications.  The first is that I’m tentatively planning to announce very shortly a press conference at the January meeting, which will be my last meeting.  That will give us three consecutive meetings with press conferences and, I hope, will enhance our communication over the next few months. The second thing is that I’d like to ask folks—I know it’s tempting to comment on when the FOMC may or may not take a first step toward reducing asset purchases, but it’s probably nota wise thing to do.  In fact, our policy on communications explicitly precludes making comments about “a prediction . . . about Committee action in advance of the Committee’s announcement of such decisions.”  What I hope you will do rather than speculate on timing is to articulate a set of principles, and I would recommend three.  First, data dependence.  We’re going to be tying our decisions, as always, to the incoming data—not one particular piece of data, of course, but the whole general outlook.  The second principle I would suggest would be noting that our criterion of “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” has a retrospective and a prospective component.  Retrospectively, we have seen a good bit of improvement—the term I’ve used is “meaningful” improvement—since September 2012.  It’s worth pointing that out.  I recollect where we feared we might be at this point, and we’re actually in much better shape in the labor market than we thought a year ago.  There’s also a prospective component to our criterion.  We’re hoping to see evidence that the recovery and the improvement in the labor market will continue—and I hope that’s not an excessively high burden, but simply that the outlook for the labor market will continue to improve.  And the third principle I’d recommend to folks is—it’s a phrase I don’t care much for, but—tapering is not tightening, necessarily.  Even as we make the shift from asset purchases to rate policy going forward—and I think this is reflected in our statements—the Committee intends to maintain a highly accommodative policy as needed to achieve recovery and hit our inflation target.  Again, I recognize that there’s a lot of temptation, a lot of speculation.  I think we’re probably better off if we stick to some principles on this issue.  Any comments or questions on that.  [No response] If not, why don’t we go now to our agenda.  Item 1 is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and let me call on Simon Potter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a speaker providing information and making recommendations regarding external communications.


Passage number 7.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Are there questions for Simon or for Steve Kamin.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a statement of gratitude and asks if there are any questions for Simon or Steve Kamin. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 8.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Simon, could you repeat what you mentioned when you were talking about slide 14, and then you rolled over to slide 15, with regard to year-end activity—that “increasing the Federal Reserve’s ownership share could possibly cause. . .”.  Would you repeat that sentence, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a request for clarification.


Passage number 9.
 MR. POTTER.  One of the things we found in our operations recently is that, even though we’re approaching the monthly issuance in the market, we haven’t experienced any liquidity problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage suggests that there are no liquidity problems despite approaching the monthly issuance in the market. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 10.
 MR. FISHER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only includes a statement, "Mr. Fisher. Right," without any indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 11.
 MR. POTTER.  Exhibit 14 shows you that the outstanding stock that we could still purchase is large.  It wouldn’t be a large percentage of that.  However, we don’t know, if we sustained this for a long period of time, where we’re purchasing out of stock, whether that would perhaps affect liquidity conditions in the MBS market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Potter, is expressing uncertainty about the potential impact of sustained stock purchases on liquidity conditions in the MBS market. This disagreement arises from the lack of knowledge or understanding regarding the potential consequences of their actions.


Passage number 12.
 MR. FISHER.  So we’ll just feel our way along the stones.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply suggests a cautious approach to navigating a situation.


Passage number 13.
 MR. POTTER.  We will, as always, monitor and alert you if we’re seeing any market malfunctioning from it, but so far it has gone better than we expected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the performance of something has been better than expected, without any conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 14.
 MR. FISHER.  And then your comment on slide number 6—the slide shows the dealer survey, but you also said “and the public.”  How do we determine how the public would respond.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It is a statement/question made by Mr. Fisher inquiring about how the public's response would be determined. There is no indication of conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 15.
 MR. POTTER.  Oh, that’s just the way that we ask the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply explaining the way a question is asked, without any conflicting opinions or arguments present.


Passage number 16.
MR. FISHER.  Okay.  Of the dealers.  And then the last question I have—which may be based on ignorance, Mr. Chairman—you did mention, Simon, that we’ve increased the quantity limits with regard to the swap lines with the Bank of Canada, correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 17.
 MR. POTTER.  We are going to take the caps off.  They have not used those lines.  So it’s hard to say exactly how much usage there will be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement made by Mr. Potter regarding the removal of caps and uncertainty about the extent of usage. There is no conflicting opinion or argument presented.


Passage number 18.
 MR. FISHER.  And the natural question for me is:  Mexico is not included—is that because we continue on with the program that we currently have.  And is there a reason to differentiate between Canada and Mexico.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply poses a question regarding the differentiation between Canada and Mexico in a program.


Passage number 19.
 MR. POTTER.  Within the foreign currency arrangements that Canada has with the other four central banks, there were no caps.  So what we were trying to do is make the arrangements look symmetric across those six central banks.  The NAFTA lines that were introduced in ’94 are really for a separate purpose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information about foreign currency arrangements and the introduction of NAFTA lines.


Passage number 20.
 MR. FISHER.  Is there a need to communicate with Mexico at all to make that clear, or have we done so—or does it matter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is simply asking a question to clarify the need for communication with Mexico.


Passage number 21.
 MR. POTTER.  I believe that if the Committee approves this resolution, if the Bank of Japan approves tomorrow, and we announce, there will be a lot of interest from other central banks in this standing relationship that we have.  I don’t believe the Mexicans will view this as a really big change, given that they weren’t in this temporary network that we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Potter, is expressing his belief about the potential impact of approving the resolution and the involvement of other central banks. He also mentions his belief about how the Mexicans might perceive the situation. However, there is no direct disagreement or contention being presented.


Passage number 22.
 MR. FISHER.  My sensitivity tells me—or maybe it’s too sensitive—that it might be advisable, at least.  Are we giving them advance notice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement made by Mr. Fisher expressing his opinion or concern about giving advance notice. There is no contention or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 23.
 MR. KAMIN.  No, we’re not.  We never provide advance notice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kamin, explicitly states that they do not provide advance notice.


Passage number 24.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, we might provide them simultaneous notice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is simply suggesting a course of action.


Passage number 25.
MR. KAMIN.  I take your point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "I take your point" suggests that the person speaking understands and acknowledges the other person's perspective without any apparent contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 26.
  I think that the announcement will certainly remind many emerging market economies of these swaps, some of whom have requested it, and so I think taking some proactive action just to— MR. POTTER.  I could certainly give a call to my counterparty at the central bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The first speaker believes that the announcement will remind many emerging market economies of the swaps and some have even requested it. However, the second speaker seems to have a different opinion and interrupts to suggest making a call to their counterparty at the central bank. This interruption indicates a disagreement or differing perspective.


Passage number 27.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I would recommend that.  They’re highly sensitive, and, again, it is part of NAFTA, and with any differentiation between Canada and Mexico, I would suggest politely that we let them know at the earliest opportunity, and before others, if possible.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is making a recommendation and suggesting that Canada and Mexico be notified about something related to NAFTA before others, if possible. There is no indication of a disagreement or opposing viewpoints present.


Passage number 28.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you for that suggestion.  Are there other questions. President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude for a suggestion and asks if there are any further questions.


Passage number 29.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Is this the appropriate time to comment on the swap lines.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is just a question regarding the appropriate timing to comment on swap lines.


Passage number 30.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. "Certainly" is a word used to indicate agreement or confirmation, not contention or disagreement.


Passage number 31.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I generally favor them, but one thing that struck me about the proposal is that a lot of the arguments that were being made to convert the temporary swap line into a more permanent standing arrangement could also be used to argue in favor of having a standing term auction facility as well.  When we had this discussion about the term auction facility in our teleconference call, I was struck by the length of time that it would take the staff to stand up such a facility.  A lot of the concerns that we have about the temporary liquidity lines in terms of the signaling, et cetera, would also be true if we tried to stand up a TAF in the midst of a crisis.  That would send a signal that maybe we’re concerned about things, whereas if we have a permanent facility that’s being run at a relatively small level, we have staff expertise always there, and we don’t really have to worry as much about the signaling content of our decision. The memo makes a very strong case for that being true for the temporary liquidity lines being converted to a standing situation.  That was my only comment.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no explicit contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for the proposal but raising concerns about the time it would take to establish a standing term auction facility and the potential signaling implications. Overall, the speaker's remarks are more about expanding on their support and offering additional considerations rather than disagreeing with the proposal.


Passage number 32.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker, would you like to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply thanking President Lacker and asking if they would like to comment on something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 33.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Richmond Fed is traditionally opposed to foreign swap lines.  In the past, my predecessor and I have voted against these on the grounds that they were an adjunct to foreign exchange operations that were essentially fiscal policy and should be the responsibility of the U.S. Treasury subject to the authorization of the U.S. Congress.  Today we’re being asked to make these things that were adopted on a renewable basis in the midst of the crisis into a relatively permanent arrangement.  Their purpose is not for exchange market intervention this time, but the provision of dollar funding by foreign central banks to overseas financial institutions.  I recognize that the SOMA would not bear exchange risk or credit risk in these transactions, but nonetheless, we’d be facilitating yet another expansion of central bank backstop lending commitments, and I don’t think that’s the best path to financial stability.  So I would oppose authorizing the manager’s request.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows disagreement or contention between the speaker (Mr. Lacker) and the manager's request. Mr. Lacker expresses opposition to authorizing the manager's request for foreign swap lines.


Passage number 34.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any other questions or comments.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of polite and neutral statements.


Passage number 35.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I share some of Richmond’s concern about it.  I have a question:  I gather from the discussion that because we’ve already coordinated with all of the foreign banks that will announce on the 31st, it’s kind of a foregone conclusion that we’re going to do this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any disagreement or contention. Both Mr. Plosser and Richmond share a concern, indicating agreement. Mr. Plosser then asks a question based on the information provided.


Passage number 36.
 MR. POTTER.  No.  They’re all aware that it’s dependent on the vote here and the vote that the Bank of Japan is taking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that everyone is aware that the outcome is dependent on the vote in both the mentioned situations.


Passage number 37.
MR. PLOSSER.  I’m still not convinced why renewing these things on a regular basis or approving caps is problematic from a management standpoint.  Would you care to elaborate a little bit more on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser expresses his lack of understanding and asks for further clarification on the issue, indicating a desire to gain more information and insight.


Passage number 38.
 MR. POTTER.  I find it hard to think what the caps would be in all of the circumstances that might happen over the next few years.  That’s assuming that they would be reauthorized. Among the things that we discussed with you last year about a financial market utility in another area—London was the example we gave you—was that it’s very difficult to contact people in real time to do that.  Now, in terms of how big the swaps could be, that’s really going to be up to the people around this table if we again get into a financial crisis like we saw in 2008.  There’s nothing in here that prevents you from standing up an individual swap arrangement, to put in place some cap, to effect the fees, and so on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 39.
  MR. PLOSSER.  But just as a matter of process, though, there’s a difference between saying that we have the right to change something, or we have to proactively act to do something either less or more, or change the price, as opposed to there being a request that has to come in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing a process and making a distinction between different actions or requests that may need to be taken.


Passage number 40.
 MR. POTTER.  I would distinguish between a continuing request, where we put the framework in place—which is where we are right now with the temporary swap lines, with the pricing in there and the lack of caps, which is supposed to give the impression of a backstop, and has been very successful in that way—and other circumstances in which—it’s hard to think of it—in which the FOMC might decide it would limit what the individual swap draw could be, even within these arrangements.  It doesn’t prevent you from doing that.  What the cap with the Bank of Canada prevented you from doing was having a backstop without a limit on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 41.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions.  [No response]  If not, let me first ask us to vote to ratify the domestic open market operations.  Any objection.  [No response]  Seeingnone.  On the liquidity swap lines, President Lacker has expressed his concern.  Is there anyone else who would like to be on record.  [No response]  All right.  If there’s no objection, I’m going to call for a voice vote, not an individual vote.  All those in favor of approving the swap line directive as given in the handout, please say aye.  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed.  [No response]  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I hope you’ll all be up at 2:00 a.m. to hear the announcement.  [Laughter] All right.  Moving on to item 2, “Economic Situation,” let me call on David Lebow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 42.
 MR. KAMIN.  During the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank that took place a few weeks ago, the attention of policymakers from around the world was squarely focused on the United States:  Would the debt ceiling be raised, and whenwould the Fed start tapering.  By comparison, developments abroad have been reasonably tranquil since your previous meeting:  Financial conditions in the euro area remain suspiciously calm, stresses in emerging markets have eased, and incoming economic data have been largely in line with our expectations.  Thus, for the most part, we have not altered our forecast for economic growth abroad to pick up over the next few years—from only 2 percent in the first half of this year to a healthy 3½ percent by 2016—but our faith in this outlook has been strengthened. In the advanced foreign economies, GDP had already expanded a solid 1¾ percent in the second quarter—a little above what we estimate to be the trend rate for those economies—and we estimate that growth posted a similar pace in the third.  To be sure, the third-quarter growth partly reflected a rebound of the Canadian economy from serious flooding back in June, while the pace of expansion in both Japan and the euro area appears to have fallen back.  However, we aren’t taking a lot of signal from these decelerations.Starting with the euro area, we had always expected that economy to emerge from recession only haltingly, and we understood that its expansion of 1 percent in the second quarter was boosted by transitory factors.  Accordingly, we were not that surprised by data pointing to a slowing of growth to about ½ percent in the third quarter.  Although the euro area faces numerous headwinds that will keep the recovery quite subdued, several factors, including diminishing financial strains, reduced fiscal drag, and accommodative monetary policies, should push GDP growth up to 2 percent by 2015.  Naturally, this forecast depends on the euro-area crisis continuing to wind down.  We are encouraged that financial stresses in the region have indeed continued to ease, and policymakers are making progress, albeit slowly, on important reforms.  Last week, the ECB released its long-awaited blueprint for assessing the health of euro-area banks, a prerequisite for its assuming supervisory control over these institutions next year. In Japan, growth has also slowed, but from an unusually high 4 percent rate in the first half of this year.  Moreover, at an estimated 2 percent in the third quarter, the pace of expansion—driven by yen depreciation, rising stock prices, and improved confidence—remains far above its trend rate of about ½ percent.  Going forward, we are looking for output to decelerate to a little over 1 percent over the next three years as the consumption tax is doubled, thereby offsetting much of the BOJ’s aggressive monetary stimulus.  Even so, this should be sufficient to make significant inroads into Japan’s resource slack and help push inflation up to 1½ percent by 2016, a performance that, if sustained, would mark the end of Japan’s long deflation.   All told, we are looking for growth in the advanced foreign economies to edge up to just over 2¼ percent by 2016.  Together with the acceleration we are projecting for the U.S. economy, this should provide further impetus to the emerging market economies.  GDP growth in the EMEs has already picked up considerably from its slowdown earlier this year, rising from 2½ percent in the second quarter to an estimated 3¾ percent in the third.  Part of that acceleration reflected an apparent rebound in Mexican GDP from its surprise contraction in the second quarter.  But perhaps more significantly, Chinese GDP soared an estimated 9½ percent in the third quarter, nearly 2 percentage points higher than our September forecast.  To be clear, we do not believe the Chinese economy is returning to the days of double-digit growth rates.  In fact, we are projecting growth to fall back to about 8 percent in the current quarter and to edge down further over the next few years.  However, when Chinese growth downshifted to about 7 percent in the first half of this year, we had been worried that this might presage a further sharp slowing that could drag down many of China’s trading partners as well.  Accordingly, although China’s economy faces many challenges—including still-rapid credit growth and a resurgence of property prices—its recent pickup reassures us that a hard landing is more of a risk to the outlook than a near-term certainty, and this is good news for EMEs more generally.  In our projection, total EME growth rises further to 4½ percent next year and beyond, roughly its trend pace, as the recovery in the advanced economies leads to a strengthening of global trade. Besides a hard landing in China, another risk to this outlook is that a resurgence of financial stresses might push one or more especially vulnerable economies into crisis, provoking a pullback by investors and triggering more-generalized turmoil in the EMEs.  We are encouraged that emerging markets appear to have settled down a bit in the past couple of months, as Simon discussed.  But a number of open questions remain.  First, how will emerging markets respond when you finally reduce the pace of asset purchases.  By our reckoning, a small reduction in these purchases should not be all that consequential, but we know that anticipations of tapering roiled emerging markets starting last spring, and that your decision not to taper in September helped diminish these stresses.  Second, even if tapering proceeds smoothly, how vulnerable are emerging markets to the longer-term normalization of global interest rates that will take place as the recovery in advanced economies matures.  In principle, the current configuration of bond yields and exchange rates should incorporate market expectations for future rises in global interest rates, but especially after developments since May, we cannot be so sure.  And finally, how assiduously will the more fragile EMEs work to correct their underlying vulnerabilities.  Years of low interest rates and ready access to international capital diminished the zeal with which EME policymakers addressed their fiscal and other structural problems, and it remains to be seen how quickly these countries can pivot toward more aggressive reforms.  Thank you.  David and I will be happy to answer your questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing an update on the state of the global economy and expressing confidence in the outlook for economic growth. There is no indication of disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 43.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions for the staff.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing gratitude and indicating that there are questions for the staff of President Lacker. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 44.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First let me say, I appreciate the special memo on consumption.  It got me curious about productivity, though.  Your outlook is for productivity growth to pick up going forward.  Nonfarm business productivity has averaged 0.7 percent per year over the past three years, and is at an annual rate of 1.7 percent, I think, overthe next three years in your forecast.  I wondered if you could help us understand what drives that acceleration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing appreciation for a memo and requesting further clarification on a topic.


Passage number 45.
 MR. LEBOW.  Sure.  Some of our interpretation of the performance of the labor market, as you know, is the story of normalization following unusually rapid job losses during the recession itself.  We’ve seen a somewhat faster improvement of the labor market than would be expected under normal circumstances, given the GDP growth as it’s measured over the past period, and that’s reflected in the productivity figures that you’ve seen.  Going forward, it’s very hard to know when this period of normalization will end—what the right timing really is—but our projection is that it is coming to an end, and that we’ll see GDP growth picking up, going forward, bringing it more into line with the pace of labor market improvement.  So we’ll see the faster productivity growth reflecting the end of that normalization period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is stating their interpretation of the labor market performance and their projection for the future without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 46.
 MR. WASCHER.  The other thing I might note is that, if you’re comparing the forecast with recent years, we do think that the financial crisis and deep recession had an effect on the supply side of the economy, and that structural productivity was weaker than, say, it had been prior to the crisis.  A lot of that occurred through capital deepening—just very low rates of investment affecting the capital stocks and capital services.  We also think there is probably some slowing in multifactor productivity that was associated with the deep recession through things like reduced R&D spending or reduced business formation.  Going forward we have the growth rate of structural productivity reverting back to where it had been prior to the crisis.  We’re not catching up in terms of the level, but we are assuming a return to the growth rate that was evident prior to the crisis.  So we are projecting structural productivity growth at a little less than 2 percent, and we think it fell to about 1¼ percent in, say, the 2008–10 period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 47.
MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Could I follow up, Mr. Chairman.  In your narrative what happened during the recession was the opposite of labor hoarding.  It was sort of overly aggressively labor dis-hoarding in some sense, right.  And since then firms have been able to meet a given expansion in demand.  They want to hire more workers to get back to the normal level of staffing relative to the demand that they’re seeing.  Intuitively I’d picture that tailing off as looking like demand growth continuing to be met, but with lower employment growth.  In my mind, that would conjure up a narrative in which demand keeps growing at the same rate—we’ve been getting 2 percent—and employment growth falls, rather than output growth rising for a given employment growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their own understanding and interpretation of the situation, without contradicting or challenging the statements made by others.


Passage number 48.
   MR. LEBOW.  I think that’s right.  I think that this story of labor market normalization is not an argument for faster GDP growth going forward.  I think our projection of faster GDP growth stems from other reasons.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the statement that the story of labor market normalization does not support the argument for faster GDP growth. They then state that their projection of faster GDP growth stems from other reasons, indicating their agreement with a different point of view.


Passage number 49.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is responding to a statement or question, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 50.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 51.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 52.
 WILLIAMS.  Just a question about how to read the market’s expectations for the fed funds rate:  It was striking that the primary dealer survey shows a huge number of people expecting the funds rate liftoff to be in the third or fourth quarter of 2015.  But when you look at the expected fed funds rate, while it is consistent with liftoff around then, it is also consistent with the fed funds rate at about 1½ percent at the end of 2016.  The primary dealers are saying around 2 percent at the end of 2016.  When we look at the mode, it looks like liftoff won’t be until 2017.  This is a question for Simon, or for anybody:  How am I supposed to understand what the market expectations for monetary policy are when there is such a big differencebetween the mode and the implied fed funds rate—which is, I think, the reasonable view given the zero bound—as well as between the mean and the primary dealer survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Williams, is expressing confusion and questioning how to interpret market expectations for monetary policy due to the discrepancy between different sources of information (mode vs. implied fed funds rate, mean vs. primary dealer survey).


Passage number 53.
 MR. POTTER.  The term premium could account for some of this, but it seems it would have to account for a lot of it.  The model that produced this is the floor and caps—is that right, Bill.  This is in Tealbook, Book A, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 54.
 MR. ENGLISH.  No.  I think the chart that you’re showing is just based on the means and assuming no term premium.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's opinion about the chart being shown.


Passage number 55.
 MR. POTTER.  I think President Williams is looking at the chart from Tealbook A, that has the mode and the closing caps.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply indicates that Mr. Potter believes President Williams is looking at a specific chart from Tealbook A.


Passage number 56.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Neither yes nor no. The passage is not provided, so it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 57.
 WILLIAMS.  I’m actually looking at the Monday morning briefing chart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker, Williams, is looking at a Monday morning briefing chart.


Passage number 58.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think on that chart we showed both the mean and the mode.  For the means, we have done exercises looking at the term premiums implied by our yield curve models applied to OIS.  Those term premiums have moved around over time and have accounted for some of the run-up and then some of the run back down again in those charts, which are plotted assuming no term premium.  So there is some effect of term premiums there.  On the modes, I actually am not exactly sure.  Jim, can you tell us what’s assumed there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is mainly providing information and seeking clarification.


Passage number 59.
 MR. CLOUSE.  Yes.  We don’t make any adjustment for term premiums in the modes either.  We have a lot of difficulty in teasing out the correct term premium for these futures paths, so we tend to show the straight readings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about their approach to adjusting for term premiums.


Passage number 60.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is not providing any information or making any claims, so there is no opportunity for contention or disagreement.


Passage number 61.
 WILLIAMS.  A question I also have is just how low these expectations are.  The mode has the fed funds rate at zero through 2016 and at basically 75 basis points in the middle of 2017.  What is your interpretation of why that is so low compared with the primary dealer survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 62.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I read the primary dealer survey as telling us something about the mean, like the mean values that are in that chart.  And the difference between the mean and the mode is largely the zero bound.  It’s just that if you think the most likely path is some trajectory, you can’t go below zero.  But if the economy picks up and the funds rate goes up, you can end up quite a bit above that mode, and so the mean is going to just be pulled above the mode by the zero bound.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement explaining the difference between the mean and the mode in relation to the zero bound in a primary dealer survey.


Passage number 63.
  MR. POTTER.  So is it possible the mode is still not that likely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Potter, expressing the possibility that the mode is not likely.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 64.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Well, yes, absolutely.  And there is probably considerable uncertainty, so there may not be that much weight around the mode.  There’s a lot of uncertainty about the outlook for the funds rate, for sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is considerable uncertainty and that there is a lot of uncertainty about the outlook for the funds rate. This suggests that there may be differing opinions or perspectives on the matter.


Passage number 65.
 MR. CLOUSE.  Just for what it’s worth, the models that we use to try to tease out the true underlying expected path were actually shown in one of the memos we sent to the Committee.  And those models would have the term premium being negative, so that means the actual expected path is higher.  At least according to that particular model, the expected funds rate at the end of 2016 is more like 2½ percent, which is actually a bit above where the Committee’s expectations were and seemingly a little bit better aligned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing different models and their predictions, but there is no clear contention or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 66.
  MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or statements that suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 67.
 WILLIAMS.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Okay. Thank you" indicates agreement or acquiescence.


Passage number 68.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions for our colleagues.  [No response]  If not, then we can begin our economic go-round, and I have Charlie Plosser at the top of my list.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that if there are no other questions, they can move on to their economic go-round, with President Plosser being the first on the speaking list.


Passage number 69.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been little change in Third District conditions since our previous meeting, with our region continuing to grow at a moderate pace.  Indeed, this has been true since our June forecasting exercise as well.  The partialshutdown of the federal government has yet to show any noticeable adverse impact on our overall economic activity or the outlook for the region.  Housing and commercial real estate activity continue to pick up; manufacturing continues to expand.  Philadelphia leading indexes point to continued growth over the next six months, and the outlook among our business contacts remains positive.   Our October Business Outlook Survey came in about as strong as our September survey did.  The general activity index has now posted five consecutive positive readings and shows broad-based strength.  The indexes of new orders, shipments, and employment remain well into positive territory, suggesting improving conditions.  The robust growth in housing activity in July did show to a somewhat more modest pace than in August and September, although the data have not permitted us to be more precise about September housing permits as yet.  The pace of commercial real estate activity has actually improved over the past couple of months.  Our business contacts in the retail and service sectors continue to report modest growth through early October.  Third District banks continue to report modest increases in loan volumes.  Labor markets in our three-state region continue to slowly strengthen.  Payroll employment has expanded over the past three months, and my staff forecast is for modest improvement in the regional labor markets over the next year. On the national front, the outlook has changed little since June as well.  The near-term outlook for 2013 has been marked down slightly, but the medium-term outlook for 2014 and ’15 remains pretty much the same as it has been for several forecasting periods.  The September jobs report received more than its share of attention, given the delays in other important data releases.  Although the report was perceived as weak, the overall state of the labor market continues to improve.  It’s important to recognize that since the recovery began, the first estimates of payroll increases have been revised up, on average, by 29,000 jobs each month.  I would also note thatthe standard deviation of the revisions between the first print and the last print is more than 46,000.  So I think we would be well advised to put very little weight on these initial estimates and avoid letting them play a large role in our policy decision process. Looking past the monthly ups and downs, the economy continues to add jobs, and unemployment continues to fall.  In this context, the recent drop in labor force participation rates has been viewed with some concern.  The decline in participation rates leads some to view the fall in unemployment as overstating the progress being made in the labor market.  There is also some concern that the unemployment rate might even reverse and move back up as discouraged workers return to the labor force.  Research by my staff, using micro data from the Current Population Survey on the reasons for nonparticipation, questions this view.  Since the start of 2012—that is, over about the past year and a half or two years, roughly speaking—the unemployment rate has declined a little more than 1 percentage point, and the participation rate has declined about 0.5 percentage point.  Research by my staff indicates retirements can entirely accounted for the decline in the participation rate.  Now, the decision to retire may well be affected by the state of the economy, but reentry rates from retirement are historically very, very low and indeed have not changed very much, even over this cycle.  Thus, it appears unlikely that those who left the labor force, at least over the past couple of years, will seek employment and return to the labor force as the economy improves.  Overall, my view is that the medium-term outlook has changed very little since June.  Output continues to grow; unemployment continues to fall; employment continues to grow; and we still forecast inflation to return toward our goal.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an update on Third District conditions and the overall economic outlook, and there is no indication of any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 70.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude from someone named President Rosengren.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 71.
MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s forecast is quite similar to the staff’s Tealbook forecast, including some of the interesting contours of that forecast.  Like the Tealbook, we expect that the second half of this year will look much like the first and that we will finally live up to our New Year’s resolutions over the past few years and GDP growth will rise from 2 percent to 3 percent beginning in the new year.  But just how confident can we be that this time we will achieve our resolution. Looking at some of the initial conditions, one can certainly argue that an uptick to growth is a realistic expectation.  An important component of this forecast is the increase in consumer spending due to a variety of factors that, by historical standards, appear to be quite favorable.  Consumers are wealthier, as both the stock market and housing prices have surprised on the upside over the past year.  While the recent payroll employment numbers have been disappointing, total payroll employment has risen by more than 2 million jobs over the past year.  Oil prices have come down, leaving more disposable income to purchase other items.  Finally, consumer balance sheets are healthier, and interest rates on auto loans and home loans remain quite low by historical standards. I would have expected these same positive events to have carried over to improved consumer sentiment.  However, that has not been the case.  Work by the Boston staff finds that sentiment remains surprisingly low, not only by historical standards but also relative to factors that normally drive consumer sentiment.  If one forecasts sentiment using economic variables that capture income, employment, inflation, commodity prices, and stock prices, there is a fairly tight in-sample fit.  However, currently sentiment is roughly 10 points lower than what would be expected from the out-of-sample forecast equation.  The source of the depressed consumer is hard to pinpoint, but it does raise a concern that after New Year’s Eve, the morning-afterhangover may not lead consumers to spend as currently projected by models using historical data.  Certainly, one might conjecture that another prolonged discussion about the debt ceiling and government shutdown will do little to boost consumer confidence in the future. This highlights a second potential risk to the forecast:  the outlook for fiscal policy.  Even during less fiscally entertaining times, forecasts of government spending have economically meaningful standard errors.  Work by the Boston staff looked at how well forecasts of government spending captured subsequent government spending.  One might have expected that with an improved budget process, government spending would be fairly predictable.  However, the standard errors for both semiannual and annual forecasts of spending since 1979 are relatively large and indicate a fairly high degree of uncertainty about the accuracy of government spending forecasts.  In many cases over the past 25 years, the forecast errors have indicated that when the economy is weaker than expected, government spending tends to be larger than forecast.  I am concerned that this time the correlation may switch sign.  Government spending remains difficult to predict.  But while the precise timing and nature of the next fiscal agreement remain quite uncertain, the risk that we will experience disruptive fiscal discussions followed by more short-term fiscal austerity than is needed in the current economy remains quite elevated. In fact, my own recent forecast errors suggest that that pattern is something to worry about for the coming year.  Over the past few years, my baseline forecasts up to the actual fiscal decisions were that the 2011 debt ceiling discussion would not be disruptive, that the sequestration would not be implemented, and that this year we would avoid a government shutdown and another disruptive debt ceiling discussion.  That I have consistently assumed that irrational fiscal policy that damages the economy would be avoided, and that those errors have all gone in one direction with downside consequences for the economy, makes me pause as Ithink about a 2014 forecast that once again assumes that fiscal shocks will not drag down growth next year. Despite these concerns, I still expect the 2014 economic data to be better than the series of disappointments we experienced in the 2013 economic data, with real GDP growth accelerating from the 2 percent rate we expect in the second half of this year to 3 percent next year.  However, my forecast, based on an optimistic expectation of improved consumer spending and fewer headwinds from fiscal policy, does not have balanced risks.  The downside risks should make us unwilling to reduce stimulus until the economic growth we are expecting is clearly in the data, not just in the forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is presenting a forecast that is optimistic about the future of the economy, but also raises concerns about consumer sentiment and the uncertainty of government spending. The author believes that the forecast has downside risks and argues against reducing stimulus until there is clear evidence of economic growth.


Passage number 72.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude and recognition towards President Bullard.


Passage number 73.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Data collected during the past six weeks suggest that economic activity in the Eighth District has grown at a moderate pace.  Most business contacts in the District think their businesses are performing better than a year ago, but that business conditions in the third quarter were similar to those in the second quarter.  In other words, there does not appear to have been any marked upturn in business performance so far during the second half of 2013, contrary to the Committee’s hopes earlier this year. Some signs from the District’s formidable transportation industry do seem to indicate that improved macroeconomic performance is possible during the coming quarters.  One large firm indicated that capital expenditure outlays will likely double next year, even in the face of relatively lackluster business conditions currently and relatively high levels of business uncertainty.  This was a clear case of trying to put cash to work rather than allowing it to lie idle on a firm’s balance sheet.  Another large firm indicated some difficulty in attempting to hire about 4,000 temporary seasonal workers to handle increased holiday traffic.  This could be anindication that labor markets are somewhat firmer than the Committee has been expecting recently. Reports for planned activities in manufacturing and most services have been positive.  Real estate conditions in the District continue to improve in terms of both quantity and price.  District job growth has been modestly slower than job growth in the nation as a whole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 74.
  The District’s unemployment rate, measured across District MSAs, was 7.4 percent in the latest reading, somewhat above the national unemployment rate.  One concern of mine during 2013 has been that the District unemployment rate has begun to run slightly above the national rate, while historically, the District rate was well below the national rate.  This is a trend to watch going forward. Nationally, the economy shows few signs of the momentum swing to the upside that the Committee has been hoping for during 2013.  Nonfarm payrolls were weaker than expected in September.  Furthermore, there has been a marked slowing in the pace of private nonfarm payroll hiring over the past few months, relative to the first half of the year and the last quarter of 2012.  Consumption spending is likely to come in lower than we would like during the third quarter, with especially slow spending in the service sector.  Also worrisome, as mentioned earlier:  There is, at this point, little evidence of a sustained rebound in labor productivity growth. I still see inflation running well below our target of 2 percent.  I view it as important to the credibility of our inflation target that we be able to hit the target over a reasonable time frame.  With crude oil prices having recently turned down, it is probable that consumer energy prices will follow.  Although inflation-sensitive data are sparse because of the government shutdown, available data have mostly come in lower than expected.  Market-based inflationexpectations over the next five years remain around 1¾ percent, with inflation expectations over the next two years lower, a bit less than 1½ percent.  I take that number very seriously. Residential and nonresidential construction activity nationally appeared to advance at a fairly healthy pace during the third quarter.  Still, continued declines in the housing affordability index are expected to dampen growth in residential housing. Despite the lackluster data available as of this meeting, I caution the Committee to wait until the dust has settled on 2013 outcomes before judging the results, and on this dimension I agree with President Plosser.  As always, our readings on the economy are highly variable and could be substantially revised.   I continue to see the case for an improved macroeconomic outlook in 2014 as good.  In particular, with Europe finally exiting its recession and global growth prospects generally improving, a reasonable forecast is that 2014 U.S. GDP growth will top 3 percent.  While it is true that many forecasts of U.S. GDP growth in recent years, including my own, have tended to be overly optimistic, I think it is unlikely that the U.S. economy will continue to surprise on the downside, barring a catastrophic event. Speaking of catastrophic events, let me now turn to make a few comments on the national pastime.  I refer not to the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red Sox World Series matchup, although I have recently marked up my probability of a disaster outcome in that sector [laughter] significantly.  In particular, I may soon be forced to pay off my bet with President Rosengren concerning a six-pack of the “local brew” to the winner.  No, I refer not to baseball but to the other national pastime:  partisan bickering in Washington.  While I agree with much of the analysis in the Tealbook concerning the potential effects of the government shutdown and the associated brinkmanship on macroeconomic outcomes, I am very cautious about any intimationfrom this Committee that partisan volatility is a new variable governing monetary policy.  This Committee may well need to make key monetary policy decisions at junctures when the level of partisan volatility is higher than desired, as it has in the past.  And, accordingly, I think it is undesirable to suggest that the Committee will necessarily remain on hold until Washington waters are completely calm.  That may be a very, very long wait.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 76.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before I get to my economic report, I want to get a jump on the praise and honors that you will deservedly be receiving over the next three months.  It turns out, in 1932, the Coca-Cola Company sponsored a portrait of Santa Claus, and they have decided to update it this year to make it more modern.  And my deadline for input is in early November.

  So with your permission— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’d have to check with my Yiddish grandmother on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the need to consult the speaker's Yiddish grandmother before making a decision or confirming something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 78.
  [Laughter] MR. LOCKHART.  By the way, just to prove the point, that’s what Santa Claus used to look like.  Next year— [Laughter] The tone of anecdotal reports from a pretty large sample of contacts in the Sixth District over the past three weeks was downbeat compared with the period before the September meeting and earlier in the year.  Many had expected a pickup in activity in the second half.  That acceleration has not materialized.  While most anticipate continued slow growth in the near term, many of our contact reports sounded the themes of increased uncertainty and greater caution.   The fiscal drama seems to have adversely affected household and business sentiment at least for a while.  The Affordable Care Act, the sequestration, and the regulatory environment were also cited as factors weighing negatively on confidence.A trucking firm expressed concern over a soft holiday season as some of its large customers, notably big-box and dollar stores, recently began cutting shipments.  A national distributor of maintenance and replacement industrial parts described flat demand from its 150,000 industrial customers and offered that manufacturers are building for orders, not for inventory.  Retail industry reports were mixed, but most contacts reported a decline in sales and demand following a slower-than-expected summer and back-to-school season.  Some retailers also indicated that they planned to hire fewer seasonal staff, reflecting less optimistic expectations about the upcoming holiday season.  We did hear reports of strength in consumer spending at the high end, reinforcing the perception of a two-tier consumer spending picture.  We heard concern expressed that households with tighter budgets may incur a hit to disposable income because of higher health care insurance expense. Business investment appetite and intentions remain soft, with outlays aimed at equipment replacement rather than expansion.  We heard a number of reports of deferred investment decisions.  Our anecdotal feedback on employment trends and intentions was mixed.  Sectors such as energy, IT, auto, and construction continue to report incremental hiring.  In the auto sector, however, a provider of temporary labor reported a slowdown in manufacturers’ converting temporaries to permanent employees.  A director in the hospital industry reported layoffs due to reduced Medicare reimbursement.  Otherwise we mostly heard reports of delaying additions to employment levels and resorting to increased hours to meet business demand. As regards price pressures, our contacts reported little concern about inflation.  Cost pressures seemed to be well contained.  Isolated industries, including fast food, grocery, and commodity construction materials, reported being able to get the market to accept small price increases.  Wages remained stable across most industries.To sum up, many of our business contacts this cycle reported revising down their expectations for the fourth quarter and 2014.  I think it is prudent not to overreact to mood swings among our public contacts, particularly directly after the spectacle of fiscal impasse here in Washington.  That said, my sense of the data points to continued slow growth in the vicinity of 2 percent rather than the hoped-for acceleration to something closer to 3 percent.  So I am once more marking down my near-term outlook and struggling with the question of whether to scale back economic growth projections for the medium term.  At the very least I feel I have to put more weight on downside risk for economic growth and inflation at this juncture than I did in September. The Tealbook’s economic growth projection was revised downward a touch in 2013, but revised up marginally in 2014 and 2015.  My forecast continues to be less optimistic over the medium term than the Tealbook, and I admit to growing embarrassment with my persistently overly optimistic growth forecasts.  I’m increasingly skeptical that the explanation is an unusual sequence of one-off events and temporary headwinds, and even if the reality is not something more persistent, I’m finding it hard to convince myself that the economy will not limp along, if not indefinitely, then for quite a while longer.  This makes a tapering decision look more like a policy choice requiring extremely deft explanation, and I’ll elaborate more in the next round on that. In the very near term, we may not get much help in clarifying the economic picture from incoming data, some of which are likely to be less reliable.  Also, the potential for some kind of replay of the fiscal drama clouds the near term through February at least.  These are frustrating circumstances in which to wrestle with the question of appropriate monetary policy, and I lookforward to the next two rounds for enlightenment from my colleagues.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 81.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you.  I don’t see the economic outlook much differently today than I did at our previous meeting.  So I suppose I could stop there, but I will offer a few reasons as to why I don’t see the outlook as changed. As has been mentioned, the government shutdown has interfered with the flow of data that we would typically receive during an intermeeting period.  Based on our Beige Book calls and outreach to my business contacts, economic activity in my District has generally continued to expand at a fairly steady pace, with particular strength in autos and shale gas extraction activities.  But many District contacts emphasize the uncertainty about the outlook that rose as the government shutdown dragged on.  They stated that they were waiting to see how that dispute would be resolved before making larger investment and hiring decisions.  The postponement of finding a satisfactory resolution to the fiscal problems is being taken as just that—a postponement rather than a resolution.  Depending on how business confidence evolves, there is room for either stronger economic growth, as the recent ISM data show, or more of the same slow growth trajectory. Of course, the BLS did eventually release the September labor market report, and in my view it was a mixed bag of information.  The employment gains continued at a rate of 148,000 in September, which is not statistically different from the average pace of gains over the previous six months.  The media coverage following that release focused on whether that 148,000 pace might persuade this Committee to delay the slowing of our purchase programs.  Because of that, it was hardly noticed that the unemployment rate dipped another tenth, to 7.2 percent.  While itcertainly would be more encouraging to have stronger employment growth, the progress in the unemployment rate over the past 12 months has been primarily the result of employment gains that cumulatively, in my view, have been substantial. As the staff memo on alternative simple rules for large-scale asset purchases demonstrates, expectations for the labor force participation rate are critical to any assessment of substantial progress in the outlook for labor markets.  Despite the fact that participation rates remain about 3 percentage points lower than prior to the recession, a strong case can be made that much of the reduction in the participation rate has been due to demographic trends, not the business cycle.  The reductions in participation that have occurred generally have been consistent with models of trend participation that are maintained by my staff and that were published in research done by the Board’s staff several years ago.  Relative to recent declines in participation, and the demographic trend that is pushing the participation rate lower, the Tealbook’s projection of only gradual declines in the participation rate from today’s level actually represents a small cyclical rebound in participation.  And it’s worth noting that even when we did see those relatively stronger employment gains during this recovery, we didn’t see evidence that there would be a cyclical rebound in participation. Now, in addition, my Bank’s analysis of labor market flows continues to show a fundamentally less dynamic labor market, as measured by the churn rate, compared with either the 1980s or the 1990s.  These changes look to be a part of a longer-term trend and, thus, are less likely to represent cyclical factors.  My Bank’s analysis suggests that the less dynamic labor market and a flat-to-declining participation rate make job gains of about 150,000 per month the expected outcome.  In this model, these moderate employment gains result in steady progress in the unemployment rate, as we have in fact experienced over the past six months.  So as much aswe’d all prefer a faster pace of job growth, we should not view the recent pace of job gains as inadequate for making progress in labor markets.  While these results are model dependent, the labor market data of the past few years have repeatedly shown that this recovery does not require 200,000 jobs per month to make progress on the unemployment rate.  Indeed, the unemployment rate has declined 2.8 percentage points since its peak at 10 percent in 2009.  Again, although a faster decline would have been helpful, given the high starting rate of unemployment, the decline in the unemployment rate in this recovery turns out to be comparable to or faster than that in the prior two recoveries. Turning to inflation, we will have to be cautious in interpreting incoming price reports for some time.  While people are generally discussing the effects of the shutdown on employment figures, the shutdown of the BLS also has the potential to add more noise to our price data.  Analysis at my Bank suggests that the errors due to missed price observations at the individual item level will be the largest in the October data, but that errors can persist for up to six months, as not all items are surveyed every month.  Of course, errors in the CPI will also affect the PCE price index, given the common source data for these indexes.  Given these issues, it seems most likely that the somewhat reduced signal in incoming data will lead us to conclude that the inflation rate has remained low but should gradually head higher. While uncertainty has increased, and data releases over the next few months will have more noise than usual, my forecast is little changed from the previous FOMC meeting, and I continue to see slow but steady improvements in labor markets and a gradual rise in inflation toward our 2 percent longer-term objective.  I continue to judge the overall risk to economic growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 84.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The partial government shutdown has complicated our job, but only in three relatively minor ways.  First, the drop in government-worker hours creates a one-time dip in fourth-quarter real GDP.  But with retroactive paychecks for all federal employees, fourth-quarter nominal GDP and GDI are unaffected, and those measures are arguably the more relevant ones that are determining aggregate demand in this situation.  The indirect impact on private-sector contractors and suppliers also seems modest.   Second, the budget and debt ceiling battles had a broader effect on confidence and sentiment, but that effect appears to have been transitory.  Daily measures of policy uncertainty spiked in mid-October, but then they fell back rapidly after the government reopened.  Similarly, daily Gallup polls of consumer confidence bounced back significantly after dropping in the first half of October.  Such ephemeral shifts in uncertainty and consumer confidence should leave relatively little imprint on household and business spending.  Third, the shutdown delayed some macroeconomic data releases, but we are far from flying blind.  Only two releases are still missing:  September new home sales and the September CPI.  The CPI will be released tomorrow morning, but already private-sector data have helped fill the gap.  We have the September and October inflation readings from the Billion Prices Project developed at MIT.  Each day this initiative scrapes Internet price data and creates an index that closely tracks the CPI.  Its latest readings, running through near the end of October, show a CPI-consistent inflation rate of about 2 percent, indicating that overall inflation remains in line with recent trends.  I might add that the initial read on third-quarter GDP, which won’t be available tomorrow as originally scheduled, is mostly an aggregation of publicly available monthly data, plus BEA assumptions about missing months.  And it typically doesn’t add much to our existing information set.Now, to further make up for any remaining data shortfall, we have the Beige Book and other business reports.  My contacts suggest that the forces driving a pickup in economic growth remain on track.  For one, demand for housing and home-related products has remained resilient despite the run-up in mortgage rates.  Similarly, in commercial real estate, the rise in CMBS spreads is not hampering activity, but merely prompting developers to switch to bank loans as a source of funding.  More broadly, my business contacts do not see significant changes in financial conditions.  Large corporations can still readily find funds at low rates, and credit availability for smaller firms and those with below-average credit qualifications has not deteriorated either.  More broadly, with record highs in the stock market, a depreciating dollar, and shrinking junk bond yield spreads, I see little evidence of a significant tightening of overall financial conditions since the spring.  This conclusion is supported by measures of aggregate financial conditions compiled by Bloomberg, the Chicago Fed, and Goldman Sachs, which are little changed or even looser than earlier this year. Let me turn to labor market conditions; I’m going to echo some of the comments President Pianalto just made.  That is, to interpret recent employment reports, it is important to set a realistic benchmark.  Researchers at the Chicago and San Francisco Feds have estimated that job gains of more than 125,000 jobs per month should be enough to continue pushing down the unemployment rate.  September payrolls rose more than that.  Likewise, a range of other measures, including the unemployment rate, have shown diminishing labor market slack.  As I have noted previously, the unemployment rate is a highly reliable, though not perfect, measure of labor market strength. Recent work by my staff at the San Francisco Fed has studied the reliability of the unemployment rate by reexamining the relationship between GDP and unemployment, otherwiseknown as Okun’s law.  Over the past several years, we have heard repeatedly that Okun’s law is dead, but because it is one of the few things I learned in economics, I really want to keep to it, so I’m going to argue that it’s still alive.  The main evidence for the demise in Okun’s law is a surprising divergence in the movements of unemployment and GDP during the recession and recovery.  Early in the recession, the unemployment rate rose rapidly, while GDP fell more slowly.  As the economy recovered, the reverse occurred, and the unemployment rate has come down significantly while GDP growth has been moderate at best.  My staff revisited this issue using both real-time and revised data, and they found some pretty interesting results.  They found that in real time the initial data releases on the growth in real GDP per capita and changes in the unemployment rate did indicate some breakdown in Okun’s law.  However, revised data showed no such disruption in the typical relationship between GDP and unemployment.  GDP now shows a sharper decline during the recession and faster growth during the recovery than the original estimates, restoring the normal Okun’s law relationship.  This analysis also found that the recent behavior of Okun’s law is remarkably consistent with the pattern in other deep recessions, looking back at 1973 and 1981–82.  Interestingly, if you use real gross domestic income as a measure of output rather than GDP, Okun’s law was never particularly out of line, either in real time or with the revised data.  Altogether this evidence suggests that the unemployment rate is not out of line with signals from the aggregate output and income statistics.  This reassures me that the unemployment rate continues to provide a reasonably accurate signal about the strength of the labor market and the degree of slack in the economy.  Thank you.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 86.
MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As best I can tell from the data in hand and my business contacts, the economic situation hasn’t changed a great deal since our September meeting, so in some respects, like President Pianalto, I could stop at this point.  I’ll go on briefly. It’s still difficult to assess the strength of the economy, especially the effect on activity of the financial market tightening overall since last spring.  Not only was the data flow interrupted by the government shutdown, but it is also hard to interpret the data and anecdotal information we do have, because they are colored by households’ and businesses’ reactions to the drama in Washington.  With that caveat, and as in the Tealbook, it looks to us like economic growth is continuing to muddle along at about a 2 percent rate.  Two thousand thirteen will likely turn out to be yet another example of events intervening to dash our beginning-of-year hopes for a meaningful step-up in activity.  The recent labor market data are consistent with this assessment.  My conversations with directors and business contacts also reinforce this view of muddling along. On the positive side, auto sales continue to be relatively strong.  Demand and pricing for steel has remained solid.  Businesses have breathed a sigh of relief with Europe finally beginning to grow again, and there are fewer worries now about slowing in China.  But the downside risks remain substantial.  In addition to the usual suspects—perhaps it is a national pastime—there is the new risk that Washington will schedule quarterly tournaments in brinkmanship.  It’s sort of exasperating.  In such circumstances, businesses and households are exceedingly unlikely to accelerate their spending plans.  Indeed, none of my business contacts expressed plans to increase hiring or capital expansion through the first half of 2014 and certainly not before customer demand increases substantially, as President Fisher also alluded to.  And inflation continues to be low.In this environment, accommodative policies remain essential to supporting the economic growth prospects that we do have.  In sum, the limited information we have received since our September meeting did not strengthen the case for making an initial reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  We are still very much in a wait-and-see mode for our long-awaited virtuous cycle.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. While the speaker acknowledges that there are some positive indicators in the economy, such as strong auto sales and solid steel demand, they also express concern about downside risks and the lack of acceleration in spending plans from businesses and households. They argue that accommodative policies are still necessary to support economic growth, indicating a differing view from those who might argue for a reduction in the pace of asset purchases.

Passage number 88.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  During the intermeeting period, we heard numerous reports in the Ninth District that indicated that employers were finding it more challenging to find workers.  Both small and large businesses from around the District told us that they saw the pool of available workers as being smaller and systematically lower quality than a year ago.  These reports are congruent with the low unemployment in our District.  As of August, the District unemployment rate was around 5 percent.However, despite the reports of labor market tightness, there is little evidence yet of accelerating wage pressures.  Businesses largely continue to think of wage growth in the 3 to 4 percent range as being appropriate.  Indeed, the Ninth District Beige Book reports that, just like over a year ago, more than 40 percent of companies report no plans to raise wages.  We should, of course, be cautious about generalizing to the entire country from the small Ninth District.  But that said, I do see these observations as suggesting that wage and goods inflation pressures will remain muted nationally, even when unemployment is considerably lower and when workers have become much harder to find.  In passing, I will comment on some of the work that President Williams summarized and the work that President Pianalto summarized.  I think that this work is very valuable in trying to provide a benchmark look at the labor market, but I also think that wage pressures andinflation really are a very important guide in terms of thinking about whether or not labor markets are improving too rapidly or insufficiently rapidly.  And I will come back to that when I talk about the national picture, which I am about to turn to now. So let me turn to the national economy.  It’s tempting at this point in my remarks to spend a great deal of time on the evolution of labor market indicators since last September.  After all, our communication—indeed, our thinking—about the asset purchase program has tended to center on the following question:  Has the labor market improved sufficiently relative to last September to warrant reducing the flow of purchases.  But the reactions of markets and the public to our communications over the past six months have convinced me that our focus on this backward-looking question is leading us astray.  In my view, the markets and the public see the FOMC as being forward-looking decisionmakers.  As a result, markets and the public are not all that interested by what we meant in September 2012 by the words “substantial improvement,” or even what we mean by those words now.  Instead, they operate under the presumption that we will reduce the flow of purchases whenever we believe that doing so is necessary to curb an overly rapid rate of expansion of prices and/or employment. This assumption by markets and the public that we will taper when we feel the economy is in danger of overheating is exactly what makes near-term tapering so challenging.  Under what I perceive to be the Committee’s monetary policy stance, my outlook for the national economy is not all that different from Tealbook, Book A’s.  I see inflation remaining below target for the next four to five years, and unemployment falling only slowly to its lower, long-run level.  How should the Committee respond to such an outlook.  Both prices and employment are too low relative to the Committee’s long-run goals.  With this outlook, talking about tapering sends thefollowing message:  “The Committee is trying to slow the recovery down even though the economy remains far from the FOMC’s stated long-run goals.”  And just forget about the employment picture for the moment.  There is a long-standing debate in economics about the effect of monetary policy on employment.  That debate has gone on for many years and will continue to go on.  There is much less of a debate on our ability to influence prices.  So let’s just focus on inflation.  It is running at about 1.2 percent, and we expect it to rise only slowly back to 2 percent.  Reducing accommodation, given that outlook for prices, tells the public that we actually prefer to see persistent gaps between realized inflation and our target.  With that messaging in mind, I don’t think we should be surprised that our recent communications have created considerable policy uncertainty. Now, as it turns out, I think the markets and the public are right that the FOMC is ultimately a forward-looking body of decisionmakers.  I think what the markets and public are missing is that there is something else in our thought processes, that our choices about asset purchases are not based solely on our assessment of the economic outlook, or whether the economy is overheating or not.  Instead, our decisions about this tool are being influenced in important ways by costs and efficacy considerations.  In my view, our real communication problem is that we have not been sufficiently transparent about the importance of these other factors in our thinking.  So what I’m suggesting here, Mr. Chairman, is that in addition to the three principles you laid out, we should consider adding a fourth principle of communication:  that we should emphasize the cost and efficacy considerations that make LSAPs distinct in our mind from the fed funds rate.  I will have more to say about this issue of transparency in the next go-round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 90.
MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District economy continues to grow.  It has been supported by a notable pickup in construction.  Employment continues to expand at a moderate pace in most District states, although those gains have slowed somewhat over the past six months in part because of job losses in the federal government and energy sectors.  District manufacturing activity expanded in September and October, and manufacturing survey respondents expect a similar pace of expansion over the next six months.  Energy activity remained steady in September, with rig counts roughly flat and coal production improving slightly.  The corn and soybean harvest is well under way across the Midwest.  Yields are healthy, and as a result we are experiencing lower crop prices, which have helped the livestock industry to surpass breakevens for the first time in over a year.  But despite projected lower farm incomes, District farmland values have continued to rise to about 20 percent higher than a year ago. My District business and labor contacts met last week, representing a variety of national and global businesses in areas such as children’s apparel, supplying stores like Wal-Mart, Target, and Kohl’s; fueling stations and convenience stores; sawmill and wood products; cement manufacturing; and an electrical workers union.  Most are optimistic about business profits, although all noted growing regulatory burdens, leading some of them for the first time in their company history to add regulatory compliance departments and staffing.  A number of them highlighted the direct or indirect effects of the government shutdown on their businesses, focusing particularly on heightened uncertainty and lower confidence levels.  And, finally, contacts expressed concerns that they were experiencing now, or would soon experience, shortages of skilled labor in trade professions as construction activity continues to pick up.  Turning to the national economy, my overall assessment is largely unchanged from September.  The challenge, as others have noted, over the next few months will be to sort through the likely temporary shifts in employment related to the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate and to assess the underlying momentum for the economy.  When I look at the August 2011 debt ceiling crisis as a proxy, I note that the three-month moving average of monthly payroll growth slowed from 210,000 in June to 140,000 in August.  And yet within three months the measure of employment growth bounced back to 190,000, and it further accelerated to 270,000 by February 2012.  Measures of consumer confidence followed a similar pattern, down sharply in August 2011 but back to earlier peaks by February 2012.   As I look beyond current fiscal headwinds and disruptions, my outlook for the labor market continues to improve.  I would note that the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ one-year-ahead forecast for nonfarm payroll growth was 149,000 in the third quarter of 2012, and it is now 181,000.  I expect inflation to pick up in the second half of this year and next year as labor market conditions continue to improve, private demand strengthens, and inflation expectations remain stable.   And, finally, a comment on banking conditions based on banking contacts’ and supervisory staff’s feedback:  I continue to watch the challenges that the banking industry faces around these extraordinarily low interest rates as their net interest margins compress and the search for yield continues.  Among smaller banks, I see renewed interest in commercial real estate lending, with particularly stiff competition resulting in longer maturities and fixed rates.  Among larger banks, a sizable release of reserves related to better asset quality now suggests very thin coverage of future losses at a time when lending to commercial and industrial customers is growing, and some of those quite leveraged.  Results of our shared national creditreview and the Senior Loan Officers Opinion Survey corroborate some of these concerns.  Of course, I see plenty of evidence that examiners have this in focus, but to stem the tide of search-for-yield incentives will be difficult as long as this low-rate environment persists.  Thank you.

Passage number 92.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our survey indexes haven’t changed much in the past month.  Manufacturing numbers are essentially flat, and our services numbers remain positive without much change.  Our anecdotal reports are generally consistent with the sense that little has changed, with the exception of widespread reports of slowing activity in the D.C. area due to the government slowdown, but these are not at all inconsistent with the staff assessment reported by David Lebow—essentially that this will be virtually entirely a transitory affair.  We have also heard reports of some offsets in the form of increased traffic at private amusement parks, private Civil War sites and museums, hardware stores, and fishing supply stores, where the increase in weekday traffic was particularly noted.   In addition, we have heard a lot from our contacts about the fallout from the Affordable Care Act.  There have been many reports of employers’ keeping staff levels under 50 and cutting employees’ hours to under 30.  In fact, we heard of a pair of franchises that were arranging to share some full-time employees to keep them under 30 hours each at each firm.  More broadly, many contacts reported that the ACA was having a chilling effect on business because of the general uncertainty about its implementation.   We have also heard ubiquitous reports of shortages of skilled labor from our contacts.  In addition to the usual stories about IT workers, many reports center on skilled trades, such as maritime maintenance, sewer workers, pipefitters, auto mechanics, plumbers, and carpenters. Contacts say that the entry of younger workers is not keeping up with the need to replace retiring workers. Turning to the national economy, this Tealbook’s narrative is a familiar one.  First, it acknowledges that real economic growth has not been as strong as had been predicted.  Second, it pulls down the near-term forecast.  And, third, it reiterates that growth will pick up significantly within a couple of quarters—in this case, one or two quarters—and will continue at that higher rate for several more years.  But real GDP growth was 2.0 percent in 2011, 2.0 percent in 2012, and is now predicted to be 2.0 percent in 2013.  I recognize that reasonable people can disagree on the relative weight to place on recent experience versus the more distant past, years when significantly higher growth rates were more typical, but for me the current data loom large. The staff prepared a very helpful memo for this meeting providing more detail on the underpinnings of their forecast of an acceleration in consumer spending.  I very much appreciated the additional insight into their thinking.  While the story hangs together given the underlying premises, I find myself unpersuaded by the premises.  One key driver of the acceleration is improvement in consumer optimism.  This has been commented on around the table so far.  This is an intangible factor that forecasts are inherently subjective on, so a wide range of views are possible.  Another premise of the acceleration-around-the-bend hypothesis is the pickup in growth in real disposable income.  Some of this represents anticipated fiscal policy shifts, but the bulk appears to stem from a persistent pickup in productivity growth in the Tealbook, as I was asking about earlier.  Growth in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 0.7 percent per year for the past three years, and the Tealbook has it averaging 1.7 percent for the next three years.  To me, productivity growth seems likely to be 0.7in the years ahead rather than 1.7, particularly given the extent of anecdotal reports of regulatory impediments to investment and economic growth. All of this leads me to believe that consumer spending is unlikely to accelerate much at all in the near term.  And outside of consumer spending, it’s difficult to find any other components of demand that are likely to fuel a significant pickup in top-line economic growth.  As a result, my outlook is very much like the projection I sent in for the most recent SEP, which had growth at only slightly above 2 percent for next year and beyond.  I think we need to take very seriously for our policy deliberations the possibility that growth continues to come in at 2 percent.  If we get 2 percent rather than the acceleration projected by the Tealbook and others, I think it’s likely to be because productivity doesn’t accelerate to the late-20th-century average.  If so, I don’t think 2 percent growth should be taken as any sort of monetary policy failure.  And tying balance sheet policies to a pickup in growth that may never come may keep us on a hamster wheel of asset purchases for a long time to come.  Thank you.

Passage number 94.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I certainly don’t want to stay on a hamster wheel.  [Laughter]  That doesn’t sound very attractive. I don’t have much to add to what has already been said.  On the economic growth side, we still seem stuck around 2 percent, as President Lacker has said.  And this pickup that most of us anticipate has not yet been realized.  It remains a forecast.  Focusing on the growth side of the ledger, I am a bit disappointed by the recent data, to the extent that we have data.  Three areas have gotten my attention.  First, payroll employment growth appears to have slowed, even before the effects of the government shutdown.  Second, it looks like the earlier rise in mortgage rates has taken some of the zip out of housing.  I’m particularly struck by the weakness in pendinghome sales.  And, third, capital spending is a bit weaker than I would have anticipated, given the favorable fundamentals of the corporate sector—a high level of profitability, very liquid balance sheets, and readily available credit at low interest rates.  In particular, with respect to capital goods orders, the most recent durable goods orders report was quite weak when you look past the big upsurge in aircraft orders. Now, all of that said, prospectively, I am still becoming more optimistic, once again.  First, financial conditions have eased significantly over the past few months.  Longer-term interest rates are down, stock prices are up, and the dollar is a bit softer.  Second, it appears that credit availability is improving.  This is evident not only in the results of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, but also in my conversations with some of the smaller but well-established businesses in my District, who say that the banks are now tripping over themselves in their willingness to do business.  Third, we have had a recent drop in gasoline prices, and that will help support real disposable income growth.  Fourth—and this is one I say with great trepidation—I do think the risk of another debt ceiling debacle has fallen, given the negative political consequences for those who have wanted to use it as a weapon.  We’ll see if that turns out to be right or not, but that’s my presumption.  And, fifth, every month we get a little bit further through this period of significant fiscal restraint.  As the staff has noted, the fiscal restraint in 2014 will be roughly half of what we experienced in 2013.  As the degree of fiscal restraint wanes, I think that should lead to a somewhat stronger growth pace.  So despite my having been wrong before, I continue to expect that economic growth will be a bit faster in 2013. On inflation, given the delay in the release schedule caused by the government shutdown, there is very little new information since the previous meeting.  But I will look at the Billion Prices data set.  Anecdotally, when I talk to businesspeople, there seems to be very little pricepressure in terms of inputs or in terms of their ability to raise the prices on outputs, and the situation doesn’t really seem to have changed materially in recent months.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 96.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It’s challenging to make monetary policy in the fog, and at the moment that fog is especially dense.  The latest employment report did show an upward revision to the rather tepid payroll gains originally reported for August.  Even so, the pace of monthly payroll gains shows a worrisome downward trend:  185,000 over the past 12 months, 163,000 over the past six, and 143,000 over the past three.  The unemployment rate in September rounded down one-tenth from August, but the participation rate failed to reverse any of its earlier declines.  Given the noise that the government shutdown will introduce into the next employment report, it may be some time before we get a clearer read on whether the slowing we are seeing in the pace of labor market improvement is just a temporary step down along a path that will eventually exhibit greater momentum, as in the Tealbook baseline, or whether the data instead portend a more lasting shift to a scenario of slower progress. In June, the central tendency of our GDP growth projections for the second half of 2013 was about 2¾ percent.  Now the Tealbook projects just 2¼ percent, and only a small portion of this downward revision is due to the effects of the government shutdown.  Once again, the hope for acceleration appears to have receded into the future.  I recall President Rosengren drawing an analogy to Waiting for Godot in the previous meeting.  This observation is sobering not only because the current state of the labor market is unacceptably weak, but also because of what it says about our ability to forecast the economy’s future course.  It thus raises questions not onlyabout the appropriate stance of policy today, but also about the appropriate conduct of policy in a world characterized by such great uncertainty. At the risk of oversimplifying, perhaps it is useful to consider four scenarios for the economy going forward, all of which, to me, have some plausibility.  In scenario 1, the run of bad luck we have experienced over the past several years is about to end, and we are poised to see a notable pickup in growth along the lines of the Tealbook’s faster-recovery scenario.  In scenario 2, growth picks up as the various headwinds restraining demand abate, but more gradually, as in the Tealbook baseline.  In scenario 3, we are already at the new normal as far as economic growth is concerned because structural damage to the economy from the recession and the financial crisis exceeds that in the baseline.  In this supply-side-damage scenario, the job market, along the lines that President Lacker described, will continue to tighten even absent any meaningful pickup in demand because structural productivity growth has declined.  Finally, in scenario 4, structural productivity growth has not declined, but private spending picks up over time by less than the staff project, a scenario that seems entirely possible given the huge uncertainties surrounding our forecasts of private consumption and investment spending.  In this scenario we remain stuck in the mud, with economic growth continuing at a trendlike pace and little further progress in the labor market. Thoughtful arguments have been made around the table in support of each one of these scenarios.  Of course, like the Tealbook, many of us have been making overly optimistic predictions over the past several years.  Although there are some tangible factors we can point to, such as the European economic and financial situation and the course of federal fiscal policy in the U. S., I believe it’s fair to say that we do not fully understand why growth has remained so persistently slow.  My own modal outlook follows scenario 2, something similar to the Tealbook baseline.  I see the economy developing momentum, but only gradually and only in a context in which monetary policy continues to provide accommodation for a long time.  To be sure, I’m quite uncertain about this outlook, as it reflects more a tendency to draw inferences from past forecast errors than any clearly articulated view of exactly why aggregate demand is picking up so slowly. The other scenarios that I outlined also seem possible.  For example, as the staff have noted, the fact that growth of gross domestic income has outpaced GDP growth suggests that demand may already have picked up more than we recognize.  The structural-damage scenario also strikes me as a realistic possibility.  It is entirely plausible that the weak productivity growth we have seen since 2010 reflected at least in part the reversal of productivity toward its structural level following outsized gains in 2009.  But if payroll gains continue at the pace we saw last year in the face of only 2 percent GDP growth, could that still reflect catch-up.  The longer productivity keeps growing in the 1 percent range, the greater the likelihood that we may find ourselves in a world similar to that characterized in the supply-side-damage scenario of the Tealbook.  Scenario 4 is, to me, the most worrisome possibility.  There, productivity growth does pick up, but GDP growth does not, and the pattern of improvement we have seen in the labor market over the past year continues to stall out. Given the plausibility of all these scenarios, we need to ensure that policy will be appropriately positioned no matter which one unfolds.  In this respect, our current plans with respect to asset purchases and our threshold-based forward guidance work reasonably well, as I see it, in the first three scenarios.  If the headwinds lift more rapidly—scenario 1—we will be able to wind down the asset purchase plan as envisioned in June, and if unemployment reaches6½ percent sooner than we anticipate, we could begin to remove accommodation sooner than in the baseline, as would be appropriate.  In scenario 2—the Tealbook baseline—our current plan to taper asset purchases as more evidence accumulates that we are on track and to maintain an accommodative policy for some time thereafter will get us back to our full employment and inflation goals, although the projected pace of progress is quite slow.  If slow productivity growth continues because of structural damage—scenario 3—our plan should also work.  The labor market would continue to improve even though growth may not pick up, but we can taper asset purchases as we see that progress, and if unemployment declines quickly, it would likely also be appropriate to remove accommodation sooner than in the baseline. What worries me most is scenario 4, in which we’re stuck in the mud and progress stalls, because here the risks of stagnation and disinflation are significant, and policy does not seem appropriately positioned right now to respond.  In particular, we may not then be able to end our asset purchase program with a declaration of victory, and the outlook, absent further policy measures, would be unacceptably weak.  Tomorrow I will reflect a bit more on how we might respond to such a scenario.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents different scenarios for the economy's future course and suggests that there is uncertainty and disagreement among policymakers about which scenario is most likely to occur.


Passage number 97.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Thank you. Governor Tarullo" simply expresses gratitude towards Governor Tarullo without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 98.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think a good many of the interventions in this go-round have continued the theme of the past several meetings of asking two questions.  The first is:  How much underlying momentum is there in the economy for faster economic growth in the near to medium term.  And the second is:  To the degree that momentum is lacking, what’s the relative persuasiveness of explanations based on some form of structural damage—which is presumably not susceptible to repair through monetary policy—as opposed to continuing or post-crisis headwinds, which monetary policy accommodation should be able tooffset, at least in part.  I agree with those of you who have already suggested that there may not be a whole lot that is useful to add to explanations on either of those questions since the previous meeting.  It’s only been six weeks.  Some of the relevant data are unavailable or potentially inaccurate because of the shutdown, and it’s likely that the shutdown and fiscal cliff dramas themselves have affected economic activity and confidence. I actually didn’t feel as though there was much useful that I could add in terms of economic analysis at this meeting.  In fact, it was kind of summed up for me last week when I was in a supervisory meeting at which senior managers of a large financial firm observed that there was a noticeable uptick in inquiries from clients on both IPO and M&A activity.  And then as soon as that was noted, the senior managers themselves began to disagree as to whether this interest would actually ripen into a lot of deals and whether, even if it did, those potential deals were a one-time surge that had built up over some longer period or the beginning of a steadier flow of transactions.  At that point I just became the observer as these people within the same firm argued back and forth, and after about 10 or 12 minutes, they all agreed that they’d have to wait a few months to make a more informed judgment because everything recently was sort of distorted. So I thought about using this time to address areas—labor market or housing or business investment topics—that are less dependent on current information, but because I’m going to have a good bit more to say during the second go-round, I’ll stop here on the theory that it does one’s colleagues a service not to say much if there’s not much useful to say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is acknowledging that there may not be much useful information to add to the discussion at the current meeting due to a lack of available data and the potential impact of recent events on economic activity and confidence. The speaker also mentions observing a disagreement among senior managers at a financial firm, but this is not a disagreement within the passage itself.


Passage number 99.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply expresses gratitude towards Governor Stein.


Passage number 100.
MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The current picture and recent news seem to be, as many people have said, somewhere between mixed and tepid.  I won’t try to review the particulars, because they’ve been well explored by others. Looking forward, my baseline outlook is broadly similar to the Tealbook in that I’m still holding to my belief in unicorns and faster economic growth in 2014.  But for the purposes of thinking about policy, I thought about it very much as Governor Yellen did, which is that the interesting and challenging scenario for us to spend time thinking about is the one where the next six to nine months evolve kind of like the previous period, where there’s this muddle, and we have this difficult identification problem—is it structural, is it demand.  It’s really hard to tell when things are just not going all that well.  And given that:  What are we going to do in December.  What are we going to do in March.  What are we going to do in June.  I think the answer is pretty clear for December at this point—that we will be sitting tight.  I think as we get toward March, this muddle scenario becomes a really interesting and open set of questions, and as President Lockhart said, I think this is where we’re going to have to really be very deft. I want to mention very briefly one specific issue with regard to the issue of deftness.  Whenever we get to the point to start talking about tapering again, what might this do to markets.  How much of a further leg up in rates might it cause.  What might that, in turn, mean for our ability to pull the trigger.  In other words, the now famous market dynamics that were unleashed in May and June—are we going to revisit those.  On the one hand, if you think about it in terms of the level of rates or term premiums, I think you draw a fair amount of comfort.  In other words, rates are still—even though they’ve backed down a bit—substantially higher than they were in May.  So if you think that that’s the measure of froth, I think you could feel quite a bit more comfortable about where we are.  On the other hand, I’ve been wondering if there’s anyindependent information in the fact that interest rate volatility as implied in swaptions has actually come down quite significantly since the September meeting.  What might that do to the willingness of various market players to take on leverage, to reengage in carry trades, and all of that. This is obviously hard to do systematically.  On the notion that the plural of anecdote is data, I looked at eight of the research reports put out by the broker–dealers in the last month on rates.  It’s interesting.  It’s just a collection of stories, but the uniform theme that comes across very, very strongly in these eight reports is that the levered-yield-curve carry trade seems to be back, at least as an item of discussion.  To be clear, these eight reports were divided on what they were telling their clients to do.  Five of them said, “You should max out on the carry trade, five to seven years; take leverage, do that.”  The other three said, “Don’t do that.  Everybody else is doing that, and if you do that, you’re going to get hurt.”  So there’s no implied investment advice in any of this, but it was clear that this was a topic of conversation.  Again, you take this all with a fairly large grain of salt, and even if I was sure it was right, I don’t mean to suggest that there’s a clear-cut normative implication for what we should do.  I think it’s just a way of underscoring what Dennis said earlier.  It’s going to be an environment where we’re going to have to be pretty deft because I think as we go along longer, especially if we go out to March, there’s just going to be more of this kind of uncertainty built up in the markets—uncertainty from our perspective as to how markets will respond to anything we do.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is a discussion of the current economic situation and the potential actions that will be taken by the Federal Reserve in response. The speaker acknowledges that there are mixed opinions and uncertainties, but there is no clear disagreement or contention.


Passage number 101.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Nobody does that trade anymore.  It’s too crowded.  [Laughter]  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement followed by laughter.


Passage number 102.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My conversations with bankers and other business executives and financial market participants suggest continued gradual improvement inconditions.  Not one of my correspondents offered a narrative of significant improvement, nor did anyone see significant weakening in conditions.  On the other hand, many offered negative comments about the course of events in Washington, and there was a division between those who saw the shutdown and the debt ceiling standoff as having hurt their results and those who did not.  It is not at all implausible to me that there will be another confrontation over the debt ceiling early in the new year.  For those who engineered the last confrontation, maybe not much has changed.  I would agree with Bill that the likelihood of such a confrontation has fallen, but I actually think it is higher than people think it is.  Turning to the data, at the time of the September meeting there was some evidence of weakening in the economy.  And since then, in my view, at the margin there are additional signs of weakness as, perhaps, more accommodative financial conditions have not quite offset the drag from the confrontation. I believe that there has been significant progress in the labor markets since September 2012, and for me payroll gains in the range of 150,000 to 175,000 would be sufficient for a taper in the right circumstances.  Nonetheless, if you look at the private payroll numbers, private payrolls were about 212,000 per month in the first quarter, 190,000 in the second quarter, and 129,000 in the third quarter.  And there is no denying that that is troubling.  My own version of the unicorn that Governor Stein referred to is wondering whether there isn’t a remaining element of the seasonal adjustment algorithm problem that we talked about in the past couple of years, which would suggest that payrolls should strengthen as we go into the cold months.  I want to believe that; I guess we’ll see. The narrative around higher economic growth in 2014, on the other hand, depends, as it must, on a significant increase in consumer spending.  And like others, I thought that the memoon the staff forecast for PCE by Andrew Figura and Geng Li was very well done and useful in thinking about this issue.  My own takeaway is that there are plenty of good reasons—and they are set forth pretty clearly in the back end of the memo—why consumption may remain on a lower trajectory than that included in the forecast.  I would include uncertainty about the effects of increasing house prices, lingering concerns about future income, uncertainty about government fiscal and regulatory policy, and rising inequality.  I thought that the consumer restraint alt-sim captured that scenario pretty well.  And I would echo Governor Yellen’s and others’ concerns that that is really the troubling situation, and I have to say it’s not at all unlikely. My bottom line is that I am not inclined to change my September SEP forecast of 2 percent growth for 2013, modestly increasing to about 2½ percent in 2014.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 104.
 MR. TETLOW.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the handout titled “Material for Policy Planning.”  Turning first to forward guidance, as noted in the box at the top of the first exhibit, the Committee may wish to consider adding an inflation floor to its forward guidance for the federal funds rate to signal its commitment to price stability when inflation is unusually low.  Importantly, because an inflation floor would be an addition to existing forward guidance, which already includes an inflation threshold, an inflation floor would not amend prior commitments and could clarify that the Committee is committed to defending its inflation objective both from above and from below. The model-based analysis in the memo suggests that an inflation floor of 1½ percent would produce economic benefits more often than not, but those benefits are likely to be small.  In the stochastic simulations, the floor is binding in only about one-fourth of the draws, and in only about one-half of the cases where it is binding does it shift out the liftoff date for the federal funds rate by more than one quarter.  That said, those simulations in which the inflation floor is particularly helpful—ones in which inflation is low, of course, but also when the unemployment rate stalls near its threshold value—are simulations in which losses without the floor are high.  Accordingly, an inflation floor might be best thought of as a hedge against certain bad states of the economy. With regard to communications, adding an inflation floor would help clarify the symmetry of the FOMC’s inflation objective, but it might also present communications challenges.  To the extent that forward guidance is already complex, the addition of an inflation floor could further tax the public’s understanding.  Moreover, the rollout of an inflation floor could be taken as signaling that the Committee is more worried about inflation remaining persistently low.   The lower panel discusses the provision of more information about the post-liftoff behavior of the federal funds rate.  As you know, monetary conditions today depend on the entire path of the future funds rate, not just the date of liftoff.  Hence, a policy that defers liftoff of the funds rate for longer than otherwise can nevertheless result in a tightening of the stance of monetary policy if the subsequent increase in rates is steeper.  In the staff memo, we examined the implications of committing to a policy for the federal funds rate, for the period after liftoff up to the point when the unemployment rate falls to 5½ percent, that is more inertial than the inertial Taylor rule that we normally use.  We found that this more gradual post-liftoff rule would not likely affect the liftoff date but would result in a more gradual climb in the federal funds rate for some time after liftoff.  This results in small improvements, on average, in economic performance.3 The materials used by Messrs. Tetlow and Clouse are appended to this transcript (appendix 4). Implementation and public communication of such a change in post-liftoff policy would present challenges for the Committee, not the least because that event is likely to be well off in the future.  The meaning of a state-contingent gradual increase in the federal funds rate may be difficult for the public to understand.  At the same time, this addition to forward guidance, if timed appropriately, could be used to draw a distinction between federal funds rate and asset purchase policies. The second page of the handout covers the material on simple policy rules to guide decisions on reducing the pace of asset purchases.  The memo you received on this subject introduced three rules for purchases: one based on the unemployment rate and two others based on changes in payroll employment.  As you know, different measures of labor market conditions can send different signals, which can present pitfalls for simple rules that are written in terms of one variable, to the exclusion of others.  Revisions to the data aside, the choice among these rules matters when the unemployment rate and payroll gains co-move unusually.  If recent declines in the labor force participation rate (LFPR) continue, while payroll gains stay near current levels, the unemployment-based rule would call for faster reductions in LSAPs than would the payroll-based rules.  But if recent declines in the LFPR are largely cyclical and are reversed, the unemployment-based rule might call for slower reductions, even if payroll gains are strong. Communicating an LSAP policy rule would present some challenges for the Committee, some of which are summarized in the bullets at the bottom of the exhibit.  The most obvious concern would be handling conflicts in the signals coming from different labor market indicators.  A second issue is the coordination of an LSAP rule with existing thresholds for the funds rate, at least for employment-based rules.  Under some conditions, those LSAP rules could prescribe purchases to continue after the 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold governing funds rate guidance has been crossed.  Based on our stochastic simulations, we computed the likelihood of this occurring to be roughly 7 percent.  A third issue pertains to communication of whether the new rule only allows the pace of purchases to ratchet down.  In the memo, we suggested that these and other obstacles might argue for a measure of vagueness in the initial communication of a rule, vagueness that could be shaped and clarified in longer-form discussions—potentially including press conferences, speeches, and testimony—and through repetition.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents arguments for and against adding an inflation floor to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate. Some argue that it would clarify the Committee's commitment to price stability, while others believe it could confuse the public and signal concern about low inflation. Similarly, there is contention regarding the communication of a post-liftoff policy that is more inertial, with some arguing it could improve economic performance while others raise concerns about public understanding and implementation challenges. Finally, there is discussion about the challenges of communicating an LSAP policy rule and handling conflicts in signals from different labor market indicators.


Passage number 105.
 MR. CLOUSE.  Thanks very much.  I’ll be referring to the bullets on the third page of your packet that summarize two background memos prepared for this meeting: one focusing on possible actions that the FOMC could take to strengthen its forward guidance for the federal funds rate and another focusing on issues the Committee may wish to consider in developing plans for reducing the pace of asset purchases. As noted in the bullets at the left, under the first potential approach to strengthening its forward guidance, the Committee would announce that it is prepared to conduct long-term repurchase agreement operations against all OMO-eligible collateral at a pre-announced fixed rate.  By committing to conduct term repos to afixed end date and over a defined period—for example, until the end of 2014—the Committee would likely put a cap on term repo rates and provide dealers with certainty about their financing costs for a considerable period.  Arbitrage by dealers should then tend to drive down yields on any shorter-term Treasury securities whose yields initially exceed the Federal Reserve’s term repo rate.  However, market participants have noted that balance sheet constraints of various types may limit this arbitrage process to some degree. In a second alternative, the Federal Reserve would simply announce that it stands ready to purchase shorter-term Treasury securities, perhaps those with maturities prior to the end of 2014, at a price corresponding to a pre-established yield of, say, 20 basis points.  By purchasing all eligible securities offered at this pre-announced rate, the Federal Reserve would establish a cap on short-term Treasury yields.  In a variation of this approach, the FOMC would not attempt to establish a formal cap on yields but rather would conduct operations as necessary to try to prevent the path of short-term rates from departing significantly from the Committee’s policy intentions. As discussed in the memo, choosing the end dates for such date-based programs in a way that is consistent with the FOMC’s threshold-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate presents some challenges.  For example, while the current staff forecast suggests that the thresholds in the FOMC’s forward guidance will not be crossed until mid-2015, one of the thresholds could be crossed considerably earlier if the economy were to strengthen substantially.  In such a scenario, the Federal Reserve might need to end these programs earlier than originally announced, and market uncertainty about whether programs such as these would remain in place could undermine their effectiveness. Alternatively, the FOMC could announce that it stands ready to conduct overnight repo operations at a predetermined rate as long as the economic thresholds have not been crossed.  For example, the Desk could commit to conducting overnight repos with the primary dealers at a fixed rate of 20 basis points until one of the thresholds is crossed.  This type of program should put a cap of 20 basis points on overnight repo rates.  Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could sell options that provide the holder with the right to participate in overnight repos with the Federal Reserve at a pre-established rate until one of the thresholds is crossed.  Threshold-based programs such as these would address the difficulty with the fixed end dates discussed in the first two alternatives but would require being very clear, ex ante, about what would constitute “crossing a threshold.” Under a fourth program, analogous to the foreign exchange operations of some central banks, the Federal Reserve could conduct operations in the forward market for Treasury securities.  For example, the Federal Reserve could contract today to purchase six-month Treasury bills one year from now at a price agreed upon today.  Such operations would allow the Federal Reserve to address pressures at particular points on the yield curve without expanding its balance sheet in the near term.  This type of operation could be conducted in various ways and, similar to alternative 2, might allow the FOMC to follow a fairly flexible approach in addressing unwarrantedupward pressures on short-term yields.  A program like this would require careful consideration of technical issues, such as a process for establishing appropriate margins for such forward positions. As a final alternative, the first memo also discussed the possibility of lowering the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) and, at the same time, implementing a standing overnight reverse repurchase facility with no size limits.  For example, the IOER could be lowered to 15 basis points, and the rate on the overnight reverse repurchase facility could be set at perhaps 5 basis points.  Cutting the IOER would put downward pressure on the federal funds rate and many other money market rates, while the overnight reverse repurchase rate would establish a firmer floor on money market rates.  This action would amount to a modest easing in the stance of monetary policy and could have important signaling effects on expected future levels of short-term rates.  As noted in previous staff memos, a full-scale overnight reverse repurchase program could help address strains in financing markets that would otherwise push repo rates below zero, but it could also have implications for activity in the federal funds market and for dealer financing. As a final note, various policy, legal, and operational issues would need to be addressed before implementing any of these programs.  The staff could do more analysis of such issues for any of the alternatives that are of interest to policymakers. The second staff memo reviewed a number of factors that the FOMC may wish to consider in developing plans for reducing the pace of asset purchases.  The memo discussed the benefits and costs of alternative time paths for reductions in the pace of total asset purchases, and the benefits and costs of trimming the monthly purchases of either Treasury securities or MBS more quickly than the other, along any given path for total asset purchases. In staff models, the effect of LSAPs on market yields stems from investors’ expectations for the current and future stock of longer-term Treasury securities and MBS available to the public.  And in this framework, small variations in alternative paths for reductions in the pace of total asset purchases or in the composition of asset purchases should have only modest effects on yields.  Nonetheless, as noted in the bullets at the right, the FOMC might prefer to announce a modest initial reduction in the pace of asset purchases, rather than a large initial reduction, as a way to signal that further reductions in the pace of asset purchases are likely to be gradual.  Policymakers might also favor this approach if they judged that it could mitigate the potential for an outsized market reaction to the first reduction in the pace of purchases. On issues related to the composition of reductions in asset purchases, the memo notes several considerations that could argue for initially trimming monthly purchases of one asset class by more than the other, along any given path for total asset purchases.  For example, a decision to pare the pace of Treasury purchases relatively rapidly while maintaining a somewhat higher path for MBS securities might be viewed as a way to signal the Committee’s continued strong interest in fosteringrecovery in the housing market.  It might also be appropriate if the FOMC views purchases of MBS to be a somewhat more powerful tool than purchases of Treasury securities.  Alternatively, the FOMC might prefer to reduce its pace of MBS purchases relatively more rapidly than Treasuries if it believed that elevated purchases in the MBS market could have important adverse consequences for market functioning or if MBS purchases were viewed as more likely to result in credit misallocations.  Of course, the Committee might prefer to cut purchases of Treasuries and agency MBS in roughly equal increments; that approach seems to be about what markets expect and, as noted in the memo, would allow for the gradual reduction in the pace of purchases for both types of securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a summary of different potential actions and alternatives for strengthening the Federal Reserve's forward guidance and reducing the pace of asset purchases. The passage simply presents different options and considerations for policymakers to consider.

Passage number 112.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Bullard.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 113.
 MR. BULLARD.  I have one question for President Evans, because this idea of tapering but then strengthening forward guidance at the same time has been kicked around the Committee before.  Are you worried at all that this would send a conflicting signal.  You want to pull back, but you don’t want to pull back.  Are you worried about that at all, or not really.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The statement by Mr. Bullard suggests that there may be conflicting signals being sent by the idea of tapering while also strengthening forward guidance. This indicates a disagreement or concern about the potential consequences of the proposal.


Passage number 114.
MR. EVANS.  I’ve learned to worry about more of this ever since we came to recognize that our communications haven’t always had the follow-through that we expected.  So, yes, that’s true.  I’ve taken on board that there is more of a unidimensional aspect to what we’re trying to do than just the plain language of, “We’ve got two tools.  We can use them differently at different times.”  The markets haven’t really been willing to embrace that.  I think what they are doing is trying to guess what our true resolve is, which is what I tried to talk about at the beginning.  That single principal component in terms of our ultimate resolve to follow through is what’s most important.  Therefore, if we get to the point where tapering makes sense and we make that adjustment, I fear that the markets will think of that as being on a path to an ultimately more restrictive balance sheet.  And if we then offer them this strengthening to say that we intend our forward guidance to indicate that we’re going to be in it for longer, that could be helpful.  That’s how I think about it, and I can’t say it would happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing their concerns and thoughts about the markets' response to their actions, but there is no argument or disagreement presented.


Passage number 115.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  I appreciate it.

Passage number 116.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only mentions President Kocherlakota without providing any information or context about him or any actions or statements he may have made, so there is no clear contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 117.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  To build on this conversation, which I think is really at the heart of the matter in a lot of ways, President Evans refers to a point in time when it’s right to taper but, at the same time, it’s also right to strengthen forward guidance.  I think that, at such a point in time, it’s very hard to explicate that economic conditions can justify both at the same time, unless we follow up on what President Lockhart referred to, explaining why the two tools really are different in terms of some other feature beyond our dual mandate considerations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing and building on a previous conversation.


Passage number 118.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s an important point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the statement "That's an important point." It is simply acknowledging the significance of a certain point without expressing any opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 119.
 MR. EVANS.  I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not demonstrate any contention or disagreement. The speaker explicitly states that they agree with the statement made by someone else.


Passage number 120.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would just get the Committee’s sense.  If we went to 6:00 and left whatever remained for tomorrow morning, would that be okay with everybody.  So another hour, and let me turn to President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a suggestion and request for input from the Committee.


Passage number 121.

Passage number 133.
MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to also align myself with those who think that simpler is better.  I think that should guide us as we look at this.  For me, the communication challenge we face is really less about convincing markets that LSAPs and forward guidance are separate policy tools and more about clarifying the sequencing of our future actions relative to those tools.  Because of that, the staff’s work, which was very helpful in thinking about this, made me wonder if it would be worthwhile to return to the discussion that we had in June about the path or guidelines for policy normalization.  For example, if markets now believe that we might wait until March to start adjusting purchases and then end them late next year, at a time when the unemployment rate could be quite close to 6½ percent, I think having more daylight between the end of purchases and the 6½ percent threshold is important if we want to move deliberately and carefully toward the first rate hike. We will likely want a period when we hold the balance sheet constant and then cease reinvestments, which are accompanied or shortly followed by temporary reserve-draining operations.  These shifts in our balance sheet and operations carry some risk in terms of how markets will respond, and so, for that reason, I have felt that starting to adjust LSAPs sooner would give us more time to properly lay the groundwork before the first rate hike and help mitigate the possibility of a sharp rise in longer-term rates, which could threaten the recovery and financial stability.  These considerations and communications suggest to me that it may be worthwhile for the Committee to reconsider the discussion we had earlier and talk about the sequencing of those steps. Relative to the ideas that the staff raised in their memos, let me start with forward guidance.  In terms of our communication strategy and forward guidance, it is tempting, as some have noted, to remodel that guidance as a way to provide more emphasis on its intent.  But itseems to me that guidance works best if it is consistent and often repeated, and so making changes at this point seems counterproductive.  Every time we change our guidance, markets must reassess the implications for policy and ask why we changed it, which then increases uncertainty and could raise questions about credibility.  This is particularly important because a diverse group of consumers and investors can easily interpret our actions in many different ways, particularly in ways that can be contrary to our intentions. Given the risk in adjusting forward guidance, I think we should approach the issue of adding an inflation floor cautiously.  Under the right circumstances, I could support its intent.  At this point, though, I would not want to send a message that our risk assessment that inflation will fall further has increased, especially given that we have seen some modest upward movement in core PCE inflation.  Should we see further broad-based slowing in prices, though, adding the inflation floor to signal our commitment to achieving our target may be effective.  I do not favor using targeted market interventions, as such actions move us into further attempts at fine-tuning and are likely to distort the information content and signals from markets regarding expectations for monetary policy.  To me, it is unclear how this would improve communication.  Right now, markets expect liftoff to occur after the 6½ percent threshold is reached, so they do not question our commitment to follow through with the current threshold-based guidance.  In addition, the expected path of the funds rate should move in response to our communications, LSAP expectations, and changes in the outlook.  Expecting LSAPs to surgically operate only on the term premium seems unrealistic, and I prefer other strategies to address this.  In terms of cutting IOER, I am open to this, although, as others have noted, we’ve left that option on the table for several years now, and to raise it at this point by pairing it with more-   aggressive use of the overnight reverse repo facility could send some mixed messages and offer yet another communication challenge. Regarding LSAP rules, I support rules-based, systematic policy reactions, but I believe that any rule should exploit the connection between the instrument we’re adjusting and the target we are trying to hit.  The connection between LSAPs and any measure of labor markets, including the unemployment rate or employment growth, especially at such a short horizon, strikes me as rather weak.  Instead, I think we should simply try to be clear with the public and markets about when we anticipate the start of tapering, because that is likely to elicit the strongest market reaction.  If we try to state a reaction function for asset purchases, which is not fully understood, then we may also be expected to provide a reaction function for the fed funds rate. In terms of the mix of assets, I am open to any of the options.  I could support a decision to adjust the mix based on some research that suggests that the benefits of Treasury purchases are modest.  Once tapering begins, reducing Treasury purchases quickly would probably do little to tighten broader financial conditions. I also like the idea of trying to use the SEP to provide balance sheet guidance.  I think there is an opportunity to talk about the appropriate timing for ending asset purchases, similar to how we do appropriate timing of policy firming.  And I will stop with that.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. Ms. George is expressing her opinions and preferences on various topics related to communications and policy, but there is no direct disagreement or argument being made.


Passage number 134.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude from President Pianalto.


Passage number 135.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to thank the staff for their good work on the memos that were prepared for this policy planning discussion. Before I lay out answers to the questions that were posed, let me take a moment to give a general overview of my position.  I am supportive of taking actions that will reinforce ourmessage that policy is and will remain highly accommodative.  However, in light of my outlook that the economy will continue to improve, I do not see a need to take actions that would add accommodation.  In addition, while our asset purchases do not appear to have had negative effects on market functioning or financial stability thus far, in my mind, the potential longer-run risks continue to grow with the size of the balance sheet.  How we reduce our asset purchases, how we communicate our plans, and how we assure the public of our commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy after we end our asset purchase program do pose immense challenges, and the events of this past summer make those challenges clear.  Thus, I believe that our path forward should be governed by a dominant principle, and that is simplicity, as several others have already suggested. Applying this principle of simplicity, I strongly favor some type of simple rule for asset purchase reductions that can be easily communicated to the public.  I know that a simple rule is unlikely to be the first-best option, but a simple rule may still give us the economic results we desire.  A simple rule facilitates clarity and enables the public and financial markets to form reasonably accurate expectations.  Moreover, with markets already expecting us to proceed in a pretty simple way, ratifying those expectations may be beneficial, especially in light of the communication challenges we had this summer.  Along many dimensions, we are at a juncture where a simple, easily explained, second-best policy rule probably dominates a complex first-best solution that would be difficult to implement. Similarly, I would favor simple and reasonable adjustments to our forward guidance to ease concerns about a premature tightening of policy.  However, I do not think it is a good idea to change the thresholds in our forward guidance, because doing so could make markets doubt whether we will actually carry through with what we say, thus reducing the effectiveness of thatguidance.  For maximum effect, I believe that any adjustment to our forward guidance should be timed to coincide with the announcement of our first reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  For example, the proposed language in alternative B, paragraph 6, would be a good addition to our statement when we announce that the pace of asset purchases will be adjusted.  Timed in this way, this adjustment to our forward guidance could help separate asset purchases and short-term interest rates in the eyes of the public by emphasizing that we have not pulled in our expected path of the funds rate. So with those ideas as a guide, let me briefly answer the questions that were posed.  Regarding the first question, imposing a 1½ percent floor on projected inflation seems like a sensible option to enhance and reinforce forward guidance.  If we are projecting such low inflation, it is unlikely that we would begin to raise the fed funds rate target anyway.  So this floor is intuitive.  As I just mentioned, the best time to make any adjustment to the funds rate guidance would be coincident with the first adjustment in asset purchases. For the second question, I do not see targeted market interventions as being appropriate at this juncture.  Many of the options in the memo move away from my desire for simplicity to enhance communications.  In addition, some options border less on reinforcing guidance and more on adding a slight amount of accommodation, and I do not think the two concepts are synonymous. Regarding IOER, in the third question, I have previously been open to a cut in the IOER rate.  However, it is not clear whether such a cut would really provide much signal about the Committee’s intention to keep rates low well into the future.  In fact, adding ever so slightly more accommodation by cutting the IOER could create noise if markets interpret the cut as a signal of pessimism about the outlook on the part of the Committee.In terms of asset purchase guidance, in question 4, I would strongly favor a simple rule, as I just said, to guide reductions in asset purchases.  Linking asset purchase reductions with decreases in the unemployment rate, as Governor Stein has previously suggested, appears to be the best option, but I could also support other mechanical rules, such as a rule linked to payrolls that does not require unrealistic payroll gains.  What is most important to me is that we begin the process of adjusting our asset purchases.   For the mix of purchases, in question 5, I would be inclined toward an approach that is simple and aligned with market expectations to avoid possible communication problems.  The simplest solution would be to make modest, simultaneous downward reductions in both Treasuries and MBS at each step.  That said, I recognize that a case might be made for initially reducing Treasury purchases more than MBS purchases, based on our larger role in the MBS market. Finally, the sixth question asks about other enhancements to communications.  Here I would suggest that we learn from previous experience.  In my view, some of our past communication enhancements have solved the problems at hand, but they have not always proven to be robust to future developments.  In light of this experience, I suggest that we try to evaluate how proposed communication solutions would hold up under some alternative economic scenarios.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 139.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  Yet another reason for a deeper discussion. A third alternative was to commit to overnight RPs at a predetermined rate until the threshold was crossed.  But my interpretation of the motivation of this discussion is to help people understand how long we think it will be until the thresholds are crossed, not our degree ofcommitment about what we’ve said we would do until the thresholds are crossed.  Committing to doing something different until the thresholds are crossed—it’s not clear that that’s going to change people’s minds about how long it’s going to be until the thresholds are crossed.  So I’m a little puzzled about that.  I think the idea behind forward operations seems to be that we’d take positions that commit us to losing money if short rates go up at some specified time in the future.  We haven’t actually committed not to let rates go up.  Plus, because we’re already pretty well positioned to lose a lot of money if rates go up, I’m not sure how much additional credibility this would buy us. The third question concerns lowering the funds rate when we taper or lower IOER.  I’m skeptical about whether it would help for the reasons someone said.  We would be using one instrument while we’re tapering, which would be perceived as moving another way with another instrument, and that would be confusing.  In addition, the current level of the funds rate doesn’t really say anything to anybody about how long the rate’s going to be low, and I think the disconnect problem is about how long it’s going to be until liftoff.  That’s the major issue of the funds rate curve.  And, if we’re going to lower IOER now, I think it raises a really awkward question as to why we haven’t done this in the last five years.  It’s just a little bit awkward that we haven’t lowered it until now.  If there’s some reason we can point to, then that might be good, but I think that’s awkward. And, finally, regarding the mix of assets, I favor reducing MBS purchases only.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses skepticism and confusion about certain proposals and raises questions about their effectiveness and consistency with past actions.


Passage number 140.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  One rationale is that we have this reverse repo thing now.  That’s one, if you’re looking for a rationale.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that one rationale for something is the existence of a "reverse repo thing." The mention of President Kocherlakota does not indicate disagreement either.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 141.
MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A lot of great things have been said already.  President Fisher asked me to speak until 6:00, but, given how many great things have already been said, it’s going to be hard for me to meet that challenge. I do want to associate myself with the remarks that President Evans made about the main risk that we face, which is that the public and the markets don’t see us as sufficiently committed to sticking with the long program of accommodation that is going to be required to meet our dual mandate objectives.  We continue to be falling short of our dual mandate objectives over the medium term, and I would say that that is one way for us to simplify our communication on an ongoing basis.  In January 2012, we set forth a strategic plan of what we are trying to achieve.  We came back and reaffirmed that strategic plan.  One way to simplify communication is to be making reference to that plan on an ongoing basis as a benchmark for what we’re about.  For example, why would we think about lowering IOER now.  Well, actually, we’re falling short on both of our mandated objectives.  We’re falling short of what we’re trying to achieve as an organization in terms of our strategic direction.  That provides an explanation for why we would take this step of lowering IOER at this time.  I think one way to achieve the simplicity—and I won’t be the one holdout, saying, “Yes, we should get more complicated if we can”; I also favor simplicity—is to be speaking more in terms of our goals and less in terms of the tactical moves that we are forced to confront on a meeting-by-meeting basis.  Now, with that said—that I think we should be trying to be persuasive that we’re in it to win it, and that we’re there to try to get the recovery accomplished and get inflation back to 2 percent—I sense that we are going to want to back away from the asset purchase tool before we have accomplished full employment and before we have gotten back to 2 percent inflation.President Rosengren laid out some arguments for not thinking about costs and efficacy.  I’m actually quite sympathetic to the line of reasoning that Eric put forth, but I do not think it’s commonly shared.  So we have to have a way to talk about this publicly—why is it that we’re going to back away from this tool when we’re still short of our goals.  And this is the problem we faced with our recent communications about near-term tapering.  We’ve been sending the following message:  We’re willing to curtail or reduce monetary accommodation.  Mr. Chairman, despite your third principle, I think reducing the flow of purchases is going to be seen as taking away a tool when the unemployment rate is expected to fall only gradually and the inflation rate is expected to rise only slowly back toward desired levels.  That kind of communication is telling the public that we’re quite comfortable with relatively long-term deviations from our employment and price goals.  It really tells that our strategic plan isn’t that relevant for our thinking about monetary policy.  With that message, it’s not surprising that the markets see it as a very real possibility that we might be willing to raise short-term interest rates relatively soon.  We can fix this communication problem—I think President Lockhart hit on this, and I mentioned this in my last go-round—by being more transparent about how we’re thinking about purchases.  Why are we talking about reducing purchases in the face of a disturbingly weak macroeconomic outlook.  It’s because many around the table have expressed growing discomfort with this unconventional tool in light of their concerns about its costs, its efficacy, and its just general “unknownness.”  That’s not a word, I don’t think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the idea of reducing monetary accommodation and implies that it goes against the organization's strategic plan and goals. They also suggest that the current communication strategy is causing confusion and may lead to the possibility of raising short-term interest rates soon.


Passage number 142.
   MR. EVANS.  It could become one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "It could become one" is simply a continuation of the previous statement without any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 143.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Well, I encourage you to use that at the next press conference.   Yet, when I look at alternative C, I see no mention of efficacy or costs or these general concerns in the proposed justification for tapering.  This lack of clarity about the Committeeparticipants’ concerns about asset purchases means that the public does not have a clear understanding of why we see asset purchases as distinct from the fed funds rate as a tool of monetary policy.  And President Lacker and President Bullard are right—there’s always going to be this inference problem, but we certainly have set ourselves up for magnifying that problem by not saying we see any distinction between these two tools as a way to stimulate aggregate demand. Mr. Chairman, I encourage the staff to recirculate the one-page handout about the asset purchase program that you distributed at the December 2012 meeting.  There were a lot of great things in that handout, but I really like this one terse but, I felt, really apt phrase, which was, “Exiting from the program:  Rhetoric should focus on ongoing evaluation of efficacy and costs.”  I’ve been considerably more long winded today than you were in that handout, but I arrived at that same conclusion.  To make clear that we view asset purchases as a distinct tool from the fed funds rate, our communications about ending the program should emphasize the costs and efficacy considerations associated with this unconventional tool.  To be clear, I’m not saying we should mention only those.  It’s that we’re balancing those off against the dual mandate benefits of using the tools and reaching the conclusion that, given that balancing act, it’s appropriate at this time to curtail the use of this tool. So, as many have done, I’ve had this overall opening statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and suggesting a clearer communication strategy, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 144.
  Let me turn to the staff’s six questions  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota, could I ask for an elaboration.  Let me ask the following question.  I’m just trying to understand your argument.  Part of your argument sounds like, as long as we’re not meeting our targets, we should put all instruments to the max.  Now, that’s not obviously true.  In normal circumstances, with a Taylor rule, we’d putthe interest rate below the neutral rate when we’re not at our objective, but we wouldn’t necessarily go to zero.  So, what if I think about our overall policy thrust as being our rate guidance plus the special thing, the asset purchases, which help us drive the effective rate below zero.  As we move forward in time and as the economy gets better—and we have seen a lot of improvement—why can’t we drop part of the set of tools and still remain highly accommodative.  I’m not saying this is where we are.  I’m just asking, as a theoretical matter, why we couldn’t argue that we have made a lot of progress and the economy has improved enough that we don’t need this additional booster rocket to get, ultimately, to our objective.  I didn’t quite understand that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and asking for more information about the argument being presented.


Passage number 145.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think that’s a great question and a very important question, although I do feel as though we might have switched roles on this discussion in the last two years [laughter]—there’s nothing wrong with that.  But let me try to answer that question.  I think that if we were in a position where the outlook was always consistent with our dual mandate objectives, then we would be responding to the changes in economic conditions as you describe.  But I guess I look back over the past couple of years, and I see a situation where we’ve been falling short on both prices and unemployment.  That seems to call for more accommodation than we currently have in place.  So the reason to say we should be doing the maximum is simply that, given the level of accommodation we have in place—which seems like a lot—we still are falling short of our goals.  That means we want to provide more in order to achieve an even faster rate of improvement toward those objectives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is responding to a question and explaining his viewpoint on the need for more accommodation in order to achieve the Federal Reserve's goals. There is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 146.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But “falling short” doesn’t mean at this moment that we’re short, but rather that you’re assuming we could get to our objectives more quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply clarifying that "falling short" does not indicate a current shortage, but rather implies the possibility of achieving objectives more efficiently.


Passage number 147.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage only provides a statement made by Mr. Kocherlakota, but does not mention any disagreement or contention. Therefore, the answer is no.


Passage number 148.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Our projections do show us reaching our objectives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It states a fact without any conflicting opinions or views being expressed.


Passage number 149.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But I’ll focus on inflation.  They show there that we’re taking five or six years to reach our objectives.  So this would be to facilitate a faster rate of improvement toward those goals.  That’s a better way to say what I was trying to say, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is clarifying and agreeing with the previous statement made by the Chairman.


Passage number 150.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Sorry to interrupt you.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply apologizing for interrupting and giving the other person permission to continue speaking.


Passage number 151.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone referred to as President Fisher.


Passage number 152.
MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I like the phrase “less is more,” but not too long ago, I sent around a memo, if you remember, showing the word count of our statement.  Since we started our unconventional monetary policy, we’ve gone from the mid-250s to 700 or so.  It seems to me that there’s a conflict between transparency, which we wish to achieve—providing a market signal and allowing people to discount what we’re likely to do—and this “less is more” mantra that all of us seem to agree with.  I mention that only because I’m now going to speak more, not less, and I will try to keep it within 700 words.  I know you want to quit at 6:00. And, Eric, I just want to tell you that wounds can heal after two years, because it’s taken me two years to get over what St. Louis did to the Texas Rangers.  I actually agree with President Bullard at this juncture, which I haven’t done for about two years.  So it may be possible for you, if you lose in the World Series, to find some of his arguments appealing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily discusses word count and the speaker's agreement with others.


Passage number 153.
 MR. BULLARD.  Will you just refresh my memory, President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot determine without further context.


Passage number 154.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t think so.  [Laughter]  But it is now 6:00.  I thank everyone for some very thoughtful interventions.  We start tomorrow morning at 9:00.  A reception and dinner are available.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply outlines the schedule and expresses gratitude.


Passage number 155.
  [Meeting recessed]October 30 Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everyone.  To start, let me call on David Lebow to report on data releases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a neutral statement providing an overview of a meeting and calling on someone to give a report on data releases.


Passage number 156.
 MR. LEBOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This morning we received the CPI for September, delayed because of the government shutdown.  The CPI was right in line with our expectations.  The total index rose 0.2 percent.  Ex. food and energy rose 0.1 percent.  So this ought to have no effect on our inflation projection, or on our translation of yesterday’s retail sales data.  This morning we also received the ADP estimate of payrolls in October.  You’ll remember the employment report was scheduled to be released this coming Friday.  It’s been delayed by a week.  The ADP usually comes out two days in advance; the ADP is on its regular schedule.  The ADP showed an increase in private payrolls of 130,000.  Our Tealbook estimate was 135,000, held down 25,000 by some effect of the government shutdown.  So the ADP has limited reliability, but still it was very close to our estimate.  So there were no surprises there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 157.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any questions.  [No response.]  Okay.  Let’s begin this morning by completing our go-round on policy planning, and I have the Vice Chairman first up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply giving instructions and confirming that there are no questions.


Passage number 158.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a simple statement expressing gratitude to Governor Yellen. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 159.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I welcome this opportunity to exchange views on how best to communicate our policy intentions.  As we’ve seen since May, this is a challenging undertaking.  We unfortunately have to recognize that our statements and actions may induce reactions we didn’t anticipate and find difficult to rationalize.  As a general rule, I think we stand the best chance of avoiding needless and harmful volatility if we aspire to clearly articulate how our actions and plans serve to achieve the objectives that we’ve laid out in our consensus statement. Currently, I think we are not in all that bad a place as far as our communications are concerned.  So perhaps the best we can do at this point is to continue to enunciate the key principles of our current policy framework, those you noted in your opening comments yesterday, Mr. Chairman—namely, data dependence, a focus on achieving substantial improvement in the outlook of the labor market retrospectively and prospectively, and the Committee’s view that asset purchases are a separate tool from rates policy so that even as we reduce asset purchases, policy is likely to remain highly accommodative for quite some time.  I think it’s important right now to do no harm by adopting significant changes that might be confusing or disruptive.  Still, things can easily change in the coming months, and this discussion is valuable for the purpose of prudent planning.  I want to thank the staff for an excellent set of background memos for this discussion. Turning to the question of how we might render our forward guidance more robust and effective, I think, first and foremost, we can attempt to clarify aspects of our reaction function that are currently left largely unspecified in our statement.  Specifically, we could explain how we intend to change the federal funds rate target after a threshold is crossed.  In that regard,enumerating several indicators that we’ll be looking at after one of our thresholds has been crossed in deciding when to raise the federal funds rate might be helpful not just in its own right, but also to cement the message that thresholds are not triggers. Because of the unprecedented nature of current circumstances, addition of language as in paragraph B(6) might provide another useful clarification of our reaction function.  It provides a forecast and describes a feature of our reaction function conditional on that forecast.  Given the long string of disappointments pertaining to the pace of recovery, it makes sense to convey that headwinds, including fiscal policy, will likely serve as drags on economic growth for several years, even after we’ve begun to raise the funds rate.  If so, satisfactory progress toward our objectives will probably require us to be more patient in removing accommodation than the historical record from previous recoveries would suggest.  I, therefore, think that guidance in this regard along the lines the Chairman gave in his September press conference and along the lines of B(6) is helpful. Equally important, in my view, is the conditionality that’s clearly expressed in the draft statement language.  If, for once, we’re pleasantly surprised and the economy improves more rapidly than we anticipate, the premise of the statement no longer applies.  Even if some of these clarifications of the reaction function would be valuable, there’s a question as to how they would best be conveyed.  Having them be part of the FOMC statement has the advantage of carrying the imprimatur of the Committee, but I also recognize that the statement can carry only so much water. I agree with the motivation for the inflation floor language.  We would be less likely, all else equal, to raise the funds rate after the unemployment rate threshold has been crossed, if inflation is running well below our 2 percent objective.  What gives me pause about thesuggested language is that it is missing an “all else equal” qualifier.  The inflation floor language that is contemplated is unconditional.  This would, in my view, carry a risk of committing us to a course we might come to regret.  Moreover, I’m not so clear on the benefits.  I think we can quite plausibly assert that if there’s slack in the economy and inflation is weak, removing accommodation would be counter to accomplishing our objectives.  But I wholeheartedly agree with the view that we must be every bit as vigilant in defending our inflation objective from below as above. The targeted market interventions discussed in the staff memo might send a powerful signal of our commitment to accommodation and to our forward guidance.  But they are also associated with some risks and complications that were well described in the staff memo.  I think we should leave such interventions on the table as options to be considered in the future, likely in extraordinary circumstances. Concerning simple rules for the pace of our asset purchases, I think this is an idea that has its heart in the right place.  It would be helpful to be able to communicate a simple rule that reduces purchases smoothly to zero as the labor market improves but, as the staff memo highlights, it is difficult to specify a rule that is simple and yet still reliably promotes our objectives across a broad range of plausible scenarios.  I favor using simple rules as guideposts, however, in our internal discussions, and I am also open to exploring whether there are rules that strike a better point on the tradeoff between use of communication and reliability in achieving our economic objectives. Finally, on MBS and Treasuries, on balance, I think it’s best to keep things simple and reduce them in tandem.

Passage number 163.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think it’s really beneficial to have so much discussion of what our communications strategy is.  I noticed yesterday and today that in your second point you mentioned the labor market outlook, and essentially didn’t reference a pickup in GDP growth.  Is that deliberate.  Are we sort of walking back from a pickup in growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply asking a question for clarification about the omission of GDP growth in the discussion.


Passage number 164.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The way I think about what was intended by that and what I think is sufficient for our purposes is—remember that our original thing is of course outlook for labor market—what GDP growth does is it provides the reason for thinking that labor market improvement will continue.  The way I have phrased it is not that we’re looking for increased GDP growth per se, but we’re looking for sufficient growth to support continuing gains in the labor market.  So it’s sort of tautological, and it’s not an additional criterion.  It’s just saying that the economy has to be strong enough.  We have seen improvement, but because we’re looking at the outlook for labor market, we also have to have some confidence that the economy is strong enough to support ongoing gains, and that’s all.  It doesn’t mean that GDP growth has to go to 3 percent.  In particular, in the scenario that you talked about with low productivity gains, 2 percent growth might be quite adequate to continue progress and would meet our criterion, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their perspective on what is sufficient for the purpose of labor market improvement and clarifying that GDP growth does not need to reach a specific percentage.


Passage number 165.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Well, there have been times in the past year when what came across to the public and what was reported was that a pickup in growth was sort of an additional criterion.  So I think we should be dissuading people from interpreting that as a broad concern that we’re looking for a big pickup in the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is expressing his belief that the messaging regarding a pickup in growth should be clarified to avoid misinterpretation.


Passage number 166.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’re looking for growth sufficient to ensure additional gains, ongoing gains in the labor market.  In other words, it wouldn’t be enough to say we’ve achieved a lot so far, but suddenly growth has gone off the cliff and there’s no prospect of further gains.  That wouldn’t really be an improvement in the outlook for the labor market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement emphasizes the need for continuous growth in order to ensure ongoing gains in the labor market.


Passage number 167.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, but then the labor market wouldn’t be gaining.  Is there a timing thing here.  Are you thinking of GDP as sort of a leading indicator of the labor market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and asking a question to better understand the timing and relationship between GDP and the labor market.


Passage number 168.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This goes back to discussions we’ve had.  What does it mean to say that we’re interested in the outlook for the labor market.  Clearly, as we’ve said on numerous occasions, if you’re looking at the outlook for the labor market, you really do have to look at the broad economic outlook because it’s overall economic conditions that will determine whether or not the labor market will continue to improve.  But it is the labor market and, of course, I didn’t say inflation going back to 2 percent—that’s implicit.  But it is the labor market that I think we ought to focus on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the importance of looking at the broader economic outlook when considering the outlook for the labor market. The statement about focusing on the labor market is not presented as conflicting with any other viewpoint.


Passage number 169.
 MR. LACKER.  All right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging and agreeing with the previous statement.


Passage number 170.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Anybody else.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Anybody else" suggests a request for other opinions or input, while "President Fisher" is simply stating a name or title.


Passage number 171.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, yesterday you gave some interesting data in terms of differentiating the growth of the GDP, excluding government and including government.  Could you just repeat those numbers.  Because the following statement dealt with the number of jobs lost in G; I think it was 600,000.  I am trying to recall what you said because I think that was part of the answer to Jeff‘s question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a request for clarification and recollection of previously mentioned information.


Passage number 172.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, what I said was, in the recovery so far, measuring from the trough quarter—I’m sure somebody will check my arithmetic here—the growth rate of real GDP has averaged about 2.2 percent, which seems about right, while the growth rate of real GDP less government spending has been more than 3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information and statistics without expressing any disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 173.
   MR. FISHER.  State and local plus federal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions different levels of government.


Passage number 174.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Less all government C&I.  So just private C plus I, no G.  On the other hand, this is just the spending part, and it doesn’t take into account whatever drag is coming from tax and transfer policy.  So it’s just the G part.  Then the other observation is if we just look at nonfarm payrolls since the trough of overall employment, there’s been a decline of600,000 government jobs even as private employment has risen by quite a few million.  At the same point in the 2001 recovery, there had been a gain of 400,000.  So compared with the previous recession, it was about a net difference of about 1 million at this stage of the recovery, which is obviously a pretty significant effect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presenting information and observations without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 175.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage provided. The speaker is expressing gratitude, indicating a positive sentiment.


Passage number 176.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation:

The statement "President Kocherlakota" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the role or title of an individual. Without further information or context, it is not possible to determine any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 177.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There are a lot of great ideas that we heard in the past few hours.  One in particular that I’d like to associate myself with is the Vice Chairman’s idea of thinking about ways to improve the SEP as a communication vehicle.  In particular, I think it would be useful to offer—at least in conjunction with, as a supplement to our current SEP—some notion of our forecast under a common policy assumption of some kind.  I think that would be valuable communication for the public to hear.  As I’ve indicated in the past, I have often struggled to talk to the public about the thought experiment where I’m in charge of monetary policy.  They don’t find that a useful thought experiment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is expressing agreement with the Vice Chairman's idea and suggesting a further addition to the communication strategy.


Passage number 178.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A counterfactual.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage only presents a counterfactual scenario by referring to President Evans without any further information or context. There is no contention or disagreement evident in this particular statement.


Passage number 179.
 MR. EVANS.  Well, on this point, I just want to remind us all that we did go down that road with a consensus forecast experiment, and a number of participants looking very technically at how you generate a forecast indicated that they would have trouble putting down a forecast that was an equilibrium—sustainable and whatnot.  So I certainly share the goal of what President Kocherlakota is advocating and would hope that we could get there, but it will be a challenge.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Evans reaffirms the goal mentioned by President Kocherlakota and acknowledges that it will be a challenge to achieve it.


Passage number 180.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, you can’t just announce a path.  In theory, you’d have to announce some kind of reaction function.  Anything else.  Why don’t we take 20 minutes for coffee and then we’ll do the monetary policy go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement and a suggestion.


Passage number 181.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don’t we reconvene.  Our last item is current monetary policy, and let me ask Bill English please introduce it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement indicated in this passage. The speaker is simply informing the group that it is time to resume the discussion and asks a specific member to introduce the next topic.


Passage number 182.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Bill.  Are there any questions for Bill.  [No response.]  Seeing none, let’s begin our go-round with President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. It is clear that there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The lack of response and the prompt to move on to President Williams indicate a smooth and agreeable flow in the conversation.

Explanation: The abbreviation "MR" does not provide any context or information to determine if there is any contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 184.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B but with two small modifications.  I recommend that we delete the first and the last sentences of the statement.  I’ll start with the first sentence.  This sentence puts too much emphasis on the role of the government shutdown, both in terms of the economic outlook and our own decisionmaking.  As I discussed yesterday, we are not missing key data, nor is economic performance during the intermeeting period particularly hard to assess.  Elsewhere the statement already mentions twice that fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, and that is enough.  Indeed, as a factor affecting our outlook, the temporary shutdown is minor compared with the ongoing fiscal austerity.  More importantly, highlighting the shutdown in the lead sentence of the statement may give the false impression that monetary policy is paralyzed in the face of short-term fiscal brinkmanship.  And it’s important to remember this fiscal brinkmanship is not likely to go away anytime soon.  I think this is not a message the Committee should be sending. Turning to the final sentence in paragraph 6, I think it, too, should be removed.  Although the Tealbook provides some brief discussion of the effects of headwinds, the Committee needs more-detailed quantitative analysis and discussion about the size, the scope, and source of such headwinds in 2016, before introducing them in the statement.  Now, as the Chairman said yesterday, there is analysis around this using the staff forecast, but I think that we should both discuss this further and see alternative models and analysis around that.  In any macro model it ispossible to decompose the various factors affecting the equilibrium real interest rate, or the headwinds, if you will, and such an analysis would be especially useful I think in thinking about the role of headwinds in 2016.  And, given the importance of our communications, it is essential that clear and well-grounded analysis underlies our statements. More broadly, I am concerned that this sentence attempts to impart to the public greater agreement on this issue than exists or is in fact necessary.  After all, we may agree on an action, even if we don’t reach a consensus about why we should take that action.  Most of us expect the funds rate to lift off only gradually, but still we may disagree about the reasons for that gradual liftoff.  It could be headwinds, it could be part of a lower for longer strategy, or because we think a high-pressure economy will draw people back into the labor force and combat hysteresis, or a combination of all three of these.  We don’t have to agree on a rationale to find common ground on the policy path.  So that brings me to a principle I stated yesterday about the danger of extending our forward guidance beyond the point where there is a strong and clear consensus on the Committee.  Putting headwinds in the statement today provides the Committee’s endorsement of a particular view on the evolution of the economy three or four years out.  Given the inherent uncertainty about the distant future, I doubt such a consensus exists and I think it would be unwise to suggest it does.  Moreover, because market expectations are now broadly aligned with the views expressed in the SEP, it’s not clear that we need to fix expectations about the path of the funds rate in 2016 and beyond. Of course, one problem I pointed to yesterday and last month is that we are approaching our 6½ percent unemployment threshold.  We need to convey what will drive our policy decisions once we reach that threshold, and I would add the post-threshold language from paragraph 5, alternative A, that begins, “Once the unemployment rate reaches 6½ percent.”  Iwould not include the inflation floor language at this time.  Bolstering our forward guidance this way might also help with another problem we discussed yesterday and this morning, and that is that market participants seem to have trouble distinguishing actions regarding asset purchases from our intentions regarding future short rates.  Signaling that the Committee is not in fact itching to raise the funds rate target could help market participants make this distinction.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Williams, is expressing their support for alternative B and providing specific suggestions for modifications to the statement. They offer their opinions and provide reasoning for why they believe certain sentences should be deleted or modified. However, there is no indication of any disagreement or conflict with others in the passage.


Passage number 185.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage consists of a simple statement expressing gratitude towards President Kocherlakota. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 186.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I think about our policy decisions, I always turn back to our strategic plan, the longer-term goals and strategies statement that we issued in January 2012 and reaffirmed in January 2013.  I use that as my lodestar, so to speak, in thinking about our decisions.  And as I think about that, I see that the medium-term outlook for prices and employment—really, a five-year outlook for prices—remains weak relative to our longer-run goals.  So I am trying to think about what would be a policy choice that would foster a more rapid recovery toward those dual mandate objectives, and I find alternative A attractive along those lines. In terms of the specifics of alternative A, I sense the consensus for the broad set of indicators approach as opposed to actually the more quantitative approach of lowering the unemployment rate threshold.  I think that both have value, and President Williams is right to caution us about trying to structure forward guidance for which there isn’t strong Committee support.  But that said, I think a lot of the value of our forward guidance in terms of the unemployment rate threshold has come because it has been quantitative.  We have the ability to go out and check whether or not it is working.  We can assess, and I think market participants can assess, exactly what that means.  So I personally would favor a more quantitative approach.As I have indicated in the past, at the risk of adding a little more complexity to the statement, what we could do is add a separate paragraph about what is going to happen between 6½ and 6 or 6½ and 5½.  That paragraph could have a different inflation protection in it.  It could be a lower one, 2¼ as opposed to 2½.  We could consider the idea of a financial stability knockout.  I’m not advocating that by any means, but that’s something else you could add to that new paragraph.  So this would make it clear that what we are doing is offering clarity about what is going to happen when the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent.  But with that said, the broad set of indicators language is a positive move forward.  I don’t think it’s as positive as trying to be more quantitative, as we have done in the past. I thought President Williams summarized some of the problems with the last sentence of alternative A and the first sentence of alternative A, and I will associate myself with his remarks on that dimension.  So I would drop those sentences at this time in alternative A. Having said I support alternative A at this time, let me talk a little bit about alternative C.  Despite the weak macroeconomic outlook in Tealbook, Book A, and I don’t think there’s any prospect of that changing in the next six months materially, I do think that there will remain a need to talk about and think about the issue of reducing the flow of asset purchases in the next six months or so.  I think the key problem or challenge for us—and I talked about this in the past two go-rounds—is what we think about success for the asset purchase program.  How we thought about it going in, in September 2012, is different from what we think about as success for the fed funds rate program.  And I think we have to be clear about why we think those definitions of success as being different.  I think, Mr. Chairman, your idea of having a survey to gather the reasons among the Committee about why we think about success as being different in terms of the one tool having cost and efficacy considerations that the other tool does not, is goingto be very helpful in sharpening our communication about why we are contemplating reducing the flow of purchases, the use of a form of greater stimulus, when our anticipated rate of progress toward our goals remains so slow. With that said, I would be willing to contemplate the steps described in alternative C, not at this meeting but at some future date, if they took place after those in A, or simultaneously with those in A, and if they were justified, at least in part, in terms of the cost and efficacy considerations that we are going to be discussing further.  And I think we should be explaining clearly in the FOMC statement and other public communications that cost and efficacy considerations are important drivers behind a near-term decision to reduce purchases.  That is, I think, the only way to drive home that we remain fully committed to rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives.  I think the survey tool should help us have a much clearer understanding among ourselves of what we mean when we talk about those costs. To summarize, Mr. Chairman, at this meeting I favor alternative A.  I personally would simply lower the unemployment rate threshold to 6 percent or even lower, but I would be willing to support alternative A at this meeting with the broader set of indicators language instead.  I would drop the last and first sentence.  I could see supporting a version of alternative C in the next few months, but that version of alternative C would have to include clearer language that underscores the role of efficacy and costs as key elements, in the Committee’s thinking.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is sharing their thoughts and preferences on different policy alternatives, but they do not express any disagreement with the ideas presented.


Passage number 187.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of two separate statements: "Thank you" and "President Rosengren." There is no contention or disagreement expressed in these statements.


Passage number 188.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B as written.  Last June I was expecting that by now real GDP growth would be picking up, that payroll employment growth would be rising, and that we would have avoided disruptive fiscal policythis fall.  Had that played out as expected, I would have supported a reduction in purchases at the September meeting.  However, that is not the set of facts that we faced at the September meeting, nor is it the set of facts facing us today.  Moreover, for the second half of the year, private forecasters, the Tealbook, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston forecast all envision GDP growth not much different than the 2.2 percent average growth over the past four years of this very slow recovery, along with continued sluggish expansion in payroll employment.  And this outcome is achieved only under the rather optimistic assumption that fiscal policy decisionmaking will not suffer from another self-inflicted wound. Since the start of this recovery, we have been assuming that monetary policy was sufficiently accommodative to return to full employment and 2 percent inflation within approximately a four-year timeframe.  We have now had five years of a very sluggish recovery, and we are still assuming that we are just four years away from reaching full employment and 2 percent inflation.  Given the consistent pattern of over-forecasting, we should probably be placing more weight on realized data than on our forecasts.  In terms of policy, that means no change in monetary policy until we see economic data consistent with achieving full employment and 2 percent inflation within four years.  Actually, my preference would be to do whatever we can to achieve both those goals sooner than the four-year horizon in the Tealbook.  However, to have any chance of achieving our goals in four years, we need to see 3 percent real GDP growth in the data, we need to see payroll employment closer to the 200,000 jobs that are forecast next year in the data, and we need to see inflation numbers clearly trending toward 2 percent.  The Tealbook forecast expects us to see that in the first quarter.  If that forecast becomes a reality, then that is when we should consider reducing our purchases.  My expectation is that evaluation is likely to be difficult before March.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's position and expectations regarding monetary policy and economic data.

Passage number 190.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.  Oh, I’m sorry.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is thanking President Fisher and then apologizing for mistakenly addressing President Lockhart.


Passage number 191.
 MR. LOCKHART.  A question for President Bullard.  The ratio of central bank balance sheet to GDP is an interesting ratio, but I don’t intuitively get that mechanical connection.  If you take national debt to GDP, there’s sort of the notion of the economy that services the debt should have some relationship, but explain to me, if you would, the connection between central bank balance sheet and GDP.  How does that work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of a question for President Bullard, seeking an explanation of the connection between the central bank balance sheet and GDP.


Passage number 192.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, I don’t think we have good theories about it.  But what I would encourage is that if we just talk in terms of hundreds of billions of dollars being added to the balance sheet, that’s just a number.  I think we need to get more to the economics of where that limit is and why we think that limit is there.  And I’m giving a very simple argument, which is that other countries have far surpassed us already.  They don’t seem to have created a lot of financial instability or a lot of inflation, and so I just don’t think we have a case—not an empirical case right now—that there’s some kind of threshold at 25 percent of GDP or at28 percent of GDP or something like that.  We just don’t see that from the available empirical evidence and so, for now, I think it’s clear sailing.  I’m not saying you want to go on forever, but I think that scaling it is maybe a little bit better way to think about it.  Also, in U.S. history, the size of the balance sheet has been bigger than it is today, in the late 1930s, and so it’s not unprecedented historically either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and providing evidence to support it.


Passage number 193.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to answer the question without the passage provided. The term "President Fisher" does not provide enough context to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 194.
 MR. FISHER.  As I think I mentioned at the previous meeting, an efficient Committee starts like the Balkans and ends like Switzerland, which is not quite what I meant for that discussion.  [Laughter] I’m going to just be simple here.  I’m going to join the Western–Lutheran Coalition, meaning I agree fully with President Williams, President Kocherlakota, and President Bullard, in terms of getting rid of the first sentence and getting rid of the last sentence of alternative B, given that that seems to be where we’re going.  Based on the discussion we had, it doesn’t sound like we’re quite ready for A(5) or for C(4)′.  Everybody at this table knows that I don’t like the program that we’re currently undertaking, but I don’t have a vote in this meeting, and I would suggest that President Williams is actually quite wise in his recommendation.  In fact, I would remove all of paragraph 6.  I think the word “eventually” is just way too indefinite, too open-ended, and it might sort of look like we’re just not going to stop this program, but at a minimum, I would get rid of the first and last sentences.  He’s right.  Fiscal policy retrenchment is mentioned two other places in the statement, in the first paragraph and the third paragraph.  So I’m in accord with President Williams, President Kocherlakota, and President Bullard on that front.One small point, which I don’t expect you to change, but I just want to note—I mentioned it yesterday.  Talking about the housing sector, I think it’s incorrect to say that it “slowed somewhat in response to higher mortgage rates,” although the word “somewhat” may condition it.  Again, talking to the builders, talking to the housing companies, they will point out that is a partial reason and particularly an extreme movement of 100 basis points.  The Desk pointed out yesterday that we’ve actually had a settling down of mortgage rates.  The builders will tell you that they priced too aggressively in their eagerness to recoup the past few years.  They have a limited amount of property to work with.  Due to the labor and resource situation, it has taken them twice as long to build as they normally have in normal cycles.  And then, finally, they will mention that mortgage rates have risen, but it’s not the principal reason.  So I would simply recommend that we insert the word “partially” after “months,” “has slowed somewhat in recent months partially in response to higher mortgage rates.”  I don’t think the Committee will accept that, but it would be viewed as more realistic by the people that are in the industry if they were to read this statement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is expressing agreement with President Williams, President Kocherlakota, and President Bullard on certain points, and is also making a suggestion regarding the wording of the statement. However, there is no indication of disagreement or contention between him and the others mentioned.


Passage number 195.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t know why you’re so pessimistic, President Fisher.  I’m happy to put that on the table.

Passage number 196.
 MR. FISHER.  I would be delighted if you did, and I look forward to it being voted down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Fisher expresses his enthusiasm for the suggestion and looks forward to its outcome, without indicating any opposing or disagreeing views.


Passage number 197.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 203.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with a comment that Governor Yellen made during her earlier statement that we appear to be in a pretty good place today.  So I prefer no action, and I guess that’s alt-B. At our September meeting, we clearly indicated that we needed more and better confirmation that the SEP outlook was concrete and achievable.  Since then, the data flow was interrupted and the fiscal developments in Washington piled greater uncertainty onto our current setting.  I don’t know, maybe I’m in the minority on that one, according to some of the comments so far.  At the margin, the economic setting is most likely worse than we thought in September. Now, with regard to particular elements in the statement, I don’t agree with the suggestions about deleting the first sentence regarding the role of the government shutdown.  I think it’s a reality check and that most commentators would say that it’s more difficult to assess.  I probably didn’t hear all of the details of President Williams’s careful assessment of why thingsaren’t that much more difficult to assess.  I would guess that in Chicago we had computer programs that had missing values and, when we went to run them normally, they just blew up, and so we had to do something in order to correct them.  I think it’s objectively correct that it’s more difficult to assess, and that’s all it says, “somewhat more difficult to assess.”  However, then we say information received seems like things are actually pretty good.  I think that if you read the statement from the outset without that, it seems a bit too bright.  “Information received since the FOMC…”, I can imagine somebody—Jon Stewart—saying, “What information did they receive during that time period.”  Anyway, for me, it really adds more questions than answers.  Maybe there’s a rewording that can make this better, but that bothers me.  I think the higher mortgage rates also are a pretty good explanation for at least a partial reason why we’ve seen housing.  The other factors that President Fisher mentioned have been longer lasting, at least in my conversations with people in the housing industry.  Some of those effects have been around for a while.  It’s the increase in mortgage rates that’s been more timely and associated with that. Now, on the alt-A suggestion, I will admit a great deal of sympathy with the alt-A post-threshold guidance in paragraph 5, and President Williams rightly put emphasis on that yesterday.  I did not hear enough of a consensus for the 6 percent threshold change in forward guidance, certainly not today, maybe never, and I think that some additional post-threshold guidance helps.  I do think that the production function for making it do what we want it to do will involve an awful lot of additional commentary from the center of the Committee—namely, you, Mr. Chairman, or Madam Chair, depending on when we do it.  I think it’s going to require a couple, three-times-a-month type of commentary on that to drive it home because it’s qualitative, and I think people are going to start asking questions about what it really means.  The 6 percentmaybe could have been dealt with, pounded in, and then it would be there.  But I think that based on the kinds of questions that the rest of us field when we go out and speak and those the wire reporters ask us, they’re constantly asking for more information about that.  And I think it would be incumbent on us to make that effective, to do it more often; that’s a feature of that. Regarding the last paragraph’s forward guidance on the pace of increasing the funds rate, I do favor some type of guidance.  I’m probably a little more sympathetic toward it than the commentary so far, but my staff has more concerns about it than I do.  I’ll simply mention that when my expert staff is bringing up these same objections, it may be an indicator of how the public may struggle with that.  I definitely agree that headwinds present an enormous obstacle and are going to continue to be that way for a while, but, to some, it might sound too downbeat for too long regarding our assessment of future growth prospects.  So it may lead the public to believe we’re more negative about the future than I personally intend by that guidance.  Now, to address this, I think it could be helpful to add a bit more specificity if this approach is seriously considered at some point.  So I would favor adding something to qualify headwinds, like fiscal and household headwinds that have been restraining the economic recovery, and then the language there.  I think you made an excellent observation, Mr. Chairman, about the effect of the fiscal policy to date.  It has been really big, and it would justify that type of language.  And the household sector is going to continue to assess and work to right-size its debt obligations for a considerably period to come.  I expect a long adjustment period like the analysis that we heard yesterday, unless we see much stronger wage and income growth across all industrial and occupational levels.  I think that that could work, but I assume that it’s probably not live for today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with certain suggestions in the statement, such as deleting the first sentence regarding the role of the government shutdown. They also express sympathy with the alt-A post-threshold guidance but indicate that they did not hear enough consensus for the 6 percent threshold change in forward guidance. Additionally, they express disagreement with the lack of specificity in the guidance on the pace of increasing the funds rate and suggest adding more qualification to the language about headwinds.


Passage number 204.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is simply expressing gratitude and referring to someone as "President Lockhart."


Passage number 205.
MR. LOCKHART:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I actually think the first sentence is accurate and appropriate.  It addresses a question that is held in the minds of the public.  I don’t think it overreaches, and I think it sets up the tentativeness of the conclusions on the economy and the reasons that we’re staying the course at this meeting.  So I don’t have an objection to keeping it in.  I have some sympathy with President Fisher’s “partially.”  I actually had the same thought, chose not to bring it up, but I do agree that there are other factors at work, and it might be good to qualify that a little bit.  I think the bigger question, of course, is the forward guidance “in addition” language in paragraph 6.  As I said in an earlier round, I favor enhancing guidance with this measure of strength, if not more, but not at this meeting.  I think it’s wiser to minimize changes under the circumstances around this meeting.  If it were adopted in December as a practical matter, the Chairman would have the SEP in hand and would be able to use a press conference to guide interpretation of that.  So I prefer standing pat at this meeting with the September language for the most part, minimizing the changes, and waiting until December to at least consider strengthening rate guidance qualitatively and possibly even quantitatively.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and providing their thoughts and opinions on different aspects of the discussion.


Passage number 206.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 207.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before I comment on my preferred policy option, I wanted to provide some background on my thinking.  My estimate for the natural rate of unemployment is 6 percent, and I know that this is on the high end of the range of estimates in the SEP, but I take solace that I’m not the only person with this estimate.  So with my natural rate of unemployment at 6 percent, I believe that we are going to need to begin to raise the federal funds rate when unemployment is somewhere in the range of, say, 6¼ to 6½ percent.  That is less than 1 percentage point from where the unemployment rate stands today.Since the asset purchase program began last summer, the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly 1 percentage point, and we have had solid, if not spectacular, growth in payrolls.  So if we wait much longer to adjust the pace of asset purchases, we run the risk of making it even more difficult to separate our asset purchase program from our fed funds rate guidance, because when it comes to our hopes for the unemployment rate, their boundaries start to blur together.  And separating these tools seemed like it was a key theme from our policy planning discussion go-round.  Suppose the unemployment rate continues to decline at its recent pace and the first reduction in the asset purchase program is put off until next March at the earliest, which seems to be what markets are thinking.  In that scenario I think separation of the two programs is going to become even more difficult.  I favored slowing the pace of asset purchases at our last meeting, and I realize that slowing purchases at this meeting is essentially impossible because it would generate a second surprise in as many meetings. In light of the current market expectations, I would suggest that the Committee’s statement in the form of alternative A is going to be read as indicating that asset purchases are unlikely to slow until some time in 2014.  So I would like to see some language inserted into alternative B that would give the Committee greater flexibility to slow asset purchases in December or in January if the incoming data support such an action.  And I think this could easily be done by inserting the following sentence after the first sentence of paragraph 3 in alt-B.  I would suggest inserting, “In the coming months, if the Committee continues to see further progress toward its objectives for the labor market and inflation, the Committee will likely begin to gradually reduce the pace of asset purchases.”  Then the paragraph would just continue with, “However, at this meeting the Committee decided to wait for more evidence,” et cetera.  I think giving us a little more flexibility to move in December and January would be important.In addition, like many others have already suggested, I would not add the last sentence in alternative B.  In my mind, the effectiveness of our communications would be best served by only making further alterations to the forward funds rate guidance when we actually adjust the rate of asset purchases.  I think making these changes together would help to decouple our asset purchase program from our fed funds rate guidance.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Ms. Pianalto is expressing her disagreement with the current policy of continuing the asset purchase program without slowing down the pace of purchases. She argues that waiting too long to adjust the pace of asset purchases could make it more difficult to separate the asset purchase program from the fed funds rate guidance. She suggests inserting language in alternative B that would give the Committee greater flexibility to slow asset purchases in December or January if the incoming data support such an action. She also disagrees with adding the last sentence in alternative B, as she believes it would be more effective to only make further alterations to the forward funds rate guidance when they actually adjust the rate of asset purchases.


Passage number 208.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply expresses gratitude to President George.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 209.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Alternative B is certainly consistent with the decision in September to await more evidence that progress will be sustained, and in a world of noisy data and government shutdowns, awaiting more evidence of progress increasingly seems to be a very high bar.  That said, I do not support alternative B for several reasons.  As I have noted before, it continues aggressive easing despite actual and forecasted improvement in the economy.  There has been cumulative and sustained improvement despite fiscal headwinds and slow healing in labor markets.  And despite the critique that forecasts have been too optimistic, they have accurately projected forward momentum.  The Tealbook, the SEP, as well as private forecasters continue to do so. I do worry about the cost of this level of accommodation, perhaps because the costs among this Committee have remained ill-defined.  Our policy planning go-round highlights the challenges we face in several dimensions, such as how to communicate our goals, how to understand the effects of our tools, and explaining how they will be retired.  We should continue to focus on these issues not only for consistent messaging, but, importantly, to affirm our understanding of the efficacy of these tools relative to our goals and the realities of the economy. The emphasis on data dependence is important, but I’ve been more focused on cumulative progress rather than the most recent data point.  Considering our progress just sinceJune, the unemployment rate has fallen; employment has increased by 600,000; and the September ISM manufacturing survey had the highest reading in over two years, driven in part by a rise in employment component.  The August ISM non-manufacturing index had its highest reading in eight years.  With this backdrop, I continue to view taking steps toward slowing the pace of asset purchases as appropriate and reasonable.  It is difficult for me to see that adding accommodation at some reduced pace represents any meaningful tightening. I also am concerned that market expectations of the cumulative size of LSAPs could continue to move higher despite continued job gains and declines in the unemployment rate.  Recall that primary dealers expected the unemployment rate at the end of asset purchases to be 7 percent according to the dealer survey prior to the June meeting.  This estimate was unchanged in the flash survey after the June press conference.  Given the latest survey that now shows expectations for tapering in March, the continued job growth and decline in the unemployment rate make it likely that we will not even start tapering before the unemployment rate reaches 7 percent.  Adjustments in these expectations regarding LSAPs might be appropriate if less progress had been made than previously anticipated or the medium-term outlook substantially deteriorated.  However, the unemployment rate has fallen more than expected and private-sector expectations for job growth are likely to exceed what had been forecast in September of 2012.  That said, it seems increasingly problematic to reinforce a direct connection between LSAPs and labor markets as we have discussed.  Moreover, postponing the start of LSAP reductions reinforces a message in my view that we think the outlook is weak when, in fact, the growth trajectory we continue to project shows acceleration. Finally, I would prefer to omit the proposed new language in paragraph 1 related to the government shutdown for reasons others have raised, as well as in paragraph 6, which I thinkdoes little to clarify our expected policy path and might introduce yet another unobserved variable into the policy-setting landscape.  And I would also be supportive of looking at some modification to the mortgage rate increase as the sole reason for the housing slowing.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. George states that she does not support alternative B for several reasons. She highlights the improvement in the economy and argues that adding more accommodation at a reduced pace does not represent meaningful tightening. She also expresses concern about market expectations and the connection between LSAPs and labor markets. Additionally, she disagrees with the proposed new language related to the government shutdown and the mortgage rate increase as the sole reason for the housing slowing.


Passage number 210.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude from someone named President Lacker.


Passage number 211.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was in favor of tapering at our last meeting, and I still believe economic conditions warrant reducing the pace of our asset purchases, given the improvements we have seen in the labor markets and the likelihood that continued economic growth—even at 2 percent—will generate continued labor market improvements.  So I find myself in alignment with President George. But under the assumption we do not begin tapering today, I don’t think we should be adding any new elements to our forward guidance at this time.  One reason is that the statement is pretty long as it is.  And I’ll admit I don’t have a theory of the optimal statement length, but it has been getting longer over time.  And while pondering the growing length of our statements, my research director quipped that he half-expected to open the Tealbook one day soon and see alternative B begin with the words, “Call me Ishmael.”  [Laughter]  Specifically, I find myself in agreement with President Williams about the last sentence in alternative B and that we ought to revert to 5.  This constitutes new forward guidance, and it adds a pessimistic characterization of the outlook.  I agree with President Bullard that it is likely to be taken as a shift in the Committee’s outlook.  And for the reasons that Professor Woodford has made really clear, could have a dampening effect on current economic growth by making people feel as if we are more discouraged about future growth.I also agree with President Williams about dropping the first sentence.  It is not that much more difficult to assess economic conditions.  Sure, things are murky now, but I don’t remember them being a lot less murky than they are right now.  The other thing about this is that it places a lot of importance on one month’s data, and it is the kind of thing we try and avoid doing.  It implies that we do place more attention to one month’s data than I think we really do or did today or yesterday.  In addition, it implies a connection to fiscal policy as well.  The murkiness has to do with the potential economic effects of the shutdown, not just the effects on data collection.  And there, I think, we have gotten tripped up in the past by tying monetary policy to fiscal policy, and then having control sort of pass out of our hands and feeling hung up for a period. I agree with the point President Plosser and President Fisher made about housing.  And I liked President Pianalto’s suggestion about language, so I pretty much agree with all of the suggestions for changing the statement that were made so far.  Thank you very much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their agreement and alignment with the views of other individuals.


Passage number 212.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, President Lacker.  Governor Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you, President Lacker. Governor Yellen" is simply expressing gratitude towards two individuals.


Passage number 213.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I personally considered our September decision a close call, but, in my view, developments have vindicated the wisdom of our choice.  We didn’t yet have sufficient confirmation that the improvements we had seen in the labor market would be sustained, and our decision was consistent with the basic framework that was laid out in June and got across to markets that our policy is truly data-dependent and we aren’t just racing to the exits.  Given that incoming data on spending and the labor market have been weak, and what I at least see as the confusing, but hopefully transitory, effects of the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate, it remains hard to assess theunderlying state of the recovery.  So I think it is right to wait until December to gain better visibility on the outlook. As I mentioned yesterday, I think our September communications moved us into a better place, and we certainly haven’t foreclosed the option of taking the first step to reduce the pace of purchases in December if the data by that time confirm our expectation of ongoing improvement in the labor market conditions.  Whether the first taper comes in December or sometime early next year, I think we stand the best chance of avoiding significant upheaval if we stay the course and continue within the framework we laid out in June.  Given that our policy decisions are data-dependent, we should decide when first to taper based on the data regardless of whether markets perfectly anticipate our decision at that time. I think we are in a decent place with respect to our asset purchase program and our forward guidance if progress toward our goals continues at the pace I view as most likely, or, as I noted in my economic remarks, under several other plausible scenarios.  Even though I would prefer to see more rapid improvement in the labor market, it may be prudent under the modal outlook to complete purchases sometime around the middle of next year.  We have discussed the uncertain costs and risks associated with a very large balance sheet and stopping around that time may arguably preserve more capacity for us to respond to some future large, negative shock.  But the outlook is uncertain, and we need to be mindful that a scenario could unfold along the lines I discussed yesterday:  a scenario where economic growth does not pick up, progress in the labor market stalls, and the economy is stuck in the mud.  In such a scenario, disinflationary pressures could also mount. I agree with others who have said we need to have a plan for a case where we eventually wind down our asset purchase program without a declaration of victory.  And I think the surveythat you proposed, Mr. Chairman, will be extremely useful in developing that plan.  I think we have all indicated discomfort with QE-infinity.  It’s not that there is some clear absolute limit to the size of our balance sheet, but, rather, that the type of cost-benefit analysis you laid out at our December meeting applies.  In particular, we need to ask ourselves how far it would be prudent to go with asset purchases, given our assessment of how pressing the need is for action, how much the purchases are likely to help, the highly uncertain but presumably growing costs and risks, as well as the availability of other tools. Your framework provides a way to think about some subtle but important issues.  For example, do we believe that LSAPs have a larger marginal benefit in a period of real market distress or serious deflationary forces than in the stuck-in-the-mud scenario.  If so, might there be an argument for reducing the pace of purchases in the stuck-in-the-mud economy so as to keep some capacity in reserve.  And if we were to reduce the pace of asset purchases at a time when the outlook for employment and inflation were unsatisfactory, what other actions could we take to support a stronger recovery and to defend our inflation target. In summary, at this point, our current framework has provided guidance for what I consider to be my baseline scenario, and I remain hopeful that things will play out in line with the program we have outlined.  I do, however, think it would be prudent for us to spend more time developing a plan B for how our asset purchases might evolve under more pessimistic scenarios and to shape our communications in a way that would smooth the transition to such an unhappy state.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Yellen, is expressing her support for alternative B and discussing her views on the current state of the recovery and the potential future actions of the Federal Reserve. She also mentions the need for a plan B for asset purchases under more pessimistic scenarios.


Passage number 214.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude towards Governor Tarullo.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 215.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just in terms of our medium-term planning, continuing the discussion from the earlier go-round, I will now say somewhat moreaffirmatively that I think it would be worth our individually and collectively thinking more about the alternative approach that Charlie Plosser suggested, which is to say instead of a tapering when we are ready to make a change in the LSAP policy, we instead think about announcing a total amount of the LSAP purchase and then just continue however many months it would take to get us to that point. Turning to today’s action, I, like most others, support alternative B.  I have more to say about the language than I normally do, but that is prompted in part by the comments that others have made.  I am in favor not only of retaining the first sentence of paragraph 1 but of actually strengthening, or at least expanding, it.  I mean, it is a positive and not a normative statement.  It is supposed to be, as Charlie Plosser did say, describing a situation as opposed to suggesting a particular policy action.  First, it doesn’t actually suggest that there has been significant fiscal contraction, other than that which is already ongoing.  It simply says it has made it harder to assess economic conditions during the intermeeting period, which I find actually quite true.  Something that is omitted from that statement, though, is actually the principal reason why I find the conclusion true, and that is the uncertainty around the lifting of the federal debt ceiling.  I think the effect of the shutdown itself was probably concentrated in Washington and a few other areas where there were delays in contractor payments being made, and the like, and I think the staff expects that most of that effect will be reversed in the coming weeks and months.  But in talking to market actors generally, what I found was that the run-up to the uncertainty and the residue of questions around the federal debt ceiling had more people hitting the pause button on things that they were thinking about doing.  And it is that which, I think, makes things a little bit more difficult to assess.  Will the pre-talk about shutdown and fiscal cliff trend continue through and be visible by December, or will the effects of the shutdown and the fiscal cliff debate lingerand be another blow to the general certainty about where the economy is headed.  So I would actually expand the statement to say that “the effects of recent fiscal developments, including the temporary shutdown of the federal government, uncertainty around the lifting of the federal debt ceiling, and delays in releases of some key data, have made the evolution of economic conditions during the intermeeting period somewhat more difficult to assess.” On the question of the higher mortgage rates, I was under the impression—but this may be wrong—that existing home sales are more sensitive to mortgage rate changes than new construction, for some of the reasons I think Richard explained.  The only thing I’d say, though, is if people don’t want to leave the sentence as it is, I guess I would prefer to just delete the last phrase “in response to higher mortgage rates” rather than to insert “partially.” I am just going to note in passing, but not suggest a language change, that I am not sure that I, at this point, fully subscribe to the first sentence of paragraph 3, which I see is now “consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.”  I think that’s actually an open question at this point, which kind of gets back to the points I was making about paragraph 1.  But I definitely do not suggest a change in the language, certainly not at this time. And, finally, on paragraph 6, I join with many others in thinking that at least at this time it’s probably better not to include it.  Hearing some of you, it sounds as though many of you would like to maybe see some massaging of the language itself.  But in terms of timing, I agree with what I think Jay said yesterday, and others have echoed, which is that if we are going to do something like this it is probably better to do it at a time when we have a new SEP, which confirms the expectation that is in there, and gives the Chairman an opportunity to explain it.  On the downbeat point, I get what people are saying.  But if the SEP is downbeat, then it is a little odd to be too worried about being downbeat in the statement.  Maybe there is a reason for that,but, as I understand it, the motivation for this language is the SEP.  And we have stated our collective expectations in the SEP, and they are not overly optimistic.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the language in paragraph 1 and suggests expanding it to include the uncertainty around the lifting of the federal debt ceiling. They also express uncertainty about the statement in paragraph 3 and suggest not including paragraph 6 at this time.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or arguments that can be disagreed upon or disputed. It simply mentions laughter and the title "Governor Stein."


Passage number 221.
   MR. STEIN.  I support alternative B.  I don’t mind the first sentence in paragraph 1.  I will also join the growing chorus that wants to kill paragraph 6 of alternative B.  I think timing is part of the argument.  If we’re going to do it, we want to do it at a time when we’re tapering.  Massaging the language is also an issue.  But I wanted to underscore some of the points that President Williams made.  I think there are some really kind of deeper issues here.  One is, if we go in this direction, it is pretty important to be true to the idea that this is not about making another commitment, but it is about explaining what the right time-consistent path is likely be.  It’s a delicate thing to do because in our communication, of necessity in recent times, we have, in some sense, really blurred together the concepts of commitment and communication.  We say things like we are using communication to lower the long-term rate.  I mean, communication, on average, should be kind of like a coin toss, right.  These concepts have gotten pretty blurred together, and it will take some care to unblur them.  Otherwise, I think it would be quite easy, if we are not careful, for the market to basically hear a statement like this as we are promising the funds rate is going to be 2 percent in 2016, which I think we probably don’t want to do, or I’ll say I’m not sure I would want to do.And, again, this is something that John mentioned.  r* is a nice and very, very helpful theoretical construct, not easily or simply measured.  If we sat down and had a staff seminar on this, I think we would probably be a little hard-pressed to agree on what r* is today.  There is this sort of very model-heavy thing, and there are a lot of measurement issues—the equity premium, all that kind of stuff, which is not easy to measure.  To do this guidance, we are sort of talking about what we think r* will be in 2016, and whatever your standard errors are around its value today, they are going to be bigger for future values.  Again, that’s not a reason not to do this.  I think it’s perfectly sensible.  At some level you have to have a point estimate, and I think it’s perfectly reasonable to explain and defend the point estimate, but it needs to be done in the context of understanding.  Again, I think we are going to have to move to a regime ultimately where we are not telling people the funds rate two or three years in advance, and we have to make sure to communicate that carefully.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for "alternative B" and discussing various aspects of the issue at hand.

Passage number 223.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The only information provided is the title "Governor Powell," which does not indicate any conflict or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 224.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I see the Committee as still operating under the broad framework for reducing asset purchases that the Chairman articulated after the June and September meetings.  And going forward I see two broad cases.  In the first case, the data are strong enough to credibly warrant tapering and the fiscal negotiations conclude for now without disruptive consequences.  In that case the market will expect taper and the Committee should taper in keeping with existing guidance.  But what to do if the economy continues on more or less its current path of 2 percent growth, payroll gains that oscillate between decent and meager, and declining unemployment helped along partly by unwanted declines in the labor forceparticipation rate, or, alternatively, perhaps the declines in unemployment will slow or stop as labor force participation stabilizes.  I think, in that broad case, there is a choice to be made.  The Committee can just keep buying $85 billion of securities a month through 2014 and 2015, indefinitely, what President Lacker referred to as the “hamster wheel scenario.”  If we pass the March meeting with no hint of another potential approach, then I think that is kind of the track that we’re on.  The alternative is to adopt a shift in the mix of tool strategy:  gradually bring asset purchases to a halt by the end of next year, and strengthen forward guidance only if necessary.  And I think the time may be coming to make that change.  I hope not.  And I’m inclined to favor this strategy. In terms of the timing, I think it’s important to look at the calendar, as President Pianalto was suggesting.  We’re about two years away from, in the base case, hitting the natural rate.  The range of natural rate from 6 to, say, low 5s would be hit sometime in 2016—about two years out.  If you think about the red zone of tapering as being March and June, as I think of it now today—I would like to be wrong, I would like it to be earlier, but probably March or June are the red zone—we effectively have almost a year of runway for the actual taper, call it nine months.  At about that time, at the end of 2014, you are hitting the unemployment threshold.  Then, you have promised to wait for a considerable period, so you have used up most of 2015 waiting to think about actually raising rates.  At the end of 2015, you are right at the beginning of the zone of the natural rate, and now you haven’t raised rates at all, so you’ve got to get up to at least 2 percent, even in our headwinds scenario.  I guess I lay all of that out just to say that I don’t see it as in any way premature to be having this conversation.  There has been a tremendous amount of progress made, and I think it is time to go ahead.  And I think doing this in March or June of next year would in no sense be premature in the base case.I think there will be major communications challenges in either of these two cases, but in the latter case where we are tapering and it’s not a great outcome, I would still emphasize the extent of progress.  I would emphasize that the program has broadly achieved the goal that the Committee set forward of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and I would use the Chairman’s three talking points of data-dependence, stock of progress, and independence of tools as well. It seems to me that it will still never be a great idea to talk about the inefficacy of asset purchases, and I’m with President Bullard on this.  I would just point out that, in my opinion, there have been several occasions on which it would have been appropriate to taper, ignoring, for the moment, the question of the market’s preparation.  For example, June was a time of significant optimism about the economy, with big payroll numbers.  Of course, the market was not ready for it.  My point is that the Committee doesn’t have to choose a time that minimizes its credibility.  If it comes to this, it is appropriate to wait and taper at a time when credibility is higher in terms of payroll numbers and the other tests we have laid out for ourselves. In terms of the statement, I have heard all of the arguments.  I guess I would come down: take the first sentence out, take the last sentence out, take out “in response to higher mortgage rates,” take it all out.  [Laughter]  Leave it blank.  And I do kind of think we are all over fiscal policy here.  We’ve got two other mentions of it.  It starts to sound like a little too much.  It is nice to mention fiscal policy, but we are doing it twice already.  Those are the things I would do.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the following passage. 


Passage number 225.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 226.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I favor alt-B.  In general I think we’ve managed to get financial conditions back to a good place in which we can expect them to be supportive of theeconomy, and if this is sustained that should help generate the pickup in the overall growth rate that we’re seeking so that we can actually be confident of seeing substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  I think we don’t want to disturb that situation at this meeting.  That implies to me a very minimalist approach in terms of the statement. In terms of the suggested language changes, the only one I feel strongly about is I don’t like paragraph 6 because I think the timing is odd in the sense that you’re not going to be able to explain it.  People are going to wonder, “Why are you doing this now.”  We’ve already gotten the concept out.  And, two, I just don’t think the language is very good.  I mean, I’ve read the sentence many times, and it’s just a really complicated sentence.  So both in terms of timing and in terms of sentence structure I don’t really like it.  I don’t disagree with the concept at all.  I think the concept is the right one.  It helps explain why the median of the SEP projections is at 2 percent in 2016.  I think it’s important to flesh that out, but I don’t think it’s good for this statement.  In terms of the other suggested changes, I could go either way.  The reality is the first sentence, as written, is accurate.  It’s just a question of is it important enough to include in the statement or not.  And in response to higher mortgage rates, I’m happy taking it out.  I mean, the reality is that paragraph 1 is really supposed to be more of a statement just about what we’re seeing in terms of the data rather than having causal effects in there.  So I guess I’m largely in favor taking out “in response to higher mortgage rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses their personal opinions and preferences regarding certain language changes in the statement, but there is no direct contention or disagreement with any other individual or viewpoint.


Passage number 227.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  I guess there have been some pretty clear suggestions as far as language in alt-B.  Personally, I don’t think the first sentence of B(1) is all that harmful.  It does explain why this meeting has been sort of not, in some sense, as active a meeting as it otherwise would be.  But given the sense of the Committee, I guess I propose that we cut out all the red in B(1)and start the first sentence of B(1) with “information received.” We’ll cut down through “however.”  I have no objection to eliminating “in response to higher mortgage rates” and just simply saying, “While the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months.”  Is there any concern about that.  [No response.]  Seeing none.  B(6) was a close call.  [Laughter]  I’m just joking.  B(6) is apparently before its time, like a fine wine, and so I would suggest that what we would do here is simply go back to paragraph B(5) from September, which essentially means taking the first sentence of B(6), putting it back in B(5) without change, and then eliminating the last sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is giving their personal opinion and proposing a change, and there is no response or objection from others. The mention of "B(6) was a close call" is sarcastic and not indicative of real disagreement.


Passage number 228.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You would not have the word “eventually”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents a fact or opinion without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting information.


Passage number 229.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage does not contain any arguments, conflicting opinions, or contradictory information. It simply presents information without any indication of disagreement.


Passage number 230.
  Paragraph B(5) is identical to B(5) in September MR. EVANS.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 231.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage fails to provide any information or context that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 232.
 MR. EVANS.  While you’re on the last paragraph, could I ask a question, motivated by an observation that Governor Stein made, which I think is perfectly accurate.  When we talk about the equilibrium real interest rate and if you put us in a room and we tried to say what the standard errors are around that, I’m pretty confident that it would be measured in percentage points or things like that, right.  So to say that it’s 2 or whatever it is, we don’t have a lot of confidence.  However, from the previous discussion, I thought what this paragraph was trying to get at was the fact that the SEP in 2016 was showing a funds rate well below what we’ve all said is the long-run neutral rate of 4 percent while we had the unemployment rate close to our assessment of the natural rate and inflation close to our inflation objective.  If I take it at face value that there’s no puzzle about the real interest rate, the implication is that there’s no puzzle for the funds rate being 2 percent; the errors around what we say are so large that you shouldn’t have to explain that as a puzzle.  But I thought this was being offered as—I fully expect to getquestions about this—this is a puzzle.  So therefore, there must be more force behind this.  There must be something inherent in our outlook that suggests to us that we know more about the real rate than it’s just, unconditionally, 1 or 2 percentage points.  That’s just a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a speaker asking for clarification and offering their interpretation of the previous discussion.


Passage number 233.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So I took the sense of the meeting, and in the interest of time, I just struck it.  But I actually think that there’s some value to this at some point.  The SEP in September showed that a substantial majority of the participants expected the funds rate to be quite below 4 percent at the end of 2016; 2 percent was a median value.  I explained it in the September meeting along these lines, and the minutes of the September meeting also said that most people around the table said this headwinds explanation was the right one.  And you can certainly tell the story that given the headwinds—including the fiscal, which is pretty measurable—we think we can achieve full employment, but we’re going to have to do it at lower interest rates.  I mean, obviously that involves Wicksellian concepts and r* and so on, but you certainly can explain it without any highly complex economic points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and explaining a concept without any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 234.
 MR. EVANS.  That’s right, but what I was trying to get at is I think that Governor Stein is exactly correct to say a single statistic doesn’t have a lot of power to shed light on whether or not real rates are, in an equilibrium sense, low because of the headwinds that we’re facing.  But if you get more power from our forecast and everything else that we bring to bear, you’re led to make these types of Wicksellian interpretations.  Yes, I agree completely with your point myself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees completely with the point being made.


Passage number 235.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Like I said, we put it in because we thought it would help explain the September SEP and would get the imprimatur of the Committee that the Committee thinks that low interest rate policies are likely to be necessary for some time.  That all being said, clearly there are a lot of issues here, and it’s something we can continue to discuss as part of ourbroader context of guidance and so on, but I did think it was worth discussing anyway.  So I’m proposing that we go back to B(5).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is mentioning that they included something in an argument in order to explain a concept and gain approval from a committee. They also acknowledge that there are other issues to discuss but still think it is worth discussing.


Passage number 236.
 MR. EVANS.  It strikes me that all of those arguments push back a little bit against the argument that Governor Stein was making, that there’s so much uncertainty we can’t really have confidence our estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making an observation about the arguments presented by Governor Stein.


Passage number 237.
 MR. STEIN:  No, let me if I may.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Stein is simply requesting permission to respond or speak.


Passage number 238.
 MR. EVANS.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 239.
 MR. STEIN:  I think I may have kind of sidetracked us a little bit.  Really all I meant to do was to underscore this distinction between it’s our best forecast and the headwind story is the leading story versus we’re pretty sure that the right funds rate is going to be 2 percent, and that there are standard errors more in the time series than in the cross section.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 240.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Market participants have commented:  How do they know what the rate is going to be in 2016.  So I think your point that there’s just a lot of dispersion around that is certainly true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the point being made by the other market participants.


Passage number 241.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That is certainly true, but we do have a modal forecast, and it’s consequential.  People who are buying and selling 30-year bonds have to make some kind of judgment about what r* is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage expresses agreement and acknowledges the existence of a modal forecast. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 242.
  MR. EVANS.  Right.  No, I am in complete agreement with your explanation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explicitly states that they are in complete agreement with the explanation given.


Passage number 243.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The other two comments that I have here are President Williams on elaborating the forward guidance and President Pianalto on strengthening the statement about asset purchases.  I think the thrust of the meeting was to keep things simple today.  I would comment, President Pianalto, I see where you’re coming from, although there is a sentence very similar to what you suggested in the next paragraph, I think in paragraph 4:  “Injudging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will in coming meetings assess whether incoming information,” and so on.  It’s pretty much in the same spirit of the sentence that you suggested. On President Williams, I found your suggestion about talking about that part of the forward curve being useful, and that’s the reason we put this language in alt-A.  But, again, I think the thrust of the discussion on strategy was that we should take a holistic approach to the refining of our guidance and be careful not to do it in too much of a piecemeal way.  So I would propose that we defer that. Just to summarize, the suggestions I’m proposing on alt-B are dropping the first sentence, dropping the phrase “in response to higher mortgage rates” in B(1), and going back to the old B(5) from the previous meeting.  Are there any questions, comments, reactions.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is responding to comments and suggestions made by President Williams and President Pianalto. The speaker acknowledges their suggestions and offers their own thoughts on the matter. There is no clear disagreement or contention present.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 244.
 MR. EVANS.  I’d just like to restate.  I don’t prefer the path that you’re taking with regard to the first sentence.  I think that the first paragraph is going to appear odd because there’s nothing in the statement that even acknowledges the events since our September meeting.  If you try to make the type of commentary that some have made like, “Oh, don’t we feel better about the decision that we took in September because of what happened after September with regard to the government,” there’s nothing in this statement that gives rise to that justification.  It’s close to clueless on that score.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans disagrees with the path or approach being taken in regards to the first sentence and believes that the first paragraph will seem odd because it does not acknowledge events since their September meeting. Mr. Evans believes that the statement does not provide justification for feeling better about the decision made in September because of subsequent events.


Passage number 245.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, I thought this was a reasonable thing to do.  The one argument though that I heard that made me stop and think was there’s a bit of discussion in markets about how in January and in February and in March there’s going to be yet further rounds of debt brinksmanship and shutdowns and so on and so on, and we don’t want to give theimpression that we’re completely unable to make policy decisions whenever there’s any kind of fiscal issue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is reflecting on their own thoughts and considering a different perspective but does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 246.
 MR. EVANS.  I would have preferred a lighter touch, which simply made an acknowledgement of delays in data.  I did not take that first sentence to really indicate that the actions have been really negative for the economy.  But a way to offset that a little bit would be to at least add a few words around “fiscal policy is restraining economic growth a bit more than we anticipated last time” or something that at least is a delta with regard to the government effects.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans is expressing his personal preference for a different approach and suggesting an addition to the statement without arguing against or contradicting the original statement.


Passage number 247.
 MR. TARULLO.  I agree with President Evans.  I think this is going to look odd.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, expresses agreement with President Evans.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 248.
 MR. FISHER.  May I, Mr. Chairman.  I disagree because there are two references about fiscal policy; there’s one in that very paragraph.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "I disagree" indicates a difference in opinion or point of view.


Passage number 249.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  We talk about fiscal policy, but not the fiscal debates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage merely states that fiscal policy is discussed, but not the fiscal debates. It does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 250.
 MR. FISHER.  You could say “fiscal policy and indecision” if you wanted to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is offering a suggestion or alternative to the statement being made.


Passage number 251.
 MR. TARULLO.  But just to be clear, there is a difference between, on the one hand, talking about the effect of fiscal policy when we are making a judgment about the effect that contracting fiscal policy has had upon the economy and, on the other hand, saying that it’s been more difficult to assess exactly what the effects are.  Obviously I’m not going to vote against this just because of it.  But I think there’s been a lack of precision in people’s critiques.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Tarullo is expressing his opinion about a lack of precision in people's critiques, but there is no opposing viewpoint presented.


Passage number 252.
 MR. FISHER.  If I may just add, Mr. Chairman, I don’t disagree with you.  What I worry about is the trap it sets for the future.  That is, we’re going to have these arguments continually.  We might have another fight about the debt ceiling.  I don’t know if Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan are able to resolve this or not.  It’s our ninth commission in the past three years.  I don’t want to be trapped by this, as the Chairman just said, into not acting in the future,and I believe it sets a precedent for doing that.  I agree that it has limited the amount of information.  I even used that phrase.  It doesn’t match the instrument panel in the picture I gave, but I think including it here unfortunately has long-term consequences, which I would prefer to avoid.  That’s my counterargument, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the Chairman but expressing concerns about the potential consequences and future implications of a certain action. However, there is no direct opposition or disagreement with the Chairman's point of view.


Passage number 253.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 


Passage number 254.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me offer a possible suggestion for a lighter touch that I’m sure all sides will—well, we’ll see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It suggests that the speaker is going to offer a suggestion that may be well received by all sides, but the outcome is uncertain.


Passage number 255.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  I stand to get nothing.  So anything is better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 256.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So the proposed opening sentence for alternative B begins with the word “information.”  I would propose adding the three words “the relatively limited” at the beginning of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is simply discussing a proposed opening sentence for alternative B and suggesting an addition to it.


Passage number 257.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I think that’s a little too strong.  Is there enough support for revisiting this that we should start taking a straw vote or anything like that.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, I think that’s a little too strong. This sentence indicates disagreement or contention with the statement made previously. The speaker disagrees with the strength of the statement.

Is there enough support for revisiting this that we should start taking a straw vote or anything like that. This sentence indicates agreement or support for the idea of revisiting the topic and potentially taking a vote. The speaker believes there is enough support to consider this action.


Passage number 258.
 MR. EVANS.  I’d take it to a straw vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is an excerpt from a conversation where Mr. Evans suggests taking something to a straw vote, indicating a willingness to gather opinions or preferences through a quick informal vote.


Passage number 259.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is there any interest in Governor Tarullo’s suggestion, something like “the effects of the temporary shutdown of the federal government, including delays in release of some data, and uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling debate have made . . .”.  Is there any interest in expanding it that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 260.
 MR. TARULLO.  You could also, Mr. Chairman, put it at the end of paragraph 1 rather than at the beginning.  I thought at least some of what I heard was some concern that it was the principal thing to which we were addressing ourselves.  But, as Charlie says, at this point we’re open to taking anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Tarullo is simply suggesting a different placement of a statement and expressing agreement with Charlie's point of view.


Passage number 261.
  [Laughter]MR. EVANS.  Even if you change the simple sentence “fiscal policies restraining economic growth,” to “fiscal policy continues to restrain economic growth,” the way this will be interpreted is they’re going to put the two statements side by side and they will notice a delta.  At least it will indicate thought.  That’s all, but at the moment it seems to provide zero thought on that, and that’s just a risk that we’re talking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 262.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You could say “fiscal policy and fiscal debates are restraining.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any evidence of contention or disagreement. It simply states that fiscal policy and fiscal debates are restraining.


Passage number 263.
” VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You could say “fiscal policy developments.”  Because that’s a little bit broader.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply providing a suggestion or alternative phrase to use that is slightly more encompassing in its scope.


Passage number 264.
 MR. EVANS.  I’m not arguing that we need to say the shutdown had a big effect.  I’m just saying it has made it somewhat more challenging to assess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Evans, acknowledges the effect of the shutdown but maintains a neutral stance by stating that it has made assessment somewhat more challenging.


Passage number 265.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 266.
 MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, I’ll speak in favor of just doing what you initially proposed, which was to eliminate the first sentence and eliminate the “however.”  I just think that everyone is well aware that the fiscal policy debate and the fiscal uncertainty are affecting the macroeconomic outlook, and it is certainly affecting the deliberations of this Committee.  The effect of this statement will be to say we’re standing pat for today and we’re not really doing anything today, and we’re not trying to send any messages today.  And we understand that lots of things are happening in the world, but we’re just standing pat for today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement in favor of a certain course of action.


Passage number 267.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 268.
 MR. LACKER.  I agree with President Bullard.  It’s worth pointing out the extent to which the staff’s assessment is that the effect of what happened is purely transitory.  We may get another one in January, but again, it’s going to be a purely transitory thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. Lacker and President Bullard agree that the effect of what happened is purely transitory.


Passage number 269.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  To keep things simple how about I ask for a straw vote just to get a sense of the Committee, and if it’s okay, the options are keeping the sentence as written and dropping the sentence.  Is that all right.  Is that acceptable.  Okay.  All in favor of keeping the sentence as written please raise your hand.  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Okay.  All in favor of dropping the sentence.  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply conducting a straw vote to gather the opinion of the committee members on whether to keep or drop a sentence. The results are stated without any discussion or debate.


Passage number 270.
  The Lutherans carry [laughter]— MR. TARULLO:  More religious clashing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement between the Lutherans. It only mentions that they carry laughter, which does not imply any disagreement.


Passage number 271.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Another religious fight.  Okay.  We’re back to where we were.  We’re going to drop the sentence.  We’ll drop the phrase “in response to higher mortgage rates,” and we’ll restore B(5).  For the last time, Ms. Danker, would you please call the roll.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is mainly discussing a decision to drop a sentence and restore another phrase.


Passage number 272.
 MS. DANKER:  Yes.  This vote is on the alternative B, as the Chairman just described, and the associated directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.
