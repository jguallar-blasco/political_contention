Passage number 2.
 Scheld, Senior Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of ChicagoTranscript of Federal Open Market Committee Conference Call ofAugust 22, 1980CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I hope we can be relatively brief thismorning, but I thought it might be a good idea to touch base. I hopeto be out next week and the beginning of the following week, and infact we're going to have a paucity of Governors in Washington duringpart of that period. But we have Mr. Schultz eating lunch at thetable in preparation for leaving this afternoon so that he will behere with full strength next week and able to take care of allproblems.Apart from some prospective absences, we've obviously hadsome big changes in the money figures and I just wanted to run overthe consequences of those changes for the targets and what theprojections are. I assume, as always, that our projections are bothunbiased and not very reliable. They don't necessarily show quite asfrightening a picture as the most recent numbers suggest; the recentnumbers are not very good. Maybe Mr. Ettin can go over where westand--what we are publishing this afternoon, so far as we know at themoment--and what the outlook is as he sees it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 3.
MR. ETTIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states that Mr. Ettin is thanking the Chairman. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this statement.


Passage number 4.
 This afternoon we willbe publishing an upward revision to the August 6th M-1A that will showan increase from the previous week of--MR. TIMLEN. We can't hear at all in New York.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 5.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Could you hear me all that easily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about their own audibility.


Passage number 6.
MR. TIMLEN. I can hear you, Paul, but that's all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Timlen simply states that he can hear Paul, without expressing any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 7.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll get Mr. Ettin to a different station[and microphone].SPEAKER(.). Put him here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence is a statement urging someone to move Mr. Ettin to a different station and microphone.


Passage number 8.
MR. ETTIN. Can you hear now.SPEAKER(.). Quite well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both parties seem to be in agreement that the speaker can hear well.


Passage number 9.
MR. ETTIN. All right. This afternoon we will be publishinga revision for the week of August 6th, which will show that M-1A wasup $9.7 billion instead of the previously published $8.2 billion. ForM-1B we will publish a revised August 6th figure that will be up $10.4billion rather than the previously published $8.9 billion. For theweek of the 13th, to be published for the first time this afternoon,we will show for M-1A a decline of $3.6 billion from the upwardrevised August 6th level and for M-1B a decline of $3.4 billion fromthe revised August 6th level.Board Staff estimates based on the preliminary data throughAugust 20th suggest that M-1A in August will rise at a 15 percent[annual] rate and M-1B at a 17-1/4 percent rate. Our projection forSeptember for M-1A at this time is for virtually no change; and forM-1B we estimate growth of perhaps between 1 and 2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply presenting revised figures and projections.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 10.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me say just one other thing: What8/22/80obviously partial and not very reliable data we have for the week ofthe 20th indicate a decline of $1 to $1-1/2 billion, so that Septemberfigure is not projecting anything startling other than some mildincrease from a lower level that we would have reached at the end ofAugust. It's not out of the clear blue sky in that sense. It doesn'trequire any heroic assumptions as to what happens in September; itjust says September will increase a little from what we now think thelatter part of August will be. So what falls out of that ispractically an unchanged September on a daily average basis.Obviously these August figures look very big; if we could put anyweight on the September figure--and obviously we can't put all thatmuch weight on it--the two months together are not all thatstartlingly above what we were talking about. I have those figureshere someplace.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the phrase "Obviously these August figures look very big; if we could put any weight on the September figure--and obviously we can't put all that much weight on it--the two months together are not all that startlingly above what we were talking about." The speaker suggests that the September figure is not as significant as it may seem, and the two months together are not significantly higher than previously discussed. This implies a disagreement or differing viewpoint.


Passage number 11.
MR. ETTIN. For the two months, the Board's staff would belooking at about an 8 percent increase as opposed to the "about 6percent" that was targeted by the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Ettin, is simply providing information about the projected increase in the Board's staff, stating that it would be around 8 percent instead of the targeted 6 percent.


Passage number 12.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, that's right. [For the thirdquarter] M-1B is a little less than 9-1/2 percent as against [theCommittee's objective of about] 8 percent. And M2 is practically whatwe said on these projections. M2 has been running a little lowrelative to the other numbers--it was running high as you recall andwe had some discussion of it--partly because growth in money marketfunds has turned negative now. So we're very close on theseprojections to the M2 target for this quarter. For M-1A and M-1Bwe're clearly above, but it's not by any means out of sight [evenwith] the August figure, if the September number is more or lessright.What this implies for reserve targeting, as we discussed atthe meeting, is that of course the borrowings go up. The path has notbeen worked out in any detail; it is complicated by the fact that wehad a substantial miss in the last week, which meant we had morenonborrowed reserves than we thought we had and less borrowings on theother side. So there's a judgmental question on the path as towhether to let that bygone be a bygone or whether mechanically to makeup for it in the rest of the period. In any event whatever adjustmentwe make, we would expect the borrowings to go up and they reallyhaven't gone up yet. But the market has certainly been anticipatingsome tightening and it's a question of how much the markets are goingto react to these figures today. Peter may want to comment on that.My sense of it is that the figures aren't going to make them happy,but I don't know. I'm not sure they are so bad that it will provoke abig further adjustment. Peter, do you have some comment on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information and expressing some uncertainty about how the markets will react to the figures.


Passage number 13.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I think at first blush they will be slightlypleased at the approximately $3-1/2 billion decline. Then they'll getto looking at the upward revision and become a little more concernedabout it. On balance, I think it's going to be a slight negative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. It mainly presents the speaker's prediction and assessment of the situation, without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 14.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know whether Mr. Kichline wants toreport on any economic data we have had in the past week. We had aconsumer price index this morning, which you probably all know about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple statement providing information without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 15.
MR. KICHLINE. Yes. The consumer price index this morning,as you know, showed no change. It was a bit lower than we had8/22/80anticipated. Food prices, although rising, rose a little less than weexpected; and the mortgage rate contributed a major influence anddeclined substantially. We expect the mortgage rate to go downfurther in the CPI index for next month. We've also received neworders figures, which were up appreciably for total durable goods andthey rose for nondefense capital goods also. We do not believe,however, that the current [GNP] forecast for the third quarter,showing a decline of 4 percent or so, would be changed on the basis ofthe information that has become available since the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information about different economic indicators and their current status. There is no conflicting opinion or argument presented.


Passage number 16.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We, of course, had a bad producer priceindex. That was since the meeting, wasn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact and confirming that the bad producer price index occurred since the meeting.


Passage number 17.
MR. KICHLINE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 18.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Having that big increase in producerprices didn't help the market, obviously. Market participants may belooking at that more than the consumer prices because they can dismissthe consumer price number as a mortgage phenomenon. But the consumerprice index did not look too bad outside the mortgage area. As Iremember it was 0.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The passage presents different viewpoints on the impact of the increase in producer prices on the market. While one perspective suggests that the increase did not help the market, another viewpoint argues that market participants may be looking more closely at consumer prices and dismissing the consumer price number as a mortgage phenomenon. This difference in perspectives indicates disagreement or contention.


Passage number 19.
6 outside--MR. KICHLINE. That's right. If you take out the mortgagecomponent, it was up 0.6 percent, which is unchanged from the rate ofincrease in the preceding month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 20.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have had a very substantialadjustment in the longer-term rate area and, of course, we've had anadjustment in the short-term rate area, too. I don't have the figuresin front of me, but my impression is that the adjustment in long-termrates is as big or bigger than the adjustment in short-term rates,which is somewhat of an abnormal experience. We have essentially anunchanged economic situation from what we thought before.I would just say that I feel a little sensitive about themanner in which we conduct our open market operations. [I'm talking]not in terms of anything we've done which needed to be done, but Ithink we should try to avoid resolving any doubts on the side oftaking overt action in the market at a time when the market is alreadyvery sensitive--if we can get by with it consistent with the path.Just as a matter of judging hourly operations or daily operations--butit's a tricky business--I wouldn't want to see any unnecessarymessages sent to the market, consistent with the kind of path and theanticipation of higher borrowings that we have. The discount rate, ofcourse, is at 10 percent. And with this level of borrowings one wouldexpect--as with any significant level of borrowings, which we arecertainly looking for--that the funds rate would normally trade abovethe discount rate. I think that's the prospect we face based upon theinformation we know at the moment. How much of that has beendiscounted in the market, I don't know. I don't know whether anybodyelse has any comments they want to make at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any statements or arguments that create contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of the speaker expressing their thoughts and concerns about conducting open market operations and the current economic situation.


Passage number 21.
MR. SCHULTZ. Do you want to tell [the Presidents] what wedid with the discount rate this morning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a question being asked by Mr. Schultz.


Passage number 22.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Fred is just saying that we did, after arelatively short debate and purely because of the potential confusioninvolved, accept the proposals we had from several Reserve Banks to8/22/80conform this ineligible paper discount rate to the regular discountrate on September 1st. The announcement will present this as anaction taken to bring those rates in conformity in the light of theauthority and the basic intention implied by the Monetary Control Act.In Mr. Coyne's professional judgment, it will get no attention in thepress. We will see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 23.
MR. ROOS. Paul, Larry Roos. Is there any intention towithdraw some reserves in order to compensate for the overshoot in thelast week or so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 24.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. By "overshoot" you mean the error in thenonborrowed reserve figure, I assume.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is seeking clarification or confirmation about the meaning of "overshoot."


Passage number 25.
MR. ROOS. Yes, sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply responds with "Yes, sir" in agreement or affirmation.


Passage number 26.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That probably falls into an area of somediscretion. It amounts to something like $70 million when averagedover the remaining weeks, so we're not talking about a huge number.But I would be inclined not to be very eager to make up for thatovershoot depending upon whether we overtly had to take it out or not.That would be my judgment. In other words, if it made the differencebetween going into the market overtly, particularly in an atmospherewhere the market is already weak, I would swallow it. If the marketmakes it up itself without us--because that's the way the operatingfactors are going--then it would be okay. That judgment has to bemade almost from day to day, but that's the way I would look at it,Larry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal judgment and preferences regarding a financial matter.


Passage number 27.
MR. ROOS. Where did the reserves come from to support themoney supply increase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the following passage.


Passage number 28.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where did the reserves come from tosupport the money supply increase. They didn't come from anywhere.That's the trouble. We have a lagged reserve accounting system and noreserves are needed to support it in the first instance. So whatwe're basically talking about is how many of those reserves have tocome out of borrowing now that it's effective in the market, I guessthis week. We're saying that those reserves basically have to comeout of borrowing. That is the normal path assumption: That thoseadditional reserves will come out of borrowing. Now, what will happento excess reserves and whether we will get another error or whatever[is another question], but the normal [assumption in terms] of thepath is that those reserves come out of borrowing. The reason thereserve miss was in the most recent week, not the week when the moneysupply went [up]--was that the week before that they had to put up thereserves for the money supply increase. Well, I don't know, I getmixed up regarding the particular weeks, but the reserve miss was notin the week that the money supply increased. And it was due to floaton the last day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation about how reserves are used to support the increase in the money supply.


Passage number 29.
MR. CORRIGAN. Paul, this is Jerry Corrigan. I understandwhat you said about the problems the staff is having with the path.But what is the sense, [given] everything we know right now, as towhat may happen to the funds rate in the immediate period ahead--inthe next couple of weeks or so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement asking for information and clarification.


Passage number 30.
8/22/80CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We would expect it to be up, based uponwhat we know now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states an expectation based on currently available information.


Passage number 31.
MR. CORRIGAN. I appreciate that. Is there any sense of howmuch it might have to go up given what's going to happen to borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing appreciation for the information provided and asking for more clarification.


Passage number 32.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What is the rate now, 10-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply asks about the current interest rate.


Passage number 33.
MR. ETTIN. 10 to 10-1/4.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This statement does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a numerical range.


Passage number 34.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suppose it could go up in theneighborhood of a percentage point under normal relationships.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as an assumption or possibility.


Passage number 35.
MR. PARTEE. As high as 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The given passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a statement without any conflicting views or opposing arguments.


Passage number 36.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. As you know, these are not veryclose relationships, but that's the average implication I guess. AllI am saying is that it's one thing if that [increase] seems to behappening kind of normally. I don't particularly want to give themarket the idea that we have a higher funds rate target. That's thepoint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion on not wanting to give the market the idea of a higher funds rate target.


Passage number 37.
MR. CORRIGAN. I appreciate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not include any statements or indications of contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing gratitude or appreciation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 38.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not responding to your directquestion, Larry, but let me ask a different question, which issomewhat related. It is very troublesome to me, and I am sure toother people, that the money supply can jump up by $9 or $10 billionin a week the way it [apparently has recently]. That is a monthlyincrease in the money supply that's half the normal increase for awhole year. And nobody knows why. I have gotten no enlightenment onit either. Well, we think some of it may have been due to socialsecurity payments, but the staff presumably tried to adjust for thatin the seasonal. So even there, [though] we know the social securitypayment has an impact on the money supply it is not clear that thatwasn't adjusted out.We haven't had much guidance here. I haven't heard anyreasons from the experts in New York and I haven't heard any plausibleexplanations from the market. Here we have, as I say, a money supplyincrease in a week that's equal to roughly half of the normal increasefor a year, and nobody in the world seems to have even much of aspeculation as to what is going on, what caused it, and whether it's[temporary]. Well, we have some sense that it is temporary; wenaturally think it tends to be temporary simply because it's so big.And the most recent data somewhat confirm that, at least in a partialsense. All I am saying is that if anybody has any acute insights asto what has been going on in the last few weeks, I would be veryinterested in hearing them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The author expresses frustration and confusion about the sudden increase in the money supply and the lack of clear explanations from experts or the market. They state that nobody seems to have a speculation or insight into what caused the increase and whether it is temporary or not. This suggests disagreement or disagreement with the current state of understanding about the situation.


Passage number 39.
MR. SCHULTZ. Let's call Milt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting viewpoints or arguments. It is a statement or suggestion by Mr. Schultz to call someone named Milt.


Passage number 40.
MR. GRAMLEY. May I make just one comment. This is GovernorGramley speaking. Am I heard out there.SPEAKER(.). No.SPEAKER(.). Take the chair, the hot seat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. There is a request for attention and clarification, but no conflict or differing opinions.


Passage number 41.
8/22/80CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have only two chairs from which anybodyout there can hear anything, apparently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of fact about the availability of chairs for people to sit and listen.


Passage number 42.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, one thing that seems to me evident--unless we have had a major error in our forecast of real activity orprices in the third quarter and I don't think we have--is thatvelocity has dropped substantially in the quarter. I don't see anyreasons for doubting the staff's view that real GNP is going down atan annual rate of about 4 percent or so, and therefore we've got onlya very small increase in nominal GNP. If that view is right, thengiven the pattern of interest rates, we've had a tremendous drop invelocity in the third quarter. Given that fact, we have to askourselves whether or not what we're seeing is a reversal, or a partialreversal at least, of the movement in the money demand function thatwe couldn't understand in the second quarter. And if we didn'tunderstand it in the second quarter, we also may never understand itspartial move back in the third. So I believe we ought to take thatinto account in our thinking about how to handle this. I certainlywouldn't want to send any signals to the market that we regard this asa need for tightening up now. And I would want to use everyopportunity to keep market rates from moving up too rapidly. As thefigures on the table indicate, we're looking at an M-1A number forSeptember that is still barely over the low end of the target range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and views, but there is no indication of disagreement with other speakers or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 43.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Let me go over those numbers, Lyle,because I meant to do it and I forgot. I described it. I said thatif the September forecast is right, with all its uncertainty, [moneysupply growth] is not widely out [of line] with what we were talkingabout at the Committee meeting. But if we look at it on an annualbasis in terms of the targets--if we take the August number that wenow have, which should be becoming a reasonably good number, and if weput any weight on the preliminary numbers we have for the next week--we're hovering around the lower end of the range on M-1A. On M-1Bwe're clearly above the middle; if the September figure came out [asprojected], growth would probably get back to slightly below themidpoint. I indicated that M2 was a little weaker relative to M-1Aand M-1B but M2 continues to be slightly above the upper end of itsrange. But that's about where we had it at the time of the Committeemeeting.So if we look at all those numbers in terms of the annual[objectives], while the rate of increase is obviously very steep inrecent months, going into September and even more so going out ofSeptember it leaves us with numbers that look quite like what we weretalking about at the meeting--with M-1A low, M2 high, M-1B in between.And M3, though I don't have those numbers, I think is still very muchin the middle of the range. Now that final sentence depended uponSeptember in fact not showing much change; but even the August figuresare not wildly out of line at all. What is out of line obviously isthe angle of inclination for July and August.Just in reference to this August figure--and Lyle put it inthe perspective of the quarter more or less--that is still somewhatdisturbing to me. While one can begin making somewhat plausibleexplanations of why the quarter as a whole should act this way--[attributing] it to a make-up, which is a bit reassuring in a sense--Istill have some nagging questions about the whole technique in termsof how in the world the money supply can go up by $10 billion in one8/22/80week. Again, that is not very far from half the annual growth patternand it bothers me, particularly since it didn't all come [out] thefollowing week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion of numbers and figures related to money supply growth.


Passage number 44.
MR. ROOS. Paul, do your people have any estimates of themonetary base for this last week, in terms of billions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question asking for estimates of the monetary base.


Passage number 45.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ettin is looking up the number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 46.
MR. ETTIN. For the week of August 20th, our estimate of themonetary base would be $158.7 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply providing an estimate of the monetary base for the week of August 20th.


Passage number 47.
MR. ROOS. Compared to what the previous week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a comparison being made by Mr. Roos.


Passage number 48.
MR. ETTIN. Unfortunately on this table, I don't have thedata prior to August 20th.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of fact.


Passage number 49.
MR. BECK. And that's not seasonally adjusted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply stating a fact without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 50.
MR. ETTIN. And that figure is not seasonally adjusted,President Roos.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact about a figure that is not seasonally adjusted.


Passage number 51.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We don't have any of those base figureshere. Does anybody here have them. It's a figure that's on the usualtable that I see on a Monday but apparently it's not here on a Friday.We don't have it right here but if you want to wait for a minute, thestaff will extract the table. The last time I looked--but it didn'treflect the latest week's figures--nothing extraordinary seemed to begoing on [in the base]. That figure, of course, is very heavilyweighted by currency. Do you have the currency component.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the lack of certain figures and asking if anyone else has them.


Passage number 52.
MR. ETTIN. Yes. Currency [growth] on the Board estimateshas been relatively strong, although somewhat less than projected.Currency in July was growing at almost a 12 percent rate and in Augustat almost a 14 percent rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the fact that currency growth on the Board estimates has been relatively strong, although slightly less than projected, with specific growth rates provided for July and August.


Passage number 53.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But it didn't do anything in that week orin the subsequent week, did it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing a fact and seeking confirmation.


Passage number 54.
MR. ETTIN. In the week of August 6th, it was a very smallproportion of the increase. Currency only increased $800 million inthat week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states a fact about the increase in currency during a specific week. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 55.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I am sure the base didn't increase much inthat week, simply because currency didn't go up very much. What wasit the following week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a personal belief or assumption and there is no clear contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 56.
MR. ETTIN. On the 13th, it declined $400 million to $113billion. Currency has not played a major role.SPEAKER(.). Will you repeat that.

Passage number 57.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I am just trying to judge whetherthe base went up, which is the figure we haven't got. It probablydidn't go up all that much if currency was acting that way. We'retrying to get that figure on the telephone at the moment.Nobody has a solution to my money supply riddle.

Passage number 75.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, as I say, the staff tried to adjustthat out, though they readily concede that adjusting it out is not an8/22/80exact science. But the total impact theoretically can't be more than4 [billion dollars]. And they did make an adjustment, so presumablyit can't really be 4.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information and acknowledges that adjusting the impact is not an exact science.

Explanation: The passage does not exhibit any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement or question about the possible reasons behind the shift in payment mechanisms of banks.


Passage number 77.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think that may explain some of thediscrepancy between M-1A and M-1B that we've been seeing for someweeks. But that can't explain the increase in both of them on the8th. Just the fact that it comes right at the beginning of the month--and of course we've had this phenomenon before, though less big insize--makes one suspicious that there's something about the monthlypatterns here that somehow affects these numbers. But I can't imaginewhat it would be. Well, there's no point in belaboring the issue.I'll just express my mystification about it. It's a somewhatdisturbing phenomenon just from the standpoint of our inability toexplain it, apart from being disturbing in terms of our objectives,the impact on the market psychology, and all the rest. But if nobodyelse has any comment, I guess we can draw this to a conclusion. Ithink the main message is that while this is very troublesome, itdoesn't look quite as bad when put in a fuller perspective as it maylook to us and to the market on first blush.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing confusion and concern about a phenomenon but does not argue with or challenge any other perspectives or viewpoints.

Passage number 79.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And this all is based on a presumption forwhich we have some [evidence]. It's more than shooting in the dark tosay that August is on a downward trend after the big jump up. But Idon't think we can say much more than that. And if that is borne outin September, we will be quite on track.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.
