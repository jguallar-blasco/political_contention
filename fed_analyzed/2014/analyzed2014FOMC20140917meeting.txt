Passage number 1.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Our first topic is financial developments and open market operations.  I’m going to turn it over to Simon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants are expressing agreement and are moving forward without objection.


Passage number 2.
 MR. FISHER.  May I ask a question on the federal funds market and the FBO arbitrage for the FHLBs that you mentioned.  You may have put this in a memo—and we’ve noted the arbitrage—but are we talking about a significant number.  What is the dollar amount that we’re talking about.  The reason I raise this is because in the back of my head I’m just thinking of the politics of this.  Is this something that really is significant, or is it insignificant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by Mr. Fisher, seeking clarification on the dollar amount related to the federal funds market and FBO arbitrage for the FHLBs. The mention of politics is just a consideration in the speaker's mind.


Passage number 3.
 MR. POTTER.  It’s hard for us to know the marginal profit they earn for the reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not include any explicit disagreement or contention. It is a statement expressing difficulty in knowing the marginal profit earned by an unspecified group.


Passage number 4.
 MR. FISHER.  They wouldn’t be doing it if they weren’t earning something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not involve any disagreement or contention. It simply states that "They wouldn't be doing it if they weren't earning something." This is a general statement without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 5.
 MR. POTTER.  If it is $50 billion and it is 10 basis points, that is not a large number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is simply making a statement about the size of a certain number.


Passage number 6.
 MR. FISHER.  Right, and that’s roughly what we’re talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply agrees with the statement.


Passage number 7.
 MR. POTTER.   I’m just making an assumption there, I think.  Their balance sheet costs right now are a little bit lower than U.S. banks, which is why you see them hold more reserves through this type of transaction.  Those balance sheets will go up, and it might not be profitable at that point for someone to hold it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing an assumption and explaining the potential impact of the situation.


Passage number 8.
 MR. FISHER.  So this is not likely to attract much attention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is a simple statement made by Mr. Fisher without any indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 9.
 MR. POTTER.  Probably not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is likely contention or disagreement in the passage. The presence of the word "Probably" suggests that there is a certain level of uncertainty or disagreement about the statement being made.


Passage number 10.
   MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 11.
 MR. POWELL.  I understand that the SEP is measuring more of a modal outcome, and so, frankly, are a lot of the surveys, and that markets are more risk-neutral, as you put it.  If you account for that, I’m still trying to work out how closely in alignment they are, particularly at the short end where I think it matters, between now and the liftoff.  Intuitively, it seems like there’s not a big disconnect there, but I wonder how you think about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing a desire to understand how closely aligned the measurements and surveys are, particularly in relation to the short term leading up to the liftoff. They also express their intuitive belief that there is not a significant disconnect.


Passage number 12.
 MR. POTTER.  The evidence we have suggests that you can reconcile the difference you see in the first chart.  I don’t think we want to try too hard to come up with special reasons as to why there might be a gap, though, because there clearly is a gap.  We were most interested in the most obvious one.  Either you don’t lift off, or you do lift off and you come back down to zero.  There’s a reasonable probability of 20 percent that you don’t successfully lift off.  Then you should look at some of the market pricing as being moved up by about a factor of 1.2 to capture that, relative to some of the paths that the people around this room and other participants give, in which you successfully lift off because the economic outlook they’re basing it on doesn’t have the economy getting weaker, the economy gets stronger. There’s also some differences to do with the SEP talking about ranges for the federal funds rate, and we took the midpoint of that.  There’s a little bit of discrepancy between where the federal funds rate would actually trade as well as where LIBOR would be and these types of charts, and that can explain some of that as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining different factors that can explain the gap shown in the charts.


Passage number 13.
 MR. POWELL.  Bottom line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply presents the statement from Mr. Powell without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 14.
 MR. POTTER.  Bottom line, I’m less concerned than I was at the last meeting, seeing the results of this survey.  However, we can’t just take one question and feel that this is simply   resolved.  The change in the last week of people’s views on the forward guidance was reasonably substantial.  And, interestingly, you’ve seen some moves in the market path, but not substantial moves.  That would also be consistent with the distribution of the types of paths, which would make the average look different from the mode.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Although the speaker is highlighting some changes and observations, there is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their perspective and analyzing the situation.


Passage number 15.
 MR. POWELL.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota, did you have a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The conversation seems to be polite and collaborative.


Passage number 16.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No, I had a one-hander. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange of information.


Passage number 17.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just wanted to follow up on this a little bit.  You’re saying that, in the SEP, participants are not putting some probability on the idea that you go back to the zero bound.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification or additional information.


Passage number 18.
 MR. POTTER.  I carefully said, “most likely reflects the modal path based on the modal outlook.”  I don’t actually know how you put it together.  It is possible that some of you allow for that, and yours is more of an expectation.  Instead of being risk-neutral, it would take out that risk premium.  Then the adjustment would be what is the risk premium embedded in market prices, which you don’t have in your forecast.  That’s the adjustment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing an explanation and clarifying their understanding of the topic.


Passage number 19.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, I mean, if you’re using an empirical model and there’s some tail of the probability distribution that’s going to draw some shocks that’ll send you back to the zero bound, then that should be incorporated in the typical person’s thinking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Bullard about incorporating the possibility of shocks that could lead to a return to the zero bound in empirical models.


Passage number 20.
 MR. POTTER.  If the reporting from the people around this table is the mathematical expectation from those models, it should correspond more closely to the market path.  The instructions are to base it, I believe, on the most likely outcomes for the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. Mr. Potter is simply stating that the reporting should correspond more closely to the market path if it is based on the most likely outcomes for the economy.


Passage number 21.
 MR. BULLARD.  Just one more question on this.  Have we had gaps like this in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states that there is a question to be asked about past gaps, but it does not suggest any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 22.
   MR. POTTER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context to suggest contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Potter said "yes," but there is no indication of what he is responding to or any conflict in the passage.


Passage number 23.
 MR. BULLARD.  What has been the explanation in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply asks for an explanation.


Passage number 24.
 MR. POTTER.  I haven’t done detailed work on this recently.  Frequently, it depends—at this point, when we’re entering into a tightening cycle, perhaps, it’s not uncommon for the market to be underpricing the path that policy would actually take.  That’s a common feature that we found.  When you’re entering the point of a loosening cycle, it tends to be the other way around.  The market is more in front—they expect more to happen. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley, a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Potter and Chair Yellen are discussing different aspects of the market's expectations of policy tightening or loosening cycles. They are providing different perspectives on the market's behavior without conflicting with each other.


Passage number 25.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Isn’t it true that the market participants have pulled in their expectations of the timing of the initial tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is stating a rhetorical question, which suggests that the market participants have indeed adjusted their expectations regarding the timing of initial tightening. There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 26.
 MR. POTTER.  They have moved that in a way consistent with the economic data, clearly.  The mystery has been the lines in chart 1.  The market pricings haven’t moved as much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the movement of market pricings in relation to economic data and how the lines in chart 1 have been a mystery.


Passage number 27.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without providing the passage or any context, it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 28.
 MR. POTTER.  We are searching for explanations as to why they have not moved as much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Potter and others are searching for explanations for something.


Passage number 29.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Isn’t it true, too, that if you actually tried to write down what the confidence intervals were around those future paths, that maybe the Committee would be at 50 percent and the market would be at 40 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 30.
 MR. POTTER.  You can do that.  That is certainly one thing.  If you look at the implied volatilities or you look at model-based estimates, this kind of discrepancy between the red dots here and the lines is not really worth that much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While the passage presents two different perspectives (implied volatilities and model-based estimates), there is no explicit disagreement or contention expressed. The speaker is simply stating that the discrepancy between the red dots and the lines does not hold significant value.


Passage number 31.
   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have so much uncertainty about 2016 and 2017, I don’t view the difference in my view and the market view as meaningful relative to the uncertainty associated with my view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is an expression of personal uncertainty and an acknowledgment that comparing one's own view to the market view is not significant in the face of the overall uncertainty.


Passage number 32.
 MR. POTTER.  The only thing I’d say is, chart 2 does put a rather low weight on a tightening cycle that looks like 2004 to 2006.  That’s probably driven by the fact that people’s view of the long-run neutral rate has come down a lot since 2004.  There’s not that far you can actually go over two years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Potter is simply making an observation about the weight given to a tightening cycle in chart 2 and giving a potential reason for it.


Passage number 33.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a polite exchange between two individuals.


Passage number 34.
   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Actually, my questions are about the same chart.  I guess I have a comment and a question.  One comment is on whether or not we should be thinking about using risk-neutral expectations or mathematical statistical expectations to engage in these things.  I think the risk-neutral expectations actually embody variations in state prices that reflect how households and businesses actually are weighting the value of resources across different states.  If we’re going back to the zero lower bound, that’s probably not good news, and resources are going to be relatively expensive.  I actually think there’s an argument to be made to be thinking about the risk-neutral expectation as being of use.  That’s the comment. My question is, you say that the discrepancy can be rationalized by embedding a probability of returning to the zero lower bound.  What duration of stay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 35.
 MR. POTTER.  Well, this was within the two years after liftoff.  It’s a complicated question to ask.  We asked, “What is the probability that within two years after liftoff”—so, any   time—“that you return to the zero bound.”  Conditional on not returning to the zero bound, what did you think the path and timing would look like over those two years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply posing a complicated question and seeking input or thoughts on the matter.


Passage number 36.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I see.  To fill in the gap, didn’t you have to make an assumption about how long.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification by asking a question.


Passage number 37.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Oh, yes, there are a lot of unspecified things there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 38.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes, we thought the results were sensible.  However, there are a lot of paths you could take.  The way you were supposed to answer this, if any of those paths after liftoff within two years hit the zero bound again, throw them out and just look at the set of paths in your head that didn’t hit the zero bound again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that the results were sensible, but suggests an alternative approach in case any of the paths hit the zero bound again. This does not indicate disagreement, but rather a suggestion for improving the analysis.


Passage number 39.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But, Simon, you offered the possibility that this discrepancy is responsible for the gap between the SEP rate forecasts and market assessments.  To do that, you had to fill in that 20 percent somehow explicitly, and I was trying to get at how you filled it in, in terms of duration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question and does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 40.
 MR. POTTER.  Nothing too complicated.  I took this line and scaled it by about 1.2.  [Laughter]  We could try and do something more complicated than that, and we could think of different ways.  But if it was the case that they were 100 percent confident that you wouldn’t be returning to the zero bound over this period, then there is a substantial discrepancy because markets are just saying you’re going to behave differently than the way you think they’re going to behave along that path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting a hypothetical situation and discussing the potential discrepancy between market behavior and the speaker's expectations.


Passage number 41.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a polite exchange of gratitude.


Passage number 42.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 43.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m actually going to switch gears a little bit to the euro-area questions or issues raised in charts 10 and 11, which I really found helpful in   thinking through this.  The way I read this is that Mario Draghi has made these public statements.  You’ve surveyed market participants or the primary dealers around their views on this, and this is based on what’s currently in the market and market pricing around everything.  If you thought about a downside risk, in which disinflationary or deflationary pressures were more severe or the euro area fell, the economy stagnated even more, what are the tools that could be coming into play here, in terms of thinking about what their options are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 44.
 MR. POTTER.  I’ll let Steve go first on that one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they will allow someone named Steve to go first on a particular topic.


Passage number 45.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, only because I’ll be covering that in my remarks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating that they will address a certain topic in their remarks.


Passage number 46.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 47.
 WILLIAMS.  Okay.  I’ll defer the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Williams, agrees to defer the question, suggesting there is no argument or disagreement present.


Passage number 48.
 MR. KAMIN.  The short answer is, buying government bonds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 49.
 MR. POTTER.  You can easily buy government bonds really quickly—as we’ve shown, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England.  It’s harder to buy some of these private-sector assets, particularly in the euro area, because you have to think about individual countries.  Some of them are retained on the bank’s balance sheet.  Whether lifting their triple-A off the bank’s balance sheet gives you any relief at all is not clear, because there are a lot of operational challenges to get to this number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting information about the ease of buying government bonds compared to private-sector assets, particularly in the euro area. They also mention that the impact of removing triple-A assets from the bank's balance sheet is not clear due to operational challenges.


Passage number 50.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage as there is no context or information provided.


Passage number 51.
 WILLIAMS.  To make my question more precise, within the items on chart 11, there’s not a lot of scope beyond what they have already announced or talked about to do more there.  It really has to move to this other tool.  Is that right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 52.
 MR. POTTER.  The previous public bond program was supposed to be quite large, and they got nowhere close to the limit there.  The ABS, they all have to use that.  Asset managers are supposed to buy this.  It’s unlikely to get there quickly.  That means if we do see inflation expectations falling or further weakness, they’ve really said that they’ve got some gain from   saying their balance sheet is going to get bigger.  They’ll have to find a way of getting it bigger.  They can do it through other financing operations, perhaps.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is describing a potential scenario and predicting future actions. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 53.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 54.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention; it is a simple exchange of gratitude and acknowledgement.


Passage number 55.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to follow up on the tail-end of the exchange with Vice Chairman Dudley.  You remarked on how the longer-run expectations for the short rate are pretty soft relative to the SEP numbers.  To what extent do you have any evidence or any sense that that’s connected to the last sentence of our statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides a question and not a statement, so there is no contention or disagreement evident.


Passage number 56.
 MR. POTTER.  We’ve talked about this previously.  I’d say that the last sentence has been reasonably powerful in combination with some statements the previous Chairman made and some large asset managers, in terms of the market’s view.  What’s happened over the past few months with the decline in long forwards has confirmed those viewpoints.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing previous discussions and stating that recent events have confirmed certain viewpoints.


Passage number 57.
 MR. LACKER.  Interesting.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any further questions for Simon.  [No response]  Okay.  Let’s next turn to the overnight RRP program.  We will need to vote today on the resolution that’s been distributed.  But before we do that, any questions and comments concerning that.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states the need to vote on a resolution and asks if there are any questions or comments.


Passage number 58.
 MR. POWELL.  Am I reading chart number 20 correctly, that the expected size after liftoff is somewhere between $500 billion and $600 billion.  That’s the average.  Can you unpack that a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Powell is simply seeking clarification or further explanation of the chart.


Passage number 59.
 MS. LOGAN.  Right.  Chart 20 shows the evolution of expected overnight RRP usage for those who expect the 25 basis point spread to remain over that time period, and that is about 15 of our total respondents.  As you see, the average moves around.  The median comes down a   little bit three years following liftoff, but the dispersion is quite a bit wider three years out.  There’s just less certainty across the respondents about what that would look like.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is simply stating the data presented on Chart 20 without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 60.
 MR. POWELL.  That’s a mean, not a median.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a factual statement about the difference between a mean and a median. It does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 61.
 MR. POTTER.  The diamond is the mean.  The line is the median.  The guys who have these very high numbers are driving up the mean relative to median.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

The passage suggests that there is contention or disagreement regarding the relationship between the mean and the median in reference to the diamond and the high numbers. It implies that the high numbers are causing the mean to be higher compared to the median.


Passage number 62.
 MS. LOGAN.  If you look at the full population, not controlling for the spread, the medians look similar.  The averages are a bit lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage states that the medians look similar when not controlling for the spread and the averages are a bit lower. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this statement, just a comparison of two statistics.


Passage number 63.
 MR. POWELL.  I mean, it looks like people are not taking seriously the idea that this is a $300 billion exercise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 64.
 MR. POTTER.  Well, the $300 billion is the number they don’t know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a statement by Mr. Potter regarding the $300 billion, indicating uncertainty or lack of knowledge about the mentioned number. There is no indication of contention or disagreement as the statement is simply presenting an unknown or uncertain fact.


Passage number 65.
 MR. POWELL.  Was it in the minutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply mentions Mr. Powell and asks whether something was in the minutes.


Passage number 66.
 MR. POTTER.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 67.
 MR. POWELL.  Ah, okay.  It wasn’t in the minutes.  I thought it was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 68.
 MR. POTTER.  The conversations that we’ve had recently, the number of people who expect it to be a trillion has definitely dropped, and you can see that a little bit in chart 19.  We took out some outliers to form that one.  For us, the interesting thing is why, a year after liftoff, did it tend to look a little bit larger.  Some of the uncertainties you’re going to have to deal with are regulatory changes, and whether the zero bound is providing some protection right now.  As you get further away from zero, you have less protection from the zero bound.  So you need more support for the magnet from interest on excess reserves to achieve interest rate control.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing data and observations related to chart 19 and expressing thoughts and considerations about certain factors that may affect interest rate control.


Passage number 69.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further comments or questions.  Vice Chairman Dudley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a polite exchange where Mr. Powell thanks Chair Yellen and Chair Yellen asks if there are any further comments or questions.


Passage number 70.
   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just wanted to talk a little bit about the testing program.  I think what the staff proposes, of doing it in two stages, makes sense.  Governor Tarullo and Governor Powell circulated a memo that maybe suggested that you could do it in one stage, but I think that two stages is actually a little bit better because you don’t overwhelm participants with a whole bunch of potential changes all at once.  It is easier to discern what each change does in terms of the testing process.  I also think that if you have the testing in phases, you get the advantage of the first phase informing what you want to test in the second phase, which you maybe don’t have to quite the same degree if you do it all in one phase.  At the end of the day, I don’t think it’s really consequential if you do it in one big test or you do it in two tests.  But I would say I prefer the staff’s approach of doing it in two phases. There was one item, though, in the Tarullo–Powell memo that I don’t agree with, which was the idea of not ruling out moving the program up or down in size from the $300 billion mark.  The reason why I think that you actually do want to move the program size up and down symmetrically around $300 billion is you really don’t know whether the amount of headroom—in other words, the difference between the bids and the cap—actually matters in terms of how people bid.  You don’t know whether the amount of headroom that they perceive is going to affect the size of the bids, or whether the floor is more solid with more headroom or less headroom.  I think that, by moving the size of a facility up and down, you are going to actually affect the amount of headroom up and down, and you are going to see whether headroom actually affects the behavior of people who are bidding in the auctions. I also think that moving the size of the facility up or down has some benefit of underscoring that, while size is important to us, we want the facility to be as small as possible, subject to monetary policy control, but size is not the primary objective.  The primary objective   is monetary policy control.  If you think monetary control is the most important issue, then I think you don’t want people to be overinvested in $300 billion.  If people really thought that $300 billion was it, and that was what we were going to do no matter what, the program might not work very well.  It would also contaminate the findings of the test.  Let’s imagine that, in fact, we were willing to vary the size ultimately, if it turned out we didn’t have sufficient monetary control, but the market thought that the size was fixed at $300 billion.  Then the test would actually be contaminated by a false set of expectations. I would much prefer when we move to that second stage at the end of October that we vary the size of the program up or down around $300 billion symmetrically, because I think we will get some information from that, and I think we will also make it clear to people that monetary policy control is really our first objective and the size is slightly less important than that.  I don’t think they are going to raise their expectations of size necessarily because we are varying the size, but I just think it means that size is not immutable as we take this program forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker provides their opinion and preferences but does not directly challenge or contradict any other views.


Passage number 71.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Just one point on that, Vice Chairman Dudley.  Assuming that we go forward with the planned test for this intermeeting period, we’ll see what happens when you put in the $300 billion overall limit.  As I think Lorie said in her briefing, it will be interesting to see if that affects the efficacy of the overnight RRP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply mentions that they will test the impact of a $300 billion overall limit on the efficacy of the overnight RRP. There is no explicit contention or disagreement.


Passage number 72.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It will be interesting to see what it does to people’s expectations of how big the facility is going to be over time.  I would imagine that number is going to come down, too, as a consequence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely expressing curiosity about the potential impact on people's expectations of the facility's size over time.


Passage number 73.
 MR. ENGLISH.  The other thing is, if we go ahead with the test of the circuit-breaker cap after the October meeting, it will presumably come in below the $300 billion.  It will give us a   test, at least in the downward direction, of whether further reduction in headroom would matter for the efficacy of the program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a perspective or point of view without any conflicting opinions.


Passage number 74.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, although the one-day circuit-breaker cap is sort of a different thing in terms of how you think about the facility.  You might not be able to get in the facility for one day, but then the cap lessens again.  I think it is a little different than knowing that there is a firm cap that exists over the long run.  I think they are slightly “apples and oranges,” in my opinion. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and stating that they see a distinction between the one-day circuit-breaker cap and a firm cap over the long run.


Passage number 75.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Could I first ask the Vice Chairman why he says that Governor Powell and I were opposed to the two-phase approach.  I thought we were pretty clear in the memo that we were fine with going forward with this, and we just thought it was useful to have a conversation now about the broader approach that we would take.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is agreement in the passage. The speaker states that they were fine with going forward with the two-phase approach and just wanted to have a conversation about the broader approach.


Passage number 76.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, number one, Governor Tarullo, is that it says, “Commitment to full program of testing, with results to be reviewed at the December FOMC meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a point about a commitment to testing with results to be reviewed at a specific meeting.


Passage number 77.
” MR. TARULLO.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply includes a statement by Mr. Tarullo without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 78.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That seems different from doing a stage of testing, finishing up, coming back in October, and then doing a second phase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply describing a different sequence of events or actions. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 79.
 MR. TARULLO  “We have no objection to undertaking this phase through a discrete resolution at this meeting.”  I thought that was about as explicit as we could get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo explicitly states that they have no objection to undertaking this phase through a discrete resolution at this meeting, indicating agreement and support.


Passage number 80.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, I read number one, “with results to be reviewed at the December FOMC meeting,” as implying one longer phase rather than two phases.  Maybe I misinterpreted the memo.  But, as I said, I don’t think the issue of one phase versus two phases is   that significant.  I think it is really a question of, what is the best way to roll this out to market participants so they can digest it and understand what is happening.  I don’t feel that strongly about that.  I do feel more strongly about the idea that size is off limits in terms of a parameter value that we can vary. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their interpretation and opinion on different aspects of the topic being discussed.


Passage number 81.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This has been a really helpful conversation.  I think it is going to flow into questions that I imagine will emerge shortly after the release of our normalization principles.  I think the Vice Chairman said it well, that the focus of the intended use of this facility, if it indeed gets used, is monetary policy control.  I think people are going to be seeking information about exactly what those three words mean.  Is what we mean by that 25 basis points.  Is it as large as 50.  And I think that will be a very important guidepost as we move forward.  I think this is very clear in the principles.  We want it to be as small as possible in order to achieve monetary policy control.  Then, importantly, market participants are going to be seeking guidance about what we mean by that.  I think that the normalization principles should offer protection against some of the adverse signaling effects of various testing protocols that Governors Tarullo and Powell referenced in their memo.  But I think the principles, as written, are very strong about what the intentions are in terms of the use of the facility.  It is to achieve monetary policy control, and the duration and size of it are going to be dictated by that. I am sure, Madam Chair, when you speak on Wednesday, you will be talking about that when you talk about what we are saying in the principles.  I think that message would be further enhanced if it was underscored in future speeches by the Vice Chairman, by the managers of the markets group.  This is a way to underscore that the principles really are going to be guiding our   thinking about this, and it is about monetary policy control, as the Vice Chairman said.  But I do think people are going to want to have more clarity about those three words very shortly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 82.
 MR. FISCHER.  Which three words.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the following passage as it consists only of a person's name and a question, without any conflicting opinions or statements.


Passage number 83.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Monetary policy control.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement of fact.


Passage number 84.
 MR. FISCHER.  MPC.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is stating a name or title followed by an acronym.


Passage number 85.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  MPC, yes.  CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that Mr. Kocherlakota is part of the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) and that President Fisher is also involved in the discussion.


Passage number 86.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, Madam Chair, Narayana summarized what I think is the main issue here.  It’s the final sentence in the normalization principles, and you don’t even use the term “monetary policy control.”  We just say we are going to use it to the extent necessary, and we will phase it out when it is no longer needed.  I do think Governor Tarullo and Governor Powell have some very good points in their memo.  I think the purpose of the exercise, though, is, first, we have to understand how we use this little muscle.  And then we are making it clear that in testing it and putting it out there, we obviously do so in a way that doesn’t belie this last sentence.  I do think it’s very important that you stress this in your press conference.  I know you will. CHAIR YELLEN.  I plan to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with Governor Tarullo and Governor Powell, and is emphasizing the importance of communicating certain points in a press conference.


Passage number 87.
 MR. FISHER.  No further comment, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher states that he has no further comment, and Chair Yellen acknowledges this by saying "President Mester." There is no clear indication of disagreement or opposition between the two.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 88.
 MS. MESTER.  I guess I thought when I read Governor Tarullo and Powell’s memo that they were suggesting announcing at this meeting that we had a plan to test other aspects, not necessarily doing it or being against doing it in two phases.  But we would tell the public that we   are going to be testing this operation in different phases and laying it all out there.  I don’t think that would be that confusing, but maybe you would know better. But I do have a question about the size limit, the $300 billion.  As I read the memo, it seemed to suggest that you think that will bind at the end of the third quarter, which is why you chose that level.  But it only bound once, one day at the end of the second quarter.  You also have in the memo that on 95 percent of the days since the January FOMC meeting, the take-up was $55 billion to $210 billion.  My question is, why wouldn’t you want to lower that limit so that you are assured that it will bind, so that you can actually test the auction.  Because if it doesn’t bind at the end of the third quarter, you miss an opportunity of the test.  I guess size matters here, maybe, for this test.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Mester, is suggesting that the size limit should be lowered in order to ensure that it will bind and allow for the testing of the auction. This suggests a disagreement with the current approach outlined in the memo.


Passage number 89.
 MS. LOGAN.  I think one thing we’re testing is whether the change in the perceived headroom will affect the market participants’ behavior.  Even if the auction process isn’t binding, we will see whether this more limited program changes their behavior, their willingness to leave other counterparties for the overnight RRP facility.  I think it does help us to test that aspect of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and suggesting that testing the impact of the change in perceived headroom on market participants' behavior would be beneficial.


Passage number 90.
 MS. MESTER.  Why wouldn’t you want to have a lower one, so you could actually have the auction work and see how that works.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking a question and seeking clarification or justification for the preference of having a lower auction.


Passage number 91.
 MS. LOGAN.  I think we were interested in two different aspects.  One is potentially the operational aspects of an auction, which we have tested before in other elements, and the second is the concept of headroom, and does lower headroom and less certainty about the headroom—right now, they have full certainty of the $10 billion amount at the end of the day, and now there is just less certainty about what they have available at the end of the day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, there is no clear contention or disagreement. Ms. Logan is simply stating that they were interested in two different aspects of the topic: the operational aspects of an auction and the concept of headroom. She is not contradicting or challenging anyone else's statements or ideas.


Passage number 92.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You also have year-end, and I’m sure year-end will be binding, no matter what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presented as a fact, suggesting that year-end will be binding regardless of any other circumstances.


Passage number 93.
   MS. MESTER.  Yes.  But I thought the idea was that we would try to do it and learn something over this first phase of the test.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses an understanding of the idea and suggests attempting it to gain knowledge during the initial phase of the test.


Passage number 94.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Well, I think Lorie has it about right.  I think we are moving a little slowly, but imposing a $300 billion limit will provide us information about the extent to which headroom matters for the efficacy of this program.  As she suggested, we could subsequently test either a dynamic circuit-breaker cap or just adjust the overall limit up and down.  That would generate more days when there would be a binding cap and more days when the auction would be in play. I guess I am hesitant to push too quickly to a very low number that would bind relatively often, just because I’m not sure we would getting a good read on at least what I have in mind for how this would work when we’re actually doing this after normalization, which would be to have a limit that doesn’t bind a whole lot, but binds only rarely.  I want to try to see what that looks like, if we can, in the month of October and then come back. On your issue of getting out to the public more information about subsequent testing after the October meeting, this discussion will be described in the minutes.  We will provide some information on what sorts of testing might be done in October and some of the views around those sorts of tests.  That information will get out in three weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 95.
  MS. MESTER.  You don’t want to put in the announcement just that other testing will be done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no disagreement or contention in the given passage. The statement provided by Ms. Mester is straightforward and does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 96.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I guess I don’t see a need to.  We are going to be providing a lot of information tomorrow.  I would like this piece of information to be relatively simple, so it will be understood well.  The normalization principles will come out, there is a press conference, there is   a statement.  This is something we thought a fair amount about, and thought that the way we’d prefer it at this stage was something that was relatively simple and easily understood. CHAIR YELLEN.  Two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 97.
 MR. FISCHER.  Two-hander, yes.  What is the point of the current discussion.  Is it about whether we are going to declare a $300 billion number and review it at the next meeting.  Or is it, are we going to go into one long program.  I’m not quite sure what we are discussing at the moment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply explaining confusion about what the current discussion is about. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 98.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, there are two separate issues.  There is one issue about how much information you want to announce in your testing program.  Do you want to announce a whole bunch of parameters that are going to change or just a subset of the parameters that are going to change in the initial phase of the test.  As I said, you could do it either way, but I am supportive of what Bill said, in the sense that I think it is easier; the market is going to have a lot of information to digest on Wednesday.  I would prefer to give it to them in stages, but you could give them more information than that. The second issue is, do you want to commit today that we’re not going to change the size of the program in the testing process.  I think that is not a good idea.  We should be willing to change the size of the test, because changing the size of the headroom will give us some information about how this program operates.  I would personally like that information.  Those are the two issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents two separate issues for consideration.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 99.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Well, and more broadly on the second issue, what are the tests that people around this table think would be most useful to do after October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in this passage. This can be inferred from the phrase "what are the tests that people around this table think would be most useful to do," which implies that there are differing opinions among the participants.


Passage number 100.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Presumably, we will have more information then to make a better judgment on that.   CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing a prediction that in the future they will have more information to make a better judgment. There is no opposing view or contradictory statement presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 101.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I generally trust the staff when it brings me recommendations about how we should proceed about things, but I find myself a bit skeptical about the need for a flurry of further testing activity here.  I am really confident in the computer code and the technical infrastructure.  Over the past 12 months, the Markets Group has demonstrated great skill and competence and capability of running a facility of this size that is envisioned by the Committee.  I don’t see the auction facility as posing any—and you alluded to this, Lorie—novel challenges.  You have done auctions before.  You have been doing them for decades in the RP market. On changing the amount of the cap to see whether the headroom matters, I think the use of this as a tool is sort of predicated on us setting the size so the headroom generally doesn’t matter.  How would headroom matter.  They’d have to look at the data and figure, all right, usage on a day like today is typically $200 billion.  There is $300 billion headroom.  What are the odds of it stopping out.  How badly do I want it.  Should I put in a bid at four instead of five.  That’s what we are going to find out, right.  Now, I don’t think we are going to run it if when we run it people are putting in four or three rather than five, because it just weakens the effect.  If it’s binding, it is just going to mean a lower RRP rate.  My sense is that if it is binding and the headroom matters, we are going to increase the cap so that it doesn’t matter.  This is consistent with Bill’s description of the philosophy about the cap.  Now, sure, it is going to bind on quarter-end.  Absolutely.  But people are going to look at quarter-ends and they are going to say, “Well, it is going to bind today.  I’d better bid two if I really want to put the money there.” I don’t think varying the RP rate is going to generate a lot of useful data.  Given the magnitude of fluctuations of other things that affect the demand for the usage of this facility,   essentially, I’m not convinced we are going to have much statistical power to estimate some demand curve.  I mean, we are only doing this for a set of days over the rest of the year.  And I think the downside is something that Governors Tarullo and Powell were articulate about.  I think we, arguably, generated expectations of the market running ahead of our expectations, clearly over the summer, to the point at which we heard information about people building business models around it.  I think we are likely to do that again with another burst of testing activity.  I’m just really skeptical about the need for this.  Maybe you can help me understand the precise information that is going to be revealed here and how useful it is going to be for our use of the facility as we go forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses skepticism about the need for further testing activity and questions the usefulness of varying the RP rate to generate useful data. They also express concern about generating market expectations and note that other Governors have previously articulated concerns about this.


Passage number 102.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Can I try, and then Simon or Lorie will add.  On the auction issue, I agree.  I think the machinery will run, but, nonetheless, I think it’s useful to have the staff as well as the counterparties actually do an auction that matters.  This is a slightly unusual auction mechanism that we’re setting up.  People haven’t thought about it much, I think, because at the moment they write down just a 5 basis point rate.  It may well be that it’s absolutely fine.  I’d like to see that and see people try that out. On the headroom issue, you may well be right that if there is insufficient headroom and the efficacy of the program is impaired, the Committee will want to increase the size of the program to provide the additional headroom.  What I’ve heard around the table is some discomfort with increasing the size of the program, but I would be interested to know how much headroom we actually need to make this thing operate properly.  That’s why I am interested in trying a test with $300 billion and maybe later on with a dynamic circuit-breaker cap or with a lower number—to see how much headroom we need for this thing to work properly.  I’m not sure we know that right now.   Finally, in terms of the public reaction, by announcing these tests now would we lead people to think that this is going to be a larger, more durable program, which I think is the Committee’s concern.  I really don’t think so.  I think announcing the $300 billion cap and the $5 billion rate and then subsequently coming back and maybe introducing a circuit-breaker cap is going to make clear to the public, along with the normalization principles, that the Committee really does intend for this thing to be small and temporary, and that the Committee’s concerns about possible financial-stability risks are real and are leading them to take steps to try to limit those risks.  Maybe I’m just being a very risk-averse staff person, but there you have it.  That’s what I am.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with certain points and curiosity about others.


Passage number 103.
  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  And we’re glad you are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a simple statement expressing happiness.


Passage number 104.
 MR. ENGLISH.  But I like the idea of doing something like these tests.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English expresses his positive sentiment towards the idea of doing tests.


Passage number 105.
 MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up on the “headroom” question.  If you came to us and said, “Let’s permanently implement a $300 billion cap,” I’d say, “Great.”  This stuff about the fluctuations in the RRP rate and the headroom issue, we’re not going to get much—I mean, how well are we going to be able to extrapolate to a situation in which we’re pretty far away from the zero bound.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the idea of implementing a $300 billion cap and acknowledging the limitations of extrapolating from the current situation.


Passage number 106.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Well, I agree.  We’re going to learn more over time, and life is complicated, but I think we will learn by doing this test and perhaps, depending on what the Committee wants to do, additional testing after October.  We’ll learn whether having a limit, and a limit that is potentially not that far from where usage is, affects how the competition plays out in these markets and how people are judging their confidence in their ability to place money with us, and how that passes through to market rates.  I don’t know how that works out.  My sense is that having a $300 billion cap now when average usage is around $150 billion will be essentially   irrelevant.  I think that’s what you were saying earlier, and it should not affect the efficacy of the program, but I guess I’d like to see that.  I’d like to be sure that’s right, and potentially later on, by using either a circuit-breaker cap or varying the overall limit, get a better sense for how much headroom we need for this thing to work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage expresses agreement and a desire for further testing and clarification.


Passage number 107.
 MS. LOGAN.  We are getting some useful data, and we will be getting more useful data from the triparty banks about the individual transactions.  And so we can see that the counterparties are willing to take lower rates than the overnight RRP facility even when they’re not hitting the cap for a portion of their trading activity because—what we hear from them as anecdotal evidence—they don’t want to lose access to dealer balance sheets.  They’re willing to accept a lower rate to maintain those relationships.  I think we will be able to see if they’re willing to accept even more at that lower rate, because the idea that the cap is going to limit the total size makes them even more reluctant to leave dealer balance sheets.  I recognize that money market rate fluctuations are very difficult to disentangle, but I do think we will be able to learn a little bit on the margin about their change in behavior from the more limited program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their observations and beliefs about the behavior of the counterparties in relation to the overnight RRP facility.


Passage number 108.
 MR. POTTER.  Another thing is, the notional limit right now is $1.4 trillion.  The effect of it is about $1 trillion because of the $10 billion per counterparty.  This could be spun as a substantial change in the headroom if people wanted to do it that way, which is, I think, what the Committee wanted to do with the $300 billion limit.  Bill was trying to say the same thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the notional limit and its effects.


Passage number 109.
 MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up. CHAIR YELLEN.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is asking to follow up on something, and Chair Yellen gives him permission to do so.


Passage number 110.
 MR. LACKER.  I wonder, given the discussion, whether we ought to be thinking about the transition path after that.  Do we keep $300 billion as the cap and sail into 2015 with that cap   there, or are we going to lift it—maybe this is in the memo—at the end of the experiment, the testing phase, or how are we going to handle that transition at the end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing a potential transition path after a certain period of time, but there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement among the speakers.


Passage number 111.
 MR. ENGLISH.  As Governor Powell said last time, I think we’ll learn some from the testing and from additional experience with the program, and when the time comes to actually normalize, the Committee will have some decisions to make about what the parameters are that it wants to set at that time.  I don’t want to write those down now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. English is simply stating his agreement with Governor Powell's statement and indicating that the Committee will need to make decisions in the future, without specifying what those decisions might be.


Passage number 112.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Bill, wasn’t the idea, though, that we’re going to try to test the program under parameters that were similar to where we thought we might ultimately land to get the best quality information we could, recognizing that we might find things that we don’t want to find that could affect what those parameter values are.  But, my presumption is that the $300 billion is somehow our initial guess of where we might want to end up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 113.
 MR. POTTER.  We need to explain it that way.  Otherwise it looks quite strange. CHAIR YELLEN.  I had a two-hander from Governor Tarullo some time ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Potter, suggests a certain explanation, and Chair Yellen acknowledges receiving a message from Governor Tarullo. There is no conflict or disagreement expressed between the speakers.


Passage number 114.
 MR. TARULLO.  Oh, no, I’m a one-hander. CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, okay.  Sorry about that.  President Kocherlakota, did you have a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not showcase any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 115.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I did.  I was going to follow up on President Lacker’s intervention.  I find that the staff are in the best position to understand the benefits of further testing.  They are much closer to the problem than I am.  But I want to speak on the issue, the downside risk that President Lacker pointed to, which is the signaling effect.  I think we’re going to be in a much different position with respect to that once we release the normalization principles than we were before we released the normalization principles.  I think the Committee will have made a very clear and concrete statement about what we intend this facility to be used   for.  As I indicated in my earlier remarks, that can be bolstered, I think, through speeches from the Vice Chairman and from the director of the Markets Group and from the Chair and from you, President Lacker, as well.  I mean, we can all have the opportunity to speak to what this facility means.  We didn’t have that opportunity before when we hadn’t expressed a collective view on that.  I think the statement is going to really help protect us against the downside risks that you pointed to.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, is agreeing with President Lacker's point about the downside risk but also adding his own perspective on how releasing the normalization principles can help clarify the purpose of the facility and mitigate the risks. There is a sense of collaboration and agreement in the passage.


Passage number 116.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As should be apparent from the memo that Jay and I sent around, we actually are for testing and think it’s important for a lot of the reasons that Bill English explained. I’m going to just speak for myself now—Governor Powell can speak for himself.  My concern about the staff memo is similar to the concerns I had about some of the stuff that circulated earlier, and I think it was underscored a bit by the way in which Vice Chairman Dudley explained his position, which is—getting back to Narayana’s observation—monetary policy control is the aim, and then, once that is achieved, we can look at financial-stability considerations.  I would say my concern is it has to be a bit more balanced along the way.  That is, if monetary policy control, getting to a precise point or closer to a precise point, comes only at the cost of substantial financial-stability concerns or a substantial alteration of the financial services industry, then I think the tradeoff is somewhat different, and that’s the way I’ve looked at it from the outset. To a considerable extent, I think what a lot of us wanted to do in the past few meetings was push back in the box some of these expectations that had arisen in markets as to the scope and potential duration of this thing.  I think President Kocherlakota has hit the nail on the head in   trying to elicit from us collectively a little bit more of a sense of what our calculus is in the relationship between monetary policy control and what that means and potential implications for financial stability and for the impact on the financial services industry. With respect to what’s before us today, as Governor Powell and I said in the memo, we’re fine with going ahead in this first phase.  We have accomplished some of what I hoped to, which is to get some of these broader issues out in front of us, but I would end by saying that I think between now and October, there’s an opportunity for the staff and others to reformulate a bit how the additional testing and the overall program of testing can be both characterized and executed so as to continue to push back against the sense that as long as there’s enough demand or as long as it might possibly be necessary, we’re going to go down that road and increase the size of the facility.  The single line in the staff memo that drew my attention the most was in the proposal to increase the overall size limit, which was justified in part on the grounds that that would signal to the public that we would increase the ultimate size limit.  I think we’re just going to have to be very conscious of maintaining a form of ambiguity here so that we can do the testing that most of us, at least, think is warranted without allowing expectations to get away from us a bit. For today, Madam Chair, I, at least, am fine with ratifying the resolution that has been put in front of us.  I think there’s been a useful identification of some issues, and I don’t see any need to try to wrap any of this up until October, although that is going to be a pretty full meeting. CHAIR YELLEN.  We will have a lot to do in October.  Are there any further comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 117.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Can I just follow up on what Governor Tarullo just said.  I completely agree, and we’ve tried, I think, in the memos but evidently failed to be clear:  In the end, the   Committee is going to have a tradeoff, a balancing act, between, on the one hand, getting better or worse control over rates, which has some benefits and costs, and, on the other hand, having a program that’s bigger or smaller and, therefore, has bigger or smaller risks and costs associated with footprint and with financial-stability risks.  I think that’s exactly where we’re going to end up—thinking about what the parameters we are going to want to write down ultimately when we are ready to actually try to normalize.  I completely agree with the thought that this isn’t, in some sense, how much do we need to have control and leave the other stuff aside.  It’s going to be a balancing act. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Further comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. English, mentions that he completely agrees with what Governor Tarullo said. However, he states that they have failed to be clear in their memos. This suggests that there may be some disagreement or potential conflict in their communication and understanding of the issue at hand.


Passage number 118.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I agree with that.  Really, the reason why I reacted to keeping the size fixed is that seemed to say that there wasn’t a balancing act, that the size was somehow independent of full monetary control, and I think the balance is exactly what we’re trying to see.  That’s why the Committee is committed to trying to keep the facility as small as possible, because I think we recognize that there are financial-stability issues. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing agreement with a previous statement and further explaining their reasoning.


Passage number 119.
 MR. POWELL.  Let me just add two things.  One, I do take personally and very seriously the idea that we need to have monetary control, and by that I have a fairly old-school understanding of what that is, which is, I want the federal funds rate to be in the band, predictably so, and if it gets out over the quarter-end, that’s okay for a day or so.  That’s not a big deal.  But I do see that as critical, and I think if we do that at the beginning, our work is going to be a lot easier later on.  If we don’t do it at the beginning, it’s going to make what’s already going to be a challenging process more difficult.   The second thing is, it comes down to the issue of, do you test the size.  I certainly personally think—and our memo says—that if a facility needs to be somewhat larger to have monetary policy control, then I would put that on the table with all the other tools and absolutely use it.  The question I’ve been struggling with is, if you’re willing to do that in real time, is that not a sufficient answer.  Do you still need to test now.  Vice Chairman Dudley’s given us a couple of reasons why that might be the case and said things I hadn’t really thought about, so I would like the opportunity to consider that further. CHAIR YELLEN.  Very good.  Okay.  We need to vote on the resolution that is in front of all of you.  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 120.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed.  [No response]  Okay, great.  The motion passes, and we will return in October.  We now also need to vote to ratify open market operations since the July meeting.  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a straightforward exchange of motions and a vote without any opposing responses.


Passage number 121.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Without objection.  Okay, great.  Our next topic is monetary policy normalization principles, and let me just make a couple of opening comments if I might, and then we’ll go to discussion.3 First of all, I want to again express my appreciation to all of you for the productive discussions we have had over the past several meetings and for your thoughtful and constructive comments on the various drafts.  I think we all know the effectiveness of this Committee depends on a spirit of cooperation and a willingness to compromise, and I’m pleased that these  3 The materials used by Chair Yellen are appended to this transcript (appendix 3).   traits have characterized our deliberations on the many complex issues related to policy normalization. I think we’ve settled on a set of normalization principles and plans that can be released tomorrow with widespread support from Committee participants.  I recognize that, as individuals, we may still differ on some particular elements, but I consider it important for us as a Committee to confidently and clearly articulate our normalization plans at this time.  To get a clear sense of your support, what I plan to do is to ask for a show of hands for all participants on the version of the normalization principles and plans that you have before you.  But before I do that, I want to say just a few words about how I intend to communicate about our approach to normalization both in tomorrow’s press conference and in other venues. First, I intend to emphasize that the release of our normalization principles and plans is in no way intended to signal a change in the stance of monetary policy, a point the Committee has repeatedly emphasized. Second, I think it’s important to convey a willingness on the part of the Committee to be flexible and pragmatic in its approach to normalization in a manner that is consistent with the principles.  As written, the principles afford us a good deal of latitude to change the parameters of our tools to achieve our desired stance of policy in a wide range of scenarios.  I don’t intend to get into technical details, such as the exact configuration of our administered rates or the specific design features of the overnight RRP facility, some of which, as we’ve discussed, may evolve over time or have yet to be determined.  Of course, we will communicate these details to the public at the appropriate time.  Additionally, I would like to emphasize that the final bullet of our principles is not merely boilerplate.  I believe we should convey a readiness to change our approach if economic and financial conditions evolve in unforeseen ways, and, in fact, I think the   revisions we’re making to our normalization principles that change what we issued in 2011 is evidence of just that. Finally, I intend to convey our high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver the stance of policy that we deem appropriate to promote our dual mandate. I will ask for a show of hands, but before I do so, I would like to ask if anyone has comments or questions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 122.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a couple of words I’d like to share.  I know I spoke at length at the previous meeting, but the statement has been revised and there have been a couple of further observations I would like to share.  I will try not to be repetitive. I do support the idea of publishing an updated set of principles regarding our normalization, but I can’t support this version.  I continue to believe it would be a mistake to retreat from asset sales.  The statement goes further than just disavowing asset sales, though.  It singles out, somewhat oddly, agency MBS as an asset class that we don’t anticipate selling.  It does so, almost in passing, without explanation in a subbullet.  I know we haven’t provided any rationale for this change from our 2011 exit strategy principles in public, including in the minutes of the previous meeting.  Doing so, singling out agency MBS to hold on to, makes more glaring the conflict with the statement that immediately follows that in the principles about our interest in minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.  As I noted in August, I don’t see how to reconcile holding on to Fannie and Freddie securities with that or with the March 23, 2009, Treasury–Federal Reserve joint statement or with our historical opposition to this type of central bank credit allocation.  I also mentioned at our previous meeting that if our holdings of agency MBS are having any effect on interest rates, they are simultaneously raising the interest rates for borrowers outside the   mortgage markets when compared with us holding an identical amount of Treasuries.  I haven’t heard and I don’t see a case for that kind of favoritism. I have two points to make that I haven’t made before.  One is that I recognize the normal conduct of monetary policy via movements in interest rates unavoidably generates distributional effects.  I recognize that central bankers long ago accustomed themselves to those necessary side effects.  Such policy actions, however, worked by adding or draining reserves—a liability of ours—and they can be accomplished quite well with a portfolio consisting only of Treasury securities.  Holding assets other than Treasuries goes beyond what is required for the normal conduct of policy, so I see a fairly sharp categorical distinction between the unavoidable distributional consequences of the normal conduct of policy via interest rate movements and the distributional effects of gratuitously altering the composition of our portfolio. The second point—one factor that appears to loom large in thinking about whether to sell long-term assets is that it is likely to generate losses large enough to wipe out the possibility of remittances to the Treasury at a time when we will be paying large dollar amounts to banks as interest on reserves.  Even though this is of no economic consequence, one can imagine it generating a good deal of carping by public commentators and politicians. I’d point out that if we don’t sell assets, we will generate substantial unrealized losses in a couple of years.  Page 45 of Book B of the Tealbook reports the staff’s projections of our balance sheet and income.  At the end of last year, unrealized losses were $53 billion, just shy of our paid-in capital and surplus of $55 billion.  This did actually spawn a bit of media commentary, even though we still showed positive fair-value net worth of just under $2 billion.  The Tealbook is projecting that unrealized losses will peak at $325 billion at the end of 2016, and our capital then is likely to be around $75 billion.  At that point, it will look as if our fair-  value net worth is about negative $250 billion, and it would be pretty easy, I think, for someone to write a story portraying the Federal Reserve as effectively bankrupt.  Unrealized losses are projected to be close to $300 billion at the end of 2015, and so it is likely to get a lot of attention when these financial statements are released in early 2016.  It is a year and a half away when we are going to face this.  At that point, we are going to have to explain why it is of no consequence that we have effectively gone bankrupt while paying out large sums of money to large banks.  This strikes me as just as difficult as explaining why zero remittances are of no economic consequence.  It is not obvious to me that we would be in much better shape avoiding asset sales in order to continue making remittances to the Treasury.  The point is, we have signed up for some very adverse “optics,” no matter which way we go.  Zero remittances may be hard to explain, but negative fair-value net worth seems just as hard to explain.  To me, this argues for doing what we agreed is the right thing to do and selling long-term assets as we originally planned.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker does not support the revised version of the statement and believes that it would be a mistake to retreat from asset sales. He also questions the rationale for holding on to agency MBS and argues that it conflicts with the goal of minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit. Additionally, Mr. Lacker raises concerns about the potential losses generated from selling long-term assets and the impact on remittances to the Treasury. He argues that it may be difficult to explain the negative fair-value net worth that would result from not selling assets.


Passage number 123.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just want to say that I very much support the principles as written.  I think they are clear and sensible.  I want to thank the Chair in particular for doing this in the iterative process that she set out on, so that she got a tremendous amount of feedback from everyone on the Committee.  I know everyone probably isn’t fully accommodated, and probably people, if they had to write their principles, would write them slightly differently.  But I think that by doing it the way you did it, Madam Chair, I think you have gotten something that the broad Committee can support.  I think you acted in very good faith. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses support for the principles and appreciates the iterative process followed by the Chair to gather feedback from the Committee. Although the speaker mentions that not everyone may be fully accommodated and different individuals might have written the principles differently, they still believe that the final result is something that the broad Committee can support. The speaker also praises the Chair for her good faith in the process.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 124.
   MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.  First of all, I would like to echo Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments about the process and listening to everybody.  I think you were very positive in expressing in a memo some of the concerns that I had and listened to the response, and I appreciate that very much.  I also appreciate the fact that it led to some changes that were adopted in the statement. However, I would just like to say, for the record, that I remain uncomfortable with the subbullet that refers to sales of agency and mortgage-backed securities and linking those to reducing residual holdings.  The second main bullet makes clear our intention to reduce the balance sheet primarily through ending repurchases.  I just don’t believe we need to communicate additional reticence over the outright sale of agency debt securities and mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process.  While no outright sales may be feasible, given the significant uncertainty surrounding normalization—uncertainty, by the way, that was made abundantly clear in the background memos we received from the staff—it seems to me imprudent and unnecessary to signal such decisions at this point.  It may transpire that adequate control of the funds rate may require us to shrink the balance sheet faster than we now anticipate.  If that were to happen, I would want all potential tools available to proceed under those circumstances.  Further, I remain uncomfortable, as President Lacker so eloquently put it, with the credit allocation policy that this bullet signals. These broad concerns about the balance sheet also lead me to prefer ending reinvestment earlier.  President Lacker just made a very good point, indicating that there are a number of changes we have made from the 2011 principles, and we have done so without much, if any, thorough explanation to the public about why they are being changed.  This suggests we should be reluctant, I think, to insert such tactical considerations in our statement.   Now, the escape clause that the Chair referred to at the end in the final bullet does leave us with our options open.  I will not withhold my assent to these principles as written.  But I continue to believe that we are once again being overly tactical in our messaging on this issue.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser expresses his discomfort and disagreement with the subbullet that refers to sales of agency and mortgage-backed securities and linking those to reducing residual holdings. He also disagrees with the credit allocation policy that this bullet signals. He believes that it is imprudent and unnecessary to signal decisions about outright sales at this point and prefers ending reinvestment earlier.


Passage number 125.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I am generally supportive of these normalization principles.  As you all know, I have advocated keeping the feature from the 2011 principles that the first step in normalization should be to end reinvestment.  The version we are ratifying today does not have that feature.  My understanding is that the Committee intends to end reinvestment in a reasonable time-frame after liftoff of the policy rate.  I think that will be an important step to get the balance sheet moving in the right direction.  With that understanding, I am happy to support the current normalization principles.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard expresses his support for the normalization principles and mentions his preference for including the feature of ending reinvestment in the principles. However, he also states that he is happy to support the current principles with the understanding that reinvestment will end in a reasonable time-frame after the policy rate liftoff. There is no disagreement or contention expressed.


Passage number 126.
  MR. FISHER.  Well, you thanked us for our thoughtful input, Madam Chair.  I want to thank you, as well as Vice Chairman Dudley, for your thoughtful and receptive ear, because changes were made.  Obviously, as Vice Chairman Dudley said, not everybody got what they wanted.  I have been advocating, banging my head against the table, to start the process of tapering reinvestments.  I am delighted with your comment emphasizing the very last bullet.  I think that is important. I take note of the fact that, as President Lacker said, there are unrealized losses.  If we were to sell these securities, we would realize those losses, and I am sympathetic to that.  I do support this, and I want to emphasize what Vice Chairman Dudley said.  The way you went about this is a great example of leadership, and I thank you for it.   CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses gratitude and support for the actions and decisions made by the Chair and Vice Chairman.


Passage number 127.
 MR. FISHER.  Emphasize that last point, though, in your press conference. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Fisher is simply urging Chair Yellen to highlight a specific point in her press conference.


Passage number 128.
   MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Steve, I’d like to ask if you could expand and speculate on your “big bazooka” comment about the ECB asset purchases.  Could you provide any type of commentary on the uncertainty about the size of that.  I might have hoped that there would be more firmness in the expectation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a request for further clarification or information.


Passage number 129.
 MR. KAMIN.  First, as Simon mentioned earlier, the ECB would certainly face a host of operational issues in terms of buying, say, €1 trillion, which works out to about 10 percent of euro-area GDP, in sovereign bonds, given that every country issues in different ways, in different markets, and with different degrees of liquidity.  So while there are a number of operational issues, I don’t think that they represent the main obstacle to the ECB doing that.  The main obstacle is the fact that they are enjoined specifically not to finance government deficits, and at least some countries, particularly Germany, would view that activity as indeed violating that doctrine.  So that’s clearly something that they want to use as a very last resort.  I would guess that some members of the Governing Council are already there, and they’re waiting for other people to catch up.  They’re also waiting to determine whether the outlook actually ends up being significantly worse than right now. Our sense right now is that, if the economy and inflation proceed according to our baseline, which has gradual, albeit lackluster, improvement in economic growth and gradual, albeit subdued, recovery of the 12-month inflation rate that they look at—if those things all transpire, then they will basically be willing to call it quits in the sense of just implementing the measures they’ve already taken.  In that case, they’re probably not going to get the political support to move further.  Conversely, if there’s a further shock or a further shortfall, with the growth rate staying around zero and maybe inflation moving even lower, then, at that point, there will be quite a few folks on the Governing Council of the ECB who will be pushing for this.And if things got bad enough, they would lose the German vote and perhaps several other Northern European votes, and they would actually go ahead and start the process of larger-scale asset purchases.  Maybe Simon has something to add.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It discusses the operational issues and obstacles the ECB would face in purchasing sovereign bonds and mentions differing views on whether this violates the doctrine of not financing government deficits. It also discusses the conditions under which members of the Governing Council may push for larger-scale asset purchases. However, there is no direct disagreement or contention between the speakers in the passage.


Passage number 130.
 MR. POTTER.  There was a poll before the ECB meeting showing a 40 percent probability of sovereign debt purchases by March of next year; that has probably gone up.  They can easily buy sovereign debt relative to the private assets.  That’s one of the attractive things for them.  But trying to get agreement across the Governing Council will be quite difficult, although they have had two asset purchase programs.  One was this Securities Markets Programme to stabilize rates.  And they had the most successful program without ever purchasing anything, called the Outright Monetary Transactions program, which is also in sovereign debt.  But this would be different in the sense that you’d probably be buying across the capital markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of facts and does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 131.
 MR. EVANS.  What’s the size of the OMT program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward question asking for information.


Passage number 132.
 MR. POTTER.  Zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the name "Mr. Potter" and the number "Zero," without indicating any conflict or differing viewpoints.


Passage number 133.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 134.
 MR. POTTER.  But it’s a very effective idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is expressing his agreement with the effectiveness of the idea mentioned.


Passage number 135.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it only includes the abbreviation "MR" and does not provide any information or context for analysis.


Passage number 136.
 WILLIAMS.  Infinite elasticity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. The term "infinite elasticity" is simply stated by Williams without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas being presented.


Passage number 137.
  MR. FISHER.  May I ask a question, Madam Chair, based purely on ignorance. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is simply seeking clarification or permission to ask a question, and Chair Yellen responds affirmatively.


Passage number 138.
 MR. FISHER.  Are these jointly and severally guaranteed—the sovereign debt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 139.
 MR. POTTER.  No.  That would have helped a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that something would have helped a little bit.


Passage number 140.
 MR. FISHER.  Got it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging that they understand something.


Passage number 141.
 MR. LACKER.  No, it’s credit allocation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Lacker makes a statement about credit allocation, there is no disagreement or contention expressed.


Passage number 142.
 MR. ENGLISH.  They like it.   CHAIR YELLEN.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. English and Chair Yellen express agreement, as indicated by their statements "They like it" and "President Plosser."


Passage number 143.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  David, I have a question.  It’s a purely hypothetical question.  It’s not entirely fair, but I’m going to ask it anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that the question may not be fair but proceeds to ask it anyway.


Passage number 144.
 MR. WILCOX.  I’m quite used to the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This statement does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply states that the speaker is accustomed to being asked a certain question.


Passage number 145.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I just wanted you to understand that before I get into it further.  After the Tealbook came out, you gave us a short memo on the revisions to retail sales and how they were higher than what you anticipated and what you thought the implications of those might be.  You also mentioned in the Tealbook—and, I think, in the briefing—the observation that, over the past perhaps 10 years, the first print of the August employment numbers has, on average, been low by 60,000 jobs or something to that effect.  So the hypothetical question I’d like to ask you is that, given that this is the first print of the employment numbers, suppose the revision came in—I’ll just pick the 60,000—at 200,000.  I’m not suggesting that I believe that’s going to be the case, but let’s take that as a given.  Combining that with the higher retail sales numbers than you had in the Tealbook, I guess my question is, how might that affect the tone and shape of your forecast.  I realize that you mentioned there were other things going on—the higher value of the dollar and so forth.  Can you give me a sense of how much of an effect another 60,000 in employment would have through its effects on income and other things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply asking a hypothetical question and seeking clarification.


Passage number 146.
 MR. WILCOX.  It wouldn’t have a large effect.  Two hundred thousand for payroll employment in September would be a little disappointing relative to what we have penciled in.  For what it’s worth, we’ve got penciled in 220,000 for the next several months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and making a comparison between the expected payroll employment of 200,000 in September and the penciled in 220,000 for the next several months.


Passage number 147.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Well, I’m assuming a change to August now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states a change being assumed.


Passage number 148.
 MR. WILCOX.  Oh—yes, that’s, I think, close to what we had in mind notionally, and that’s how we got assumptions in the neighborhood of 210,000 or 220,000 over the next four   months for payroll employment—very much on the theory that probably a better number for August is something in the 175,000 to 200,000 range.  Now, I’ve got to say, this 60,000 thing is pretty darn speculative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wilcox is expressing agreement with the previous statement and adding his own speculation.


Passage number 149.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Sure, I understand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 150.
 MR. WILCOX.  There’s a “cocktail party” attractiveness to being able to say, “Well, 8 times out of the past 11, there’s been an upward revision, and those upward revisions have averaged 60,000.”  But that doesn’t pass the standard of proof that we normally apply.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply stating a fact about an "attractiveness" to being able to say something. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 151.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I prefaced my question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The mention of "my question" suggests that there could be disagreement or differing opinions between Mr. Plosser and the person he is addressing.


Passage number 152.
 MR. WILCOX.  I know, but I’m taking it seriously.  That’s not inside the normal kind of confidence interval that we would apply.  We think it’s a good possibility.  We think there’s a tendency in that direction, but we have got a lot less than definitive proof.  But I’d say that, in marking down our assumption for payroll employment gains in light of that report, we marked them down less than we would have if we’d applied zero weight to that possibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that they do not have definitive proof for their assumption but still took it into consideration when marking down their assumption.


Passage number 153.
 MR. PLOSSER.  What about—just to follow up quickly—on your labor market index, in terms of the two-month change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement that is referring to a specific question or topic asked by someone named Mr. Plosser.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 154.
 MR. WILCOX.  That’s a good question, and I don’t have an answer to what the counterfactual increase would have been in the LMCI if there had been an increase of 200,000 in payroll employment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker acknowledges that they don't have an answer, implying a disagreement or lack of consensus on the topic of the counterfactual increase in the LMCI.


Passage number 155.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Plosser is thanking Chair Yellen and then President Williams is presumably about to speak.


Passage number 156.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 157.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  After hearing what David said about cocktail party conversation around the employment report, I realized why many of us are not invited to cocktail parties.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It only mentions that many individuals are not invited to cocktail parties, without expressing any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 158.
  [Laughter]   MR. WILCOX.  Maybe this has to do with why he gets a few invitations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage consists of a statement and a response, both of which express agreement and humor as indicated by the laughter. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 159.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided to analyze. Please provide the passage in question.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 160.
 WILLIAMS.  I have a couple of questions around the Tealbook and the forecast.  I’m trying to understand a couple of issues a little bit better.  One is on fiscal impetus.  The reason I ask is, we still do have in our FOMC statement—and I think we’ll continue to have—a sentence that says, “Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing,” which I’m sure is factually correct.  I did do a little bit of careful reading of the Tealbook because there’s this wonderful box that goes through that, and it was very helpful.  And then if you go to the Greensheets, there’s actually a line there, quarter by quarter, on federal fiscal impetus.  But I was curious about what the quarterly pattern of total fiscal impetus is, because, at least based on my calculations, we’re probably down to minus a tenth or two in the second half of this year.  So my question is, is that roughly right, and is that really a major factor in thinking about holding back the economy now relative to early this year, when it clearly was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. In the passage, Williams is questioning the extent of fiscal restraint and its impact on economic growth, suggesting that it may not be as significant as previously thought. This contrasts with the FOMC statement which acknowledges fiscal policy as a restraining factor.


Passage number 161.
 MR. ENGEN.  Yes, that is certainly the case.  The follow-up memo on the forecast noted that federal spending came in a little bit stronger in the third quarter.  We’re now down to roughly minus one tenth percent on total fiscal impetus in the second half.  Now, one thing that would tend to make that a little more negative is that there are still some multiplier effects going on, so you could lower it another tenth for the second half to account for that.  But, clearly, with the data we have in hand on both federal and state and local purchases over the first half of the year and into the third quarter, we are seeing it decelerate, and it is getting small.  As you noted, the projection we reported in the box is that total fiscal impetus will be about zero for next year.  So I think it is the case that not only is it diminishing, but it’s also really becoming less of a factor for the overall forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and analysis based on the data and projections they have, without any contradictory statements or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 162.
   MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 163.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you.  My second question is on “The Foreign Economic Outlook,” chart 2, in which the red dotted line shows the effect of the €1 trillion LSAP on economic growth and then in chart 4 its effect on inflation.  Could you remind me how you viewed the effects of a euro-area, trillion-euro LSAP relative to all of the analysis we saw around U.S. LSAPs—the effects on financial conditions and how that feeds through the economy.  Are these bigger or smaller effects in terms of bang for the buck in the euro area versus what we assume for the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 164.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, we certainly followed on the analysis of U.S. LSAPs when we did these estimates.  We, in fact, started with the estimates in your article with Dave Reifschneider, Hess Chung, and Jean-Philippe Laforte.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker followed the analysis of U.S. LSAPs and started with the estimates in an article.


Passage number 165.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 166.
 WILLIAMS.  I’ve got my citation.  I’m okay now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Williams, states that they have their citation and are now okay, indicating a resolution or agreement.


Passage number 167.
  [Laughter] MR. KAMIN.  It’s also got the website, which you can just click on.  We started with those estimates, and, frankly, we thought they might be a little bit high for the euro area for a couple of reasons:  first of all, greater uncertainty surrounding both the prospects and implementation of the program; and, second, the fact that the euro area is perhaps more bank driven than the United States.  So, for various reasons, we basically halved those estimates, and then we used those to apply to the 10-percent-of-GDP LSAP for the euro area that we’re assuming.  The rest of it just followed through our SIGMA perfect foresight model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their thought process and the reasons for adjusting estimates.


Passage number 168.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not contain any disagreement or contention as it only includes the abbreviation "MR," which does not provide any context for agreement or disagreement.


Passage number 169.
 WILLIAMS.  Great.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite exchange of thanks between two individuals.


Passage number 170.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a couple of questions.  One question is on the unemployment rate in the forecast for the domestic economy.  When does it come back, in the staff’s forecast, to the natural rate.  I should be more specific, I guess.  It   comes back originally around mid-2016, I think, continues to go down, and then returns eventually to stabilize at some point in the next decade.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 171.
 MR. WILCOX.  It’s a long time.  The last figure I have printed is 5.0 in 2019.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement of information without any conflicting opinions or contrasting viewpoints.


Passage number 172.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  So the forecast anticipates several years below the natural rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement about a forecast anticipating several years below the natural rate.


Passage number 173.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes, but the margin is pretty small and this time is considerably smaller than it was in the July Tealbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Wilcox is simply stating facts about the margin and time.


Passage number 174.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That’s right.  Thanks for reminding me of that.  I have a question about the European situation.  I probably should know this, and I just don’t.  The nominal bond yields, even on long-term bonds, have gotten very low in Europe.  If we were to try to do a decomposition, what would term premiums look like for, say, German bonds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a question and providing some background information. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 175.
 MR. KAMIN.  We have some estimates of that.  We’re not, obviously, perfectly certain of them.  Let me dig that up for a second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they have some estimates, but they are not entirely certain about them.


Passage number 176.
 MR. POTTER.  We’re probably pretty sure on the sign.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Potter is confident about something.


Passage number 177.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, okay—yes.  Well, my recollection is that it’s actually straddling the zero line a little bit.  For Germany, looking at this, our latest estimate for a decomposition of the 10-year bond yield is, in fact, a term premium that’s very slightly below zero, with the rest of it being the average expected interest rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their perspective or recollection on a specific topic, but there is no argument or disagreement present.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 178.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I ask the question because, when Governor Stein was here, he offered some thoughts about how the level of the term premium could interact with the effectiveness of an LSAP program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Governor Stein offered some thoughts about the interaction between the level of the term premium and the effectiveness of an LSAP program, indicating a difference in perspective or opinion on the matter.


Passage number 179.
 MR. KAMIN.  Certainly.  Following on our earlier discussion, LSAPs for the euro area would, in principle, push down that term premium into more negative territory.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kamin is simply stating a hypothetical outcome of implementing LSAPs for the euro area.


Passage number 180.
   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right.  Thanks.  Then I had a question, and I think I did the calculation right:  Regarding the number of participants who, in their SEP submissions, had the unemployment rate going below their long-run estimate of the natural rate, it looked to me as though 12 out of the 17 had that feature.  Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 181.
 MS. DEBOER.  That sounds about right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply agrees with the statement being made.


Passage number 182.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange of statements between Mr. Kocherlakota and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 183.
 MR. FISCHER.  This is a question for Steve.  You said that you have a forecast that the dollar is going to weaken at some point.  Now, in the abstract, yes, it’ll happen one day.  But what causes you to say that, and when will it happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer is simply asking Steve about his forecast and the reasoning behind it.


Passage number 184.
 MR. KAMIN.  I’m not just saying it—it’s our forecast.  But I don’t know if that should give it more weight or not.  [Laughter]  I guess what I’d say is, we have an established methodology.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely acknowledging uncertainty and expressing that their forecast is based on an established methodology.


Passage number 185.
 MR. FISCHER.  It’s getting clearer and clearer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The statement "It's getting clearer and clearer" doesn't indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that something is becoming more evident or understandable.


Passage number 186.
 MR. KAMIN.  I would stop now, but I don’t think I’ve even begun to answer your question.  First of all, in terms of the “when,” it’s shown in your exhibit 2, in the second panel.  Against the emerging market economies, we have the dollar starting to fall beginning in the next few quarters and moving forward.  We have further appreciation over the next quarters and next several years against the advanced foreign economies.  Now, as to why that is, let me start with the more standard example of the advanced foreign economies.  The way we project the dollar against those currencies is, we basically look at anticipations of both U.S. interest rates and foreign interest rates, and we assume that the current level of the exchange rate incorporates the market’s expectations of these future trajectories, but that, if the market down the road is going   to be surprised by either U.S. rates or foreign rates, then the currency will move commensurately.  So in our projection, we think that the markets will be surprised by how quickly U.S. interest rates lift off, and, as a result, the dollar will rise further against those currencies.  And that accounts for the upward trajectory against them. Turning to the emerging market economies, we think that a key factor here is going to be China’s exchange rate choices.  In particular, as they move toward continued rebalancing of their economy, they will allow their currency—which, we believe, still remains somewhat undervalued—to appreciate over time.  As they do that, their Asian neighbors will also allow their currencies to appreciate, albeit somewhat more slowly, and that’s what accounts for the downward slope in the dollar against the EMEs in our forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining the author's projections and beliefs about the future trajectory of the dollar against different economies. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 187.
 MR. FISCHER.  You’ve got one going down and one going up, and the net is negative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about two different values—one is decreasing and the other is increasing, resulting in a negative net value.


Passage number 188.
 MR. KAMIN.  The net is negative because the emerging market economies represent a progressively larger share of our trade—it now exceeds 50 percent—and because we have steeper depreciation against the emerging markets than we have appreciation against the advanced foreign economies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is describing a situation without expressing conflicting or contradictory views.


Passage number 189.
 MR. FISCHER.  Do you have growth factors in this as well.  Is the balance of payments also in this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward question asking whether growth factors and the balance of payments are included in something.


Passage number 190.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, let’s put it this way:  We take that into account, let’s say, more judgmentally.  For example, the real value of the dollar against the Latin American currencies actually appreciates slightly over the forecast period because, in the aggregate, we think that their current account deficits are somewhat greater than the market is satisfied with.  The opposite, of course, is true for the Asian currencies, and so that, along with their rebalancing motives, leads to the appreciation of their currencies in our forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the evaluation of the dollar against different currencies based on current account deficits and rebalancing motives.


Passage number 191.
   MR. FISCHER.  How much does 1 percent on, let’s say, your broad index give us on the price level in the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 192.
 MR. KAMIN.  Let me check that.  I think the answer is, not a huge amount.  What I’m going to do is to provide you with some estimates based on our SIGMA model, and then perhaps David could elaborate.  Basically, the way we have it now is that a 1 percent appreciation of the dollar would lead to an almost minimal reduction in both core and headline inflation.  Maybe it would be easier to talk about these numbers in terms of a 10 percent fall in the dollar.  A 10 percent fall in the dollar, for example, would boost our core inflation by maybe 0.2 percentage point and headline inflation by about the same amount—not a great effect.  Does that work for you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing estimates and asking for confirmation if they align with the listener's understanding.


Passage number 193.
 MR. WILCOX.  Works for me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Works for me" implies agreement and satisfaction with the situation, indicating no disagreement or contention.


Passage number 194.
 MR. FISCHER.  I heard a different message yesterday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement simply states that the speaker heard a different message yesterday without expressing agreement or disagreement.


Passage number 195.
 MR. WILCOX.  The message you heard yesterday pertained to real activity, not to inflation.  There’s a fairly substantial effect on the terms of trade and on real activity, which is quantitatively, I think, much more important than the figures that Steve just cited with respect to inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is stating a difference in focus between two different topics - real activity and inflation. There is no clear disagreement or contention between the speakers.


Passage number 196.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Steve, are these just the direct first-round effects, though.  Are you assuming that there’s a macro GDP effect that also feeds in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is seeking clarification or additional information from Steve.


Passage number 197.
 MR. KAMIN.  The numbers that I cited—this might be useful to talk about—are actually the full general-equilibrium effects.  Among other things, they take into account some offsetting monetary policy responses that you would expect under these circumstances. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a dialogue between Mr. Kamin and Chair Yellen where Mr. Kamin shares some numbers and Chair Yellen responds.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 198.
   MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to ask about exhibit 1, “The Foreign Economic Outlook,” and the €1 trillion LSAP.  I’m looking at these figures, and I’m interpreting you to be saying that these are conditional.  The red dotted line is conditional on the ECB entering into further LSAPs that are sovereign debt based.  My question is, if you look at the German 10-year yield in figure 5 here, it has fallen about 100 basis points since the beginning of the year.  Some of that could be interpreted as anticipatory effects that have already occurred.  So isn’t some of the LSAP effect already in the European data.  Some of the effects should be showing up in the European data over the forecast horizon even though they haven’t actually done a program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, is expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of the LSAP (Large-Scale Asset Purchase) program and questioning whether its effects are already being reflected in the European data. This is in contrast to the assumption being made by the person being questioned, as indicated by the use of conditional language and the reference to the red dotted line.


Passage number 199.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes, I think that, as a matter of logic, that’s certainly possible—how much of it is very difficult to parse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Kamin expressing his belief that something is logically possible, but the degree to which it is possible is difficult to determine.


Passage number 200.
 MR. BULLARD.  I think we sometimes found with our own program that the actual adoption of the program was greeted with a yawn.  The anticipation of the program was where all of the action occurred, at least in financial markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their observation about the adoption of a program, indicating that the excitement and attention were focused on its anticipation rather than its actual implementation.


Passage number 201.
 MR. KAMIN.  Right.  Exactly.  Just to be clear, some of our LSAP programs have been well telegraphed in advance and thus, when they were actually instituted, not hugely market moving.  It is certainly possible that some portion of market moves over the past few months has been anticipation of an eventual LSAP focus on sovereign debt purchases.  But, certainly, as of a few months ago or April, that was remote in most people’s appraisal, and even right now, it’s certainly not the likeliest outcome.  Simon, you were citing a 40 percent probability.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the possibility of market moves and the likelihood of LSAP focus on sovereign debt purchases.


Passage number 202.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes, it was a Reuters poll before the last meeting.  It was 40 percent, which surprised me at how high it was, and I assume that went up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 203.
   MR. KAMIN.  I would say that the lion’s share of this estimated effect probably would go through if they announced the program right now, because it would be extremely unexpected to all market participants if they actually started this program—for example, announced it at their October meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion or belief about the potential effect of announcing a program at the October meeting.


Passage number 204.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, why don’t we begin our economic go-round.  We’ll start with President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a transition from one speaker to another.


Passage number 205.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My forecast is broadly consistent with the Tealbook forecast.  I expect economic growth above potential, but my unemployment rate forecast does not reach full employment of 5¼ percent until the second half of 2016.  This forecast reflects analysis that suggests U-3 is underestimating the degree of slack in the labor market.  As the labor market continues to improve, I am still optimistic about both the number of workers who will return to the labor force and movement of part-time workers to full-time employment.  As in the Tealbook, my PCE inflation rate does not reach the 2 percent inflation target during the forecast horizon, resulting in a continuation of our persistent undershooting of the inflation target we set.  Because I do not expect to reach full employment until the second half of 2016 and don’t anticipate attaining our inflation target until after that, I expect to delay liftoff until we are within one year of attaining full employment—in essence, a patient monetary policy. The determination of the degree of labor market slack is an important determinant of when I think liftoff should begin.  Comparing state labor market indicators with pre-recession levels makes clear that there is significant slack in many local markets.  For example, the share of workers working part time for economic reasons remains more than 1 percentage point above   pre-recession levels in 37 states, including most of the states badly impacted by the financial crisis, many of which have significant populations. While I expect that real GDP will grow faster than potential through the forecast horizon, there is noticeable downside risk to this forecast.  Residential investment poses one downside risk.  Although residential investment is an important driver of economic growth above potential in my outlook, it has recently been weaker than one might have expected given still-low interest rates, rising housing prices, and improvements in wealth.  Some of this weakness might reflect long-lived behavioral changes that have arisen in the wake of the financial crisis.  For example, credit remains scarce for individuals with FICO scores below 640, something that no doubt reduces the number of potential first-time homebuyers.  Credit for many of these potential buyers has been impaired by the weak economy, large student loan debt, and the diminished job prospects that many graduating from school have faced during or after the financial crisis.  This may be one reason why models that the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston staff typically use continue to overpredict household formation and residential investment. In addition to the lingering concerns about how domestic households and firms might change behavior in response to the recent recession, international concerns provide additional downside risks.  The movement to partition in several existing European countries could reduce economic vibrancy in the area.  Whether that partition occurs through possible democratic means in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Spain or by force, as in several of the former members of the Soviet Union, we need to realize that Europe could remain a drag on the global economy for several years.  The increased conflict in the Middle East also adds downside risk to the outlook. With the uncertain geopolitical situation, it is not surprising that too low an inflation rate is the primary concern of many of our major trading partners.  To a lesser extent, this is an   important concern for the United States as well.  With Europe experiencing a very low rate of inflation, weak economic growth, and thus a tendency of the euro to devalue to expand exports to the United States, U.S. inflation may be lower than we expect.  With the ECI indicating little wage pressure, significant slack still remaining in labor markets, and disinflationary global forces, my forecast suggests very slow progress to our 2 percent inflation target will continue for several more years, consistent with the persistent undershooting of our inflation target that has occurred since 2008.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their own forecast and analysis, but there is no mention of opposing or conflicting views.


Passage number 206.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  We met with a number of banking contacts in the intermeeting period in Montana and Minnesota.  These states are relatively healthy economically.  They both have unemployment rates around 4.5 percent.  Nonetheless, the information from our contacts remained mixed.  We did hear about some signs of life in loan demand.  In particular, for the first time in years, contacts reported that borrowers were expanding their usage of existing lines of credit.  At the same time, though, many contacts continue to be concerned about downside risks to the U.S. macroeconomy, like persistent low economic growth.  We tried to dig into the possibility that the low interest rate environment was creating irresponsible lending practices.  We heard nothing like that—in fact, quite the contrary.  Banks reported that they and their competitors viewed relatively few loans as being creditworthy.  There was intense competition for those few loans, and that competition has resulted in relaxed terms and conditions, but our contacts did not see that relaxation as resulting in excessively risky loans because of the underlying quality of the credit involved. This is obviously only a small snapshot of a small portion of the economy, although I should say that some of the banks we talked to do have national footprints.  But, in the past, I’ve   emphasized that possible financial instability should matter for monetary policy only insofar as that instability is creating sufficiently large risks to our dual-mandate outcomes.  The evidence in Carmen Reinhart’s work and elsewhere suggests to me that, if instability is to be relevant for our macroeconomic goals, it should, in fact, engage wide swaths of the economy, not just narrow slices of financial markets.  In particular, for financial instability to be macroeconomically relevant, we should see at least some imprint of it in Main Street lending practices.  So far, we’re not seeing that imprint in Montana and Minnesota, despite their strong economies. Let me turn now to the national economy.  The big change in my SEP submission since June is that I have taken on board the staff’s assessment that the underlying rate of inflation in the economy is 1.75 percent.  To be precise, this means that the inflation rate will converge to 1.75 percent in the absence of further shocks and if slack converges to zero.  Hence, the inflation rate returns to target in the Tealbook’s modal outlook only because the outlook is for the unemployment rate to fall below the natural rate temporarily, although, as I just discussed with David in our exchange, “temporarily” is actually a fairly long time.  Similarly, under appropriate monetary policy, my modal outlook is for the unemployment rate to fall below the natural rate, which I currently gauge to be 5 percent, for some period of time.  Now, as I mentioned to Marnie, I noted with interest in the SEP that 12 out of 17 participants have submitted projections that have the same property of the unemployment rate going below their estimates of the longer-run natural rate, at least for some period of time. This aspect of our outlooks and the Tealbook’s raises an important communication issue for us as a Committee.  The July statement and our draft alternatives for this meeting do not communicate that the Committee expects that the unemployment rate will fall below longer-run levels consistent with its dual mandate.  Indeed, I would argue that the statement, in fact, implies   the exact opposite.  The Committee’s modal outlook is that the unemployment rate will not fall below a level consistent with the longer-run estimates of maximum employment.  Because of our outlooks and the outlook in the Tealbook, I would say it would be highly desirable for the statement to say explicitly that the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will fall for some time below the natural rate of unemployment.  This kind of transparency about our collective assessment of the economy would boost households’ expectations about future macroeconomic outcomes and thereby facilitate faster progress toward our macroeconomic goals. To sum up what I am trying to say here, the Tealbook outlook and two-thirds of SEP participants expect the unemployment rate to fall below their estimates of the natural rate.  The FOMC statement seems to imply the opposite—that the unemployment rate will simply converge to the longer-run natural rate from above.  I think this lack of transparency about our collective outlook is robbing the economy of useful near-term stimulus, and, Madam Chair, I hope that we can find a way to fix this gap in our communications in the near future.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer, do you want to make a two-handed intervention.

 MR. FISCHER.  Yes. CHAIR YELLEN.  You may.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 208.
 MR. FISCHER.  I don’t think you can make that statement without saying that there’s a probability of 45 percent that it will not fall below its longer-run level.  The ranges of uncertainty are so massive that sending strong messages about what’s going to happen three years from now seems to me to be potentially misleading.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer argues that making a statement without acknowledging the probability of the exchange rate not falling below its longer-run level is potentially misleading. This implies that there is a disagreement about the accuracy and potential implications of making such statements.


Passage number 209.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Governor Fischer, I take your point.  I think we should be careful to communicate uncertainty about our forecasts on an ongoing basis.  The Chair did that   wonderfully in her March press conference, and that’s a point we should always be making.  That said, I believe that the verbal communication I’m pointing to would give the public a better sense of our reaction function to economic conditions and how we’re thinking about the path for appropriate monetary policy.  What kinds of conditions do we want to try to achieve through the arc of our appropriate monetary policy.  I think it’s very informative about what the Committee is trying to get to in terms of macroeconomic outcomes.  But I take your point, and I agree with you completely that it’s appropriate for us to be clearer, perhaps, than we always are about the level of uncertainty associated with those forecasts. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is agreement in this passage. Both Mr. Kocherlakota and Chair Yellen agree that it is important to communicate uncertainty about forecasts and to be clearer about the level of uncertainty associated with those forecasts.


Passage number 210.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On balance, economic activity in the Fifth District has continued to expand.  Over the summer we’ve seen substantial improvement in our indexes for manufacturing and service-sector activity.  The preliminary September survey numbers, due out on the 23rd—this is confidential until then—also look pretty good. Anecdotal reports, however, are more of a mixed bag.  They generally run positive, but businesses are cautious about increases in hiring or investment, and the pullback in federal spending is continuing to have large effects in some areas.  Defense cutbacks have led to pronounced sluggishness in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia and around selected military bases in eastern North Carolina.  Growth in high-paying jobs in professional and business services has slowed dramatically in the D.C. area, with outright declines evident in Northern Virginia. We continue to hear widespread reports of labor shortages, but we are not yet seeing signs of broad-based wage acceleration.  While many of the shortages are in IT or certain skill groups, several contacts lamented that they’re having difficulty finding workers with the appropriate work ethic and the ability to pass a drug test.  An auto industry contact reports   bottlenecks due to a lack of skilled technical workers.  There was one report from a textile firm that a lack of skilled labor is a big and growing problem.  Apparently, this is not your father’s textile industry. One obvious response to a skill shortage is for firms to arrange training for their employees, and we’ve seen evidence that this is taking place.  We do hear about firms building their own training programs, and, in one region in which advanced manufacturing is prevalent, virtually all such firms are said to be involved in apprenticeship programs with the local community college. The other obvious response to a skill shortage is to pay more, and we are hearing about wage pressures for certain hot skills.  The CEO of a software firm specializing in health benefit systems—who, by the way, is reporting strong business driven by ACA compliance—says she will have to budget 4 to 4½ percent next year for wage increases for her tech workers.  A contact who’s close to the machinists union is seeing wage settlements averaging 2 percent for this coming year but 3 to 3½ percent for 2016 and 2017.  The CEO of a staffing firm in the Carolinas says he believes higher nominal wage growth is imminent in several fields.  So instances of accelerating compensation are obviously not inconsistent with stable relative wage trends, because you’d expect to see relative wages change over time as the composition of labor demand evolves.  The reports we hear do not suggest an across-the-board pickup in wage gains of the type you’d expect to see during a broader inflationary surge.  Moreover, while we heard some scattered reports of improved pricing power earlier this year, comments about pricing pressures or rising inflation have been notably absent of late.  As an aside, though, a lack of evidence of broad-based acceleration in wages and prices is not cause for complacency.  If we wait until we   do see that, we will have waited too long.  And we didn’t wait that long, I’d note, when we tightened in 1994. On the national projections, I was struck by the extent to which the Tealbook has lowered its forecast for consumer spending and private investment.  As a result, it looks as if the staff has more or less abandoned hope of achieving 3 percent real GDP growth on a sustained basis anytime soon.  Over the past five years, there have been numerous sightings of 3-plus percent economic growth just a couple of quarters ahead, and yet each has proven to be a mirage.  I, too, was fooled by many of those sightings and, accordingly, sent in projections of acceleration that never materialized.  I reconciled myself, however, to the notion that, no matter what econometric oases shimmer in the distance, the next stretch of road—to use your car trip metaphor, Madam Chair—is likely to closely resemble the last.  In other words, the landscape in Iowa is looking a lot like Nebraska.  Illinois appears likely to look the same as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and observations about economic activity in the Fifth District and national projections, without expressing any disagreement or contradictory opinions.


Passage number 211.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That’s so untrue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "That's so untrue" indicates that the speaker believes the previous statement to be false, but it does not suggest any ongoing contention or disagreement.


Passage number 212.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  At the same time, the staff’s forecast does still call for a notable acceleration in GDP—2.7 percent next year and 2.9 percent the year after that.  The driving force appears to be a sustained pickup in productivity growth from around 1 percent, which is the average rate we’ve seen since the recession, to around 1¾ percent.  Without that productivity growth, compensation wouldn’t accelerate.  Without that, real income wouldn’t accelerate.  And without that, consumer spending wouldn’t accelerate, and so on.  Forecasting medium-term swings in labor productivity growth is notoriously difficult.  Uncertainty is substantial around whatever forecast one writes down.  So I have to admit that that kind of acceleration is certainly not implausible.  My own sense, though, is that we’re more likely to see numbers like we’ve seen   over the past few years, so my projections are predicated on productivity growth continuing to average around 1 percent. My projection is for real GDP to grow at 2.1 percent in 2015 and 2016, and I believe that that will be consistent with continuing improvement in labor market conditions.  I expect the labor force participation rate to decline 0.2 percentage point a year, along the lines shown in the Tealbook, in which the projection in the outyears has been pulled down a bit for this meeting.  I’m projecting an unemployment rate of 5 percent at the end of 2016 and 2017.  And, finally, my projections for both headline and core inflation are that they will hit 2 percent in 2016, a bit sooner than in the Tealbook.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mostly a statement of different projections and forecasts made by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 213.
   MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’ll start this time with my outlook and then add some color from our conversations over the recent weeks.  I submitted a forecast of above-trend growth for this quarter and next and through next year of around 3 percent, with the U-3 unemployment rate ending the year at 6 percent and next year at 5½ percent.  In my medium-term outlook, inflation remains below the Committee’s target until 2016.  My forecast is little changed from the June submission, and the incoming data have fed growing confidence on my part in this basic outlook. In terms of the basic narrative, I see little distinction between my forecast and the current Tealbook baseline.  As regards my characterization of appropriate policy, I have liftoff in the third quarter of 2015, a little later than the Tealbook.  Once initiated, my working assumption for now is a deliberate pace of increases in the federal funds rate target range at 25 basis points per meeting, in line with precedent and a somewhat steeper trajectory than implied by the Tealbook path.  I might be overestimating a concern, but, at some point, I think the Committee will have to   discuss how we would operationalize a more gradual trajectory of rates and the communication challenges that might accompany a pattern other than 25 basis points per meeting.  But that’s not a subject for this meeting. Now, turning to District input, during the intermeeting period, we focused our questions on business confidence in a 3 percent growth outlook; insights on consumer spending; and employment and hiring conditions, particularly wage pressures.  Business sentiment remains generally upbeat, and the pulse of economic activity appears to have strengthened.  Industrial activity has been strong, and our tourism and transportation industries are still reporting robust conditions.  Activity in residential real estate markets has improved from earlier in the year, although, like others, we heard reports of labor and material shortages constraining homebuilding.  We heard mixed reports on consumer spending, depending on sector and subregion.  The overall impression was of fairly lackluster consumer activity.  Bankers in our District mostly reported improved credit demand across a spectrum of customer types and products.  Regarding hiring conditions, we heard more comments indicating a shortage of qualified job applicants.  In a handful of specialized occupations, we heard reports of upward wage pressure on offer wages.  Overall, however, the demand for additional workers does not seem to have changed markedly from the experience of recent years.  To quote one contact, “No one is going long labor.”  Our practice in evaluating District inputs is to look for disconnects between descriptions of conditions on the ground and incoming data.  This time around, what we heard broadly conforms to the incoming data. As regards the risks to the outlook around my forecast, I’m treating the risks to growth and inflation as broadly balanced.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a summary of Mr. Lockhart's outlook and the information he obtained from conversations and district inputs. There is no active disagreement or conflicting opinions expressed.

Explanation: The passage is a statement made by someone ("Mr. Fisher") expressing an observation or opinion ("Look at what you did—you restructured a whole industry"). There is no indication of contention or disagreement within the passage.


Passage number 216.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  My economic assessment has changed very little since my June SEP submission.  It’s a lot like David’s Tealbook discussion.  The economy still seems poised for reasonably solid growth of 3 percent or so over the next 18 months.  Most of the recent data have been pretty good.  Orders for capital goods in the ISM surveys point to a good pickup in business investment, and the consumer outlook seems on a better footing after the recent retail sales and quarterly services reports.  Although the August jobs data were disappointing, the longer perspective is that employment has been growing more than 200,000 per month for quite some time.  And, given the usual volatility in these numbers, we shouldn’t be too surprised by the occasional bump in the road. The improved incoming data match well with what I’ve been hearing from business contacts.  They have been noting good and improving conditions for the past several meetings, but, over the past couple of months, the reports have become more uniformly positive.  I’m now hearing the phrase “best since 2007” quite often.  For example, my director who’s the CEO of a large electric utility reported that orders for electrical services from new businesses are the best since before the recession.  This might be a signal of improving start-up activities.  In the manufacturing sector, a number of our contacts are increasing capital expenditures.  Every other year in September, Chicago hosts the large International Manufacturing Technology Show.  This year’s show drew heavy traffic, and the tone from both buyers and sellers was quite upbeat.   Meanwhile, bankers are reporting that a stronger economy and increased business confidence are showing through to robust growth in outstanding C&I loan balances.  Businesses now are actually drawing on credit lines and not just setting up new commitments. All of this is leading to some progress on employment.  For example, our director who leads a labor union said that the increase in construction in and around Chicago has put people back to work and has led to expanded apprenticeship programs and skilled tradesmen being induced to come out of retirement.  At least in this instance—and, apparently, in the case of Dave Reifschneider—retirement doesn’t appear to be an absorbing state.  [Laughter] Even though my forecast hasn’t changed, I have more confidence that my 3 percent outlook for economic growth might actually happen over the next several quarters.  Of course, that’s still not a slam dunk.  Housing is a reminder that we still face significant headwinds, and there are international risks that could still weigh on economic growth.  The United States continues to be the bright spot in the global economy.  I hear that from a lot of businesspeople.  And we’ll be doing well if the rest of the world is a neutral influence on us over the next couple of years. On the price front, inflation has come closer to target since the spring, but it’s still running well below our 2 percent objective for PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is running about 1½ percent, with the past couple of monthly readings back on the soft side. Wages continue to rise modestly at about a 2¼ percent rate.  That’s a long way from the benchmark of 3 to 4 percent implied by productivity growth and our inflation objective.  Wage dynamics are a somewhat subtle topic.  The historical evidence in the post-Volcker era is that wages don’t help predict inflation.  Of course, we shouldn’t forget that pretty much nothing helps predict inflation other than inflation.  That said, we still shouldn’t expect to get an increase in   inflation without a similar pickup in nominal wage growth.  I asked my research staff to investigate the co-movements of nominal wage growth and price inflation in our Chicago Fed DSGE model.  The basic result is that, following demandish-looking shocks, nominal wage growth and price inflation move together.  So if we think that the economy is near the point of overheating because of overly-accommodative monetary policy, then we should see the rate of wage increases moving up contemporaneously with inflation.  There’s simply not much evidence of that at the moment. Putting all of this together, I continue to expect that inflation will remain below our objective until at least 2017, even though output gaps are likely to be effectively eliminated sooner.  In my opinion, if these conditions were to transpire, appropriate monetary policy would delay the federal funds rate liftoff until early 2016.  Tomorrow I will talk more about risk-management issues at the zero lower bound that further strengthen the case for being very cautious about withdrawing accommodation.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is providing an assessment of the current economic situation and expressing their opinion on inflation and monetary policy.


Passage number 217.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Eighth District economy has expanded modestly during the intermeeting period.  A significant percentage of our business contacts expect economic conditions to improve over the second half of 2014.  Recent reports on retail and auto sales have been positive.  Residential real estate markets are generally soft, but there are areas experiencing accelerating activity.  Commercial construction appears to be on the rise.  District households continue to reduce their credit card or mortgage debt balances, but automotive debt balances continue to rise at a healthy rate. District labor markets continue to improve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information about the economy in a straightforward manner without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 218.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The 10th District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace.  Manufacturing activity expanded in August, and energy activity increased modestly, as drilling remains profitable despite declining crude oil prices.  The unemployment rates in all but two of the seven District states are currently below their longer-run averages.  Consistent with a tightening regional labor market, the growth in wages and salaries in the District picked up during the first half of the year compared with last year.  It is now slightly   higher than for the nation as a whole.  In the agriculture sector, the corn harvest is well under way, and it looks as though yields will be very high.  Accordingly, corn prices are nearly 40 percent below year-ago levels.  Cropland values are rising more slowly now compared with a year ago, and there are concerns prices could adjust lower over the medium term. At the national level, I continue to anticipate output growth at about 3 percent in the medium term.  Labor market gains, improving indicators for business investment, and the fading of fiscal headwinds are important factors supporting my forecast for a pickup in growth.  Regarding the labor markets, slack appears to have continued to decline steadily throughout the summer.  My staff’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators show that the level of activity increased in August at a faster pace than the average over the past 12 months.  So, while the payroll report for August indicated some deceleration in growth, a broad range of labor market conditions for August indicate that the overall pace of recovery in the labor market remains strong. As labor market slack continues to diminish, we are likely to see gradual increases in wage growth.  Already, average hourly earnings have firmed, and the employment cost index rebounded in the second quarter.  Analysis by my staff indicates that the growth in average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers is currently well aligned with the wage growth predicted by the number of job openings per unemployed person.  Based on that relationship between those variables during the last expansion, any further tightening is likely to lead to further gains in wage growth. On the spending side, last week’s Quarterly Services Survey and retail sales report helped resolve some of the puzzling softness in recent consumption data.  In addition, I’m encouraged by the strength in a number of forward-looking indicators—such as vehicle sales, the ISM services report, and consumer confidence—which have reached or surpassed levels not seen   since before the recession.  I also see the jump in the saving rate since last year as leaving some additional upside potential to consumption growth. Measures of business spending are also improving.  The growth of core capital goods shipments picked up considerably in June and July, and the elevated level of new orders signals further growth in the near term.  Other surveys, such as the share of firms planning capital expenditures reported by the NFIB and the ISM new orders index, also point to increasing forward momentum in capital spending.  With the average age of capital at its oldest in a half-century and amid rapid declines in economic policy uncertainty since December, there seems ample reason to expect robust growth in business investment. In terms of inflation, I expect a continued gradual firming as labor market slack diminishes further.  Import prices have turned up, and measures of inflation expectations remain consistent with 2 percent inflation in the medium term.  Considering these factors, I would not be surprised to see PCE inflation this year and the next coming close to the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ projection of 1.8 percent this year and 2 percent in 2015.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 220.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I do.  Thanks, Madam Chair.  I wanted to follow up on President Williams’s comment.  I certainly agree that the issue of the estimate of longer-run   inflation expectations or the underlying rate of inflation—whatever terminology you want to use—is a really important one for us to engage in more as a Committee.  We talked about it a little bit last time.  It seemed as though there were those who, as President Williams suggested himself, see the evidence differently from the staff and have a different assessment of that.  I heard some participants who felt that a longer-run inflation rate of 1.75 percent was consistent with their reading of our dual-mandate objectives.  And then there were those who suggested that a long time spent below the natural rate of unemployment, as is the staff outlook, could be a risk to inflation expectations.  All of those kinds of considerations would be useful for us to talk through. I think I emphasize the counting in the SEP because I was quite surprised by it, as I was prepared to try to persuade people to have that, and they were already there.  So it looks as though it’ll be your job to persuade them otherwise.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Some participants see evidence differently from the staff and have a different assessment of the longer-run inflation rate. Others suggest that a long time spent below the natural rate of unemployment could be a risk to inflation expectations. These differing views indicate a contention or disagreement among Committee members.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 221.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  My views have changed only modestly since the last meeting and are very close to the Tealbook and very close to everybody else around the table.  That said, on the growth side, the economy actually has slightly less forward momentum than I anticipated, and I’m a little less worried that the economy will get away from us on the upside.  Earlier in the year, I thought there was some chance that everything would catch, as you had increases of 250,000 per month in payroll employment, and that all things would start cycling up.  I don’t think that’s going to happen anymore.  On the inflation side, I don’t see much change at the margin.  Maybe we’re stuck a little bit more firmly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.   On economic growth, I’d make a couple of points.  First, I wouldn’t put much into the modest slowdown in payroll employment growth we saw the past couple of months.  The fact is, payroll gains were high relative to the growth pace earlier in the year.  So it shouldn’t surprise us now if we’re experiencing the reverse situation.  Second, I don’t see many sources that would fuel a meaningful pickup in the growth rate from here.  If you think we’re at 3 percent, what’s the likelihood we go to 4 to 5.  I think it’s pretty low.  The fact is, we’ve already experienced most, if not all, of the cyclical rebound in motor vehicle sales.  The cyclical sectors of the economy are no longer depressed cyclically.  And although the housing recovery will probably continue, I think it’s going to be a slog.  The sector is pretty small, so the contribution from housing can’t be very great.  At the margin, the outlook for trade has worsened a little bit, given that the dollar has strengthened.  While the forecast for economic growth is showing improvement as we go forward, at the margin, the risks regarding foreign growth have actually increased a bit from geopolitical tensions and developments in Europe, Japan, China—pretty broadly across the board. I asked myself the question:  Where would a pickup in the pace of economic growth come from.  I guess it would require some combination of a lower personal saving rate, higher real wages, or a faster rebound in capital spending.  But even if that were to occur, I don’t think the impulse, in the aggregate, would be very large.  Of the three, a further improvement in capital spending seems to be the most likely.  The fundamentals are quite positive in that sector.  And the businesspeople I talk to seem to be less risk averse and more willing to take on new projects.  Another support for faster economic growth could be the recent weakness in the prices of oil and gas.  If energy prices were to continue to soften, this would boost real income, and that would provide some further support to aggregate demand.   On the inflation side, we flattened out in terms of core inflation, about ½ percentage point short of our 2 percent inflation objective.  I don’t think this is a disaster, especially as long as nominal GDP growth remains north of an annual rate of 4 percent.  My anxiety about inflation is always tied back to what nominal GDP growth is, because I think that the deflation dynamics really flow through nominal GDP rather than directly through inflation.  At the same time, though, I don’t see why inflation is likely to climb in the near term.  I know there’s this pull from inflation expectations, but, on the other side, we have the fact that compensation trends are pretty low relative to actual inflation right now.  The impulses from abroad, from a stronger dollar, and domestically, from falling energy and food prices, are going to be more than sufficient to offset any upward pull from inflation expectations in the near term.  So I’m not concerned about inflation getting away on the upside, either. In terms of risks to the outlook, there are a couple of things that I still worry about.  I’m not going to say “mission accomplished” until we get to the point at which we actually lift off.  First, I worry a little about consumer spending growth because it does seem to be mostly based on job gains rather than real gains in compensation.  If the job gains were to slow, then does the consumption hold up.  Second, I do worry about the dollar strengthening that we’ve seen, and I worry that it could intensify and prove persistent.  In fact, I think to really understand the implications, it would be useful for the Tealbook to consider a scenario in which the dollar keeps strengthening—we had the questions earlier about this.  What does that do in terms of the economic growth and inflation outlook, and how much does it push back the timing of monetary policy tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage regarding the outlook for economic growth. One participant expresses concern about the lack of sources that could fuel a meaningful pickup in growth, while another participant mentions the possibility of a faster rebound in capital spending and the recent weakness in energy prices as potential supports for faster economic growth.


Passage number 222.
  MR. KAMIN.  We did one earlier in the year, but it was very mild.  We’ll dust that off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is about dusting off something they have done before.


Passage number 223.
   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Another one that would be interesting to consider is, what happens if this decline in oil prices continues.  The fact is, U.S. oil and gas liquids production is continuing to rise very rapidly.  I was looking at the EIA projections that came out earlier this month.  They’re projecting a further increase in output of 1.2 million barrels a day in 2015.  If you want to put that in context, at the start of 2012, we were producing 9½ million barrels of crude oil and gas liquids.  By the end of 2015, it’s going to be 14 million barrels.  That’s a pretty big increase in a pretty short time.  And if you go back and look at what the forecasts were back in 2006–07, the trend was flatter or declining.  So this is a huge gap relative to what people anticipated.  If geopolitical trends break in a more positive direction rather than a more negative direction, you can certainly see the possibility of energy prices coming down significantly.   What does all of this imply for monetary policy.  Well, it seems to me that we’re on the course that we thought we were on.  The only difference for me is that, at the July meeting, I could see how a March 2015 tightening might be very much in the cards if the payroll employment trends stayed firm, the unemployment rate continued to decline, and inflation continued to drift back up toward 2 percent.  Because none of those trends seem quite as clearly in place today as they were a few months ago, to me, a March tightening seems to be less likely. Given that, there doesn’t seem to be a big gap between our views as expressed in the SEP and the market consensus, especially, as the staff has mentioned, when you adjust for the fact that the SEP is a modal view and the market expectations are really a mean view, with some probability placed on no liftoff at all or a liftoff that’s aborted.  I don’t think we have a problem with expectations concerning the likely timing of liftoff.  So I don’t think we need to push one   way or the other at this meeting.  This is one of those situations in which “steady as you go” is the right course, and I’ll have more to say on that tomorrow. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting information and expressing their opinion, but there is no conflicting viewpoint mentioned.


Passage number 224.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Relative to where we were in June, we’re currently in a softish patch.  We’re still at 6.1 percent unemployment, which is much closer to full employment than the Committee expected to be about 18 months ago, but we’re not yet at full employment.  However, there are no signs in the data of an improvement in the labor force participation rate.  And the staff has marked down its downward-sloping prediction of the participation rate through 2017.  Some aspects of the labor market are looking better, particularly the fact that long-term unemployment has been coming down.  Here’s the bottom line:  With the staff forecast’s resumption of the decline in the unemployment rate for the remainder of this year to 5.9 percent, to 5.4 percent in 2015 at the end of the year, and to 5.1 percent in 2016, the unemployment rate continues to be the outstanding performer in terms of the many variables we look at to judge economic performance. On inflation, PCE inflation continues to be below 2 percent and appears likely to continue to be somewhat below 2 percent provided that wage growth remains moderate.  But as we get closer to full employment, we cannot rely on wages to remain as restrained as they have.  Now, this has been put more colorfully by President Fisher in terms of the things that he’s been hearing in his District, and, if I may say so, one of the many things one gets out of these meetings is listening to reports from different parts of the country, which, by the way, by and large, except for California—but that’s a different place.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and making observations about the current state of employment and inflation.

 MR. TARULLO.  And Texas isn’t.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: questionable.


Passage number 226.
  [Laughter]   MR. FISCHER.  If I could drop in a story, which probably I’m not allowed to, I was once writing a book with a colleague, Rudi Dornbusch, who is, unfortunately, no longer with us.  I was at Stanford, and Rudi used to come out for a week every now and then.  People would say to him, “How long are you here.”  And he would say, “I’m going back to America tomorrow.”  [Laughter]  But it’s encouraging, actually, to hear what you said about California. On economic growth and the dual mandate, the staff has raised the forecast for the second half of this year and actually raised the forecast for the first half of this year—this is relative to the Tealbook—by a not inconsiderable 0.2 percentage point following receipt of the data from the QSS and a revision of retail sales data for June and July.  They did this without changing their forecast for fourth-quarter growth or forecasts for future years. Now, part of the economic growth forecast is based on the current account remaining, by historical standards, strong, in part due to a pickup in foreign growth and in part due to an assumption that the dollar, which has strengthened sharply in the past year, will weaken in the years ahead.  Given the difficulty of forecasting the exchange rate, I would regard that element of the forecast as more uncertain than most and share the concerns about foreign growth that we just heard from, I think, President Williams.  I would add to that that Chinese growth looks a good deal less certain than it did a few years ago. There’s been a lot of attention lately to secular stagnation, the rate of productivity growth, the rate of technical progress, et cetera.  On the one hand, we have Larry Summers talking about secular stagnation, which he sees as a demand-side problem—namely, that the equilibrium real interest rate is negative, and that, without creating bubbles, booms, and other dubious sources of growth, we’re going to have trouble maintaining full employment and economic growth.  That’s very dramatic, and there are some people who prefer to be dramatic.   But there is another view, which is basically taken into account in the Tealbook, and that’s that there’s been a significant slowdown in technical progress.  You can have Bob Hall and Bob Gordon on one side—Bob Gordon explaining why everything that was worth discovering has been discovered and Joel Mokyr, his colleague at Northwestern University, explaining why many wonderful things await us when we have the next few breakthroughs.  I’m on the Mokyr side, but that’s just a matter of temperament, I think.  It’s clear that the rate of productivity growth has declined since 2006, and the staff estimates that trend multifactor productivity growth was just ¾ percent from 2010 to 2013.  In their projections, they’re assuming multifactor productivity growth of about 1 percent a year for the years 2015 to 2017.  So they’re not on the high side of this thing, and they’re not injecting excess optimism into the forecast. Now, one can ask, does it make any difference to monetary policy.  After all, we look at the unemployment rate.  Well, it’s still above where we’d like it to be.  We look at the inflation rate.  That’s still below where we’d like it to be.  Then we can just turn to the Taylor rule, and there we are—we can leave all of those arguments aside.  But if you look at page 60 of the Tealbook, Book A, as well as at the forecast and the assumptions that David Wilcox was emphasizing—you see the “No Room to Grow” scenario, which is red, and you’ll see that having a slowdown in productivity growth is a big problem.  In the macroeconomy, we get the lower growth, obviously.  We also have a higher unemployment rate, and, using our standard monetary policy tools, have a higher federal funds rate because we also have a higher inflation rate.  That picture is a very unsatisfactory one, as David told us.  On the other hand, if we got more labor force participation, that looks like an unambiguously good thing, from the viewpoint of the economy as a whole.  Actually, it mirrors, not exactly but not far off, the opposite of technical progress.  So these things really matter to us, not in the sense that we have to go out there and try   to affect them—that’s not our job, other than to the extent that we keep policy appropriate—but it is something we need to take into account and then remember that we’ll call that a headwind if that slowdown in productivity growth continues. Page 60 of the Tealbook, Book A, also draws our attention to the enormous uncertainty that besets our forecasts.  I personally feel quite uncomfortable being asked to give forecasts for the federal funds rate for 2017, because I think the uncertainty about what that rate will be is massive and is no less important—possibly it’s even more important—than our expectation of what the rate itself will be.  If we’re going to talk to the public, we need to continue to emphasize the high level of uncertainty that accompanies all of our forecasts, and we’d better tell savers, investors, and anyone else who’s thinking about the future that they have to take uncertainty into account in making their decisions.  We tend not do that, although, as somebody remarked earlier, the Chair has done a very good job of telling people about uncertainty not only in the press conference, but also in recent speeches. Well, to sum up, we are now—although we don’t seem to want to say that—relatively close to the attainment of the goals of the dual mandate.  But, as a result of what had to be done to prevent a second Great Depression, we still face monetary policy decisions of great importance and monetary policy decisions that lack precedent.  And that’s what we’re going to have to talk about later today, perhaps. CHAIR YELLEN.  Or tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists mostly of the speaker's personal thoughts, reflections, and observations on various economic issues.


Passage number 227.
 MR. FISCHER.  Or tomorrow.  Can you give us a clue or a hint. CHAIR YELLEN.  My guess is tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer is simply asking for a clue or hint regarding a certain topic, and Chair Yellen responds by stating her guess is that the information will be available tomorrow.


Passage number 228.
 MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  Let me amend that to say “tomorrow.”  [Laughter]  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  With uncertainty.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making a jovial remark and expressing gratitude.


Passage number 229.
   MR. FISCHER.  A lot of uncertainty around it.  Maybe Wednesday.  Or Thursday, you say. CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are simply discussing a timeline with uncertainty.


Passage number 230.
  I think tomorrow is higher probability  MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Governor Tarullo is simply thanking Chair Yellen.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 231.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me first say that I think Governor Fischer is ideally positioned to drive some changes in our communication strategy.  And I think we all look forward to ideas on how to improve the SEP and the communications issues more generally. I join in what sounds like a consensus around the table that things have continued to improve, both generally and in the labor market, to which I’ll turn in a moment.  Actually, in listening to everybody, people sounded a little bit more optimistic and a little bit more upside weighted than I would have characterized myself.  So I looked back at the famous SEP and found that, as a group, our expectations of risk on GDP growth are broadly balanced, with actually a few more people weighted to the downside than the upside.  I thought it was good that Vice Chairman Dudley gave a little bit of the case for caution as opposed to outright optimism. Having said that, though, I think everybody agrees that there’s been considerable improvement in the labor market.  It’s probably worth reminding ourselves that a lot of improvement was needed.  The hole that had been dug was close to being unprecedented, at least the speed with which that hole had been dug.  If you need a reminder, just take a look at the lower-left graph on page 2, I think it is, of the Data Sheets of the Tealbook.  You’ll see there, in the monthly job creation or destruction numbers, just how much those negative numbers plummeted in the 2008–09 period, and that’s a lot to make up.  In fact, it’s only relatively   recently that we now have in absolute terms the number of jobs that we had on January 1, 2008, notwithstanding the fact that there have been six and a half years of population growth since then. Now, none of that is to say that we’re going to get back there or what the actual trend is now.  As today’s discussion again showed, even after the couple of years of discussion and debate, we still have disagreement on how much slack remains.  Everyone agrees that a lot has been taken up, but how much does remain no one can really say for sure.  That leads to the kind of comments on the unemployment rate and the various other labor market indicators that we seem now to have at almost every meeting. I think the latest example of data that can be read multiple ways is the rate of job openings, which, as one or two people have mentioned, has risen quite dramatically through the first half of this year to such a degree that the rate is currently near the top of its range of what is, of course, a pretty short history.  Meanwhile, quits and hiring rates have only inched up during this period, continuing their very slow trend from 2009 that leaves them materially short of pre-crisis levels.  And, after a period of edging back toward its pre-crisis position, the Beveridge curve has again shifted out a little bit to the right. As we’ve discussed here in past meetings, the jump in job openings can be read as evidence of mismatch by those who believe that considerable structural damage has occurred in labor markets.  But those who believe the story still has an important cyclical element can and have read this change as a response to improving demand conditions and thus as a possible next step in a virtuous circle that will be followed by increases in hiring, which will further increase aggregate demand.  If you saw the New York Fed’s instant analysis of the JOLTS report last week, you’ll have noted a third explanation, one based on a kind of supply-side view that large   increases in unemployment benefit extensions may put upward pressure on wages and thereby suppress job creation.  In this view, the expiration of the emergency unemployment compensation program at the end of last year could be the source of the significant increase in job openings this year, presumably as employers see a larger pool of labor willing to work at lower wages. Now, how convincing the research on which this last hypothesis is based will prove to be remains to be seen.  The point, though, is that there are numerous plausible explanations for developments in a labor market that has been buffeted by forces arguably unprecedented in modern American economic history.  So we really can’t know if the quit rate or the percentage of those who are employed part time for economic reasons will ever return to their pre-crisis levels.  I suspect that, over the next decade, a lot will be learned about labor market dynamics that had been latent and was then amplified or accelerated by the crisis and recession.  But for now, as I’ve said before, we have to be pretty tentative in our conclusions about longer-run trends and more focused on pragmatic ways to determine when labor market slack is in its final stages of elimination.  I’ve thought and continue to think that it’s useful to exchange views among ourselves on what the best indicators for the approach of such a point are under these circumstances, when labor markets are surely becoming tight.  But the question remains, when do they get to the point at which they’ve now tightened more or less completely. As many people, I think, have already suggested, the best measure is probably the evidence of significant and reasonably widespread and persistent wage gains.  While such gains are now anticipated by more employers and labor market observers, they have yet to be realized to date except for hourly production workers, and, even for those workers, the average increase in wages over the past year was only 2½ percent, which is, of course, less than the sum of   inflation and productivity gains.  While sometimes noisy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, broader gauges of wages and compensation still reveal little evidence of a sustained step-up in the pace of compensation growth.  And if people are concerned about seeing earlier indicators of pressures in some sectors that might spread through the rest of the economy, there still hasn’t been much change in the distribution of wage gains across industries. A second possible indicator that slack is getting closer to disappearing might be rapid changes in some of the indicators that have thus far suggested continuing slack, such as the quits and part-time-for-economic-reasons rates.  A change of this sort wouldn’t be dispositive, of course, but it would raise the question of whether an inflection point might have been reached, which could then be investigated by reference to other data.  Another example of such a secondary indicator might be if we observe another significant increase in job openings without having seen an intervening noticeable pickup in hiring. Of course, with the link between general measures of inflation, on the one hand, and nominal wage growth and tighter labor markets, on the other, being a loose one, I don’t mean to suggest that the long-awaited arrival of larger sustained wage gains should be a mechanical trigger for changes in monetary policy, but that’s a debate for another day.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, expresses his disagreement with the optimism expressed by others in the meeting. He states that he is less optimistic about the economy and the labor market than others and mentions that the group's expectations of GDP growth are broadly balanced, with a few more people weighted to the downside than the upside.


Passage number 232.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My SEP submission is close to the staff baseline—in fact, it is the baseline—for output and unemployment, and, as others have pointed out, that has economic growth at less than 3 percent.  As an aside, I think it’s quite interesting that, as others have pointed out, 2013 has now been marked to 3.1 percent, remembering that that’s the year of very large fiscal headwinds, including the sequester, the “taper tantrum,” and   the government shutdown.  If you think about that, it didn’t really feel like a great year going through it—to me, anyway.  But it may say something, even though some of that economic growth may have been stolen from Q1 of this year, about the underlying strength of the economy in the period ahead that we’re underestimating. In any case, on this path, the unemployment rate will be within the central tendency of the Committee’s estimates of full employment by late next year and below that tendency by the end of 2016, and that’s true for my forecast as well.  As many have indicated, the big question is, how much slack is remaining.  I won’t go on at length about this, but it’s still my view that the share of people working part time for economic reasons is about 2 percentage points higher than it should be relative to where the headline unemployment is.  If you know that people who are part time for economic reasons are working about 23 hours a week, you can cut that in half and say it’s about 1 percent of slack at the most.  Again, that does assume that that new, higher level of people working part time for economic reasons doesn’t represent a structural change in the labor market, which, to some extent, it might. Another question concerns the labor force participation rate and whether it might retrace some of the declines since 2007.  The baseline estimate is that there might be about ½ percentage point of a cyclical component out of a total decline since 2007 of almost 3 percentage points, and that’s in the middle of the range estimated by the very recent and widely noticed paper on the labor force participation rate by six Federal Reserve economists—five from the Board and one from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.  That also seems to be in the middle of the ballpark of what might be a reasonable thing to expect.  That paper also projects that labor force participation should decline another 2½ percent over the next decade, or about 25 basis points a   year, and the path described in the paper shows the rate essentially flat as the economy continues to recover through 2015 and then declining steadily over the coming decade. Interesting to me is that, if you look through some of the volatility, the labor force participation rate has been about flat for a full year, including the fourth quarter of last year, at 62.8 percent.  There’s not a high degree of accuracy in this, nor is it a prediction or anything, but if the path estimated by the staff paper is directionally right, then a few years of labor force participation at 63 percent, give or take a couple of tenths, are one way that the cyclical return of the labor force might actually show itself. Given these baseline levels of economic growth and unemployment, I have projected a slightly faster return of inflation to the 2 percent objective.  My thinking is not so much that expectations will move around, as discussed in the staff series of interesting memos, but rather that inflation will turn out to be more responsive to very low and, in fact, negative levels of slack that are in the baseline and in my forecast.  I think that idea is supported by the fact that the last time output was above potential, by our current estimates, for a series of years was the period from 2004 to 2007.  During that period, inflation, both core and headline, was consistently above 2 percent, and I’m not sure what the performance of inflation since then, in conditions of superabundant slack, really tells us about the behavior of inflation relative to slack in a world of very high resource utilization. I’ll close with a word on market conditions.  It has seemed likely that, although there is a high degree of froth in financial markets, it could decline as the policy normalization process gets going in earnest, and I think there are signs that that may be happening.  Since mid-August, markets seem to be getting more attuned to the coming rate increases—notably, an increase in longer-term yields.  Leveraged finance markets seem to be in better balance.  Overall, it seems to   me, markets are leaning in and listening, and will be reacting to things like the new SEP, and I regard that development as healthy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 233.
   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a question about market expectations as we release the statement.  There are two things that will be going on.  One, there’s a whole bunch of people that now seem to be chattering about us changing “considerable time” at this meeting.  Just in the last week or so that seems to be much more in play.  And, two, what are the expectations about the principles being released at this meeting.  If we release the principles and don’t change the “considerable time” language in the statement, if we go with alternative B, what do we think the market reaction is going to be.  I think it would be useful to talk about that a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their question and discussing two different topics related to market expectations.


Passage number 234.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Simon and I have talked a little bit about this.  I think, as I suggested in my briefing, that it may be kind of a wash, but there’s a lot of uncertainty around that.  As you say, I think the market view on the forward guidance shifted, so that perhaps people built in about one-half probability of a change in the forward guidance at this meeting.  That may have moved some this morning.  I gather there was a Jon Hilsenrath interview or something in which he said maybe that wasn’t going to happen.  It has been very dynamic over the past maybe five or six days, and I think it’s a little hard to know exactly where we are, but certainly that probability is considerably larger than we thought, say, at the time of the Tealbook. On the other hand, I’ve seen only a few market participants thinking that the normalization principles are going to come out at this meeting.  We said “later this year.”  I think a lot of people read that as probably late this year, and so bringing them out now will probably be seen as some news—that we’re clearing the decks, maybe a little bit more than people thought, to actually begin to raise rates.  I also think we’re making a somewhat bigger deal of the normalization principles.  In June 2011, the normalization principles came out in the minutes, and Chairman Bernanke talked about them in his press conference remarks.  Now we’re putting   out a document, and that might dial up the market reaction a little bit.  As I said in my briefing, I think the SEP is a factor as well.  The federal funds rate dots have moved up a little bit—not a whole lot, but an eighth of a percentage point in 2015 and three-eighths in 2016—and people will note that, and that will be a little bit hawkish.  The mix is very hard to get right here in terms of what the overall reaction will be, but if I had to guess, I’d guess it’s just a little bit to the upside, but that depends on where people shake out on the expectations on the forward guidance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any evident contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing different views and uncertainties surrounding the market reactions and expectations of the Federal Reserve's forward guidance and normalization principles.


Passage number 235.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess the one thing I would say from my perspective is, if the principles come out, some people are going to say, “Oh, okay.  That’s why they didn’t change “considerable time,” because they really wanted to emphasize the principles.”  That will be a way, ex post, for all the people that were saying that we’re going to change the “considerable time” language to rationalize.  A lot of those people will say, “Oh, this is why I was wrong, because they really wanted to bring the principles out.”  It probably will minimize the effect of that surprise if there will be a little bit of a surprise—on both sides.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the potential reaction of people to the release of certain principles.


Passage number 236.
 MR. POTTER.  What did you mean by “upside,” slightly less accommodative or more accommodative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 237.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Slightly less accommodative.  Rates would move up a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that rates would move up slightly.


Passage number 238.
 MR. POTTER.  That’s certainly possible.  The SEP is a little bit firmer than the expectations.  They’re going to have to absorb the target range, the midpoint, the eighths.  They might view that, if they try to map it back to their previous version, as being a little bit firmer, or they might want to add eighths to the SEP that they see as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the possibility of the SEP (Summary of Economic Projections) being a little firmer than expected and the need to absorb certain target ranges.


Passage number 239.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The answer is "No."


Passage number 240.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 241.
   MR. FISHER.  I just want to make a comment about the normalization principles because I don’t disagree with Bill, even though I don’t agree with the statement of this lengthy period as stated in alternative B.  The way I interpret the normalization principles—and I’m not just saying this to flatter the Chair—is that they show that she has a firm hand on the wheel, that she’s exerting leadership.  I think that’s a positive.  Now, regardless of what we decide on alternative B, I think they are going to be positively interpreted.  That’s just my sense, and I think it’s an important thing to do, and I don’t think the fact that no one is expecting it throws us off at all.  In fact, I like that.  I think it’s a plus, not a negative.  I just wanted to make that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker starts by acknowledging that they do not disagree with Bill's viewpoint on the normalization principles, but they have a different opinion on a specific part of alternative B. However, overall, the speaker supports the Chair's leadership and believes that the normalization principles will be positively interpreted regardless of the decision on alternative B. They express their appreciation for the lack of expectations and see it as a positive aspect.


Passage number 242.
 MR. POTTER.  It’s just that there are a few people expecting more clarification.  They’re not expecting this particular format because it’s one that we didn’t use before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is simply stating that some people are expecting more clarification and they were not expecting the current format being used. There are no opposing viewpoints or arguments presented.


Passage number 243.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, but, again, it shows a firm hand on the wheel and a clarification, and I think that’s a plus.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and stating that it is a positive thing.


Passage number 244.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Don’t get me wrong.  I think it’s great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker mentions that they think something is great, without expressing any opposing viewpoint or disagreement with someone else's perspective.


Passage number 245.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think we all think it’s great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement. The speaker expresses a positive opinion that everyone agrees with.


Passage number 246.
 MR. FISHER.  It’s unanimous.  It’s great. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It shows agreement between Mr. Fisher and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 247.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I’m just puzzling over this thing in the lower-right-hand corner of the first page.  We’ve got a new variation on the dot pictures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is simply expressing confusion or curiosity about something he is observing.


Passage number 248.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. The fact that someone says "yes" does not necessarily imply contention or disagreement.


Passage number 249.
 MR. LACKER.  Fascinating, the pattern in there.  It looks like a little football formation.  [Laughter]  For each one of us, this is the shortfall in the year that that person gets within 0.2 percentage point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is making an observation and commenting on the pattern they see in the data, which creates a light-hearted atmosphere indicated by the laughter.


Passage number 250.
   MR. ENGLISH.  It’s both the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, within 0.2 percentage point of their longer-run level and what the funds rate is at that time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that the factors to consider are the unemployment rate and inflation rate, as well as the funds rate at that time.


Passage number 251.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  I think this is about the last sentence in the statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The response simply indicates that the last sentence in the statement is the subject of discussion without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 252.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The answer is no. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 253.
 MR. LACKER.  The statement says, “The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target . . .”  This seems relevant to whether the Committee anticipates that when employment and inflation near mandate-consistent levels, the target funds rate will be . . . , not how long it will be after that.  Do you see what I’m saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of opinion or interpretation by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 254.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Yes, absolutely.  For those who are 1½ percentage points, 2 percentage points, even 3 percentage points, it’s just going to take a while.  The “some time” is just going to take a while.  That was our thinking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and emphasizing that it will take some time for certain individuals to reach a certain percentage points.


Passage number 255.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Unless you think they’re going to move 150 basis points in one go. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a statement and the response from President Bullard is not contradicting or arguing against it.


Passage number 256.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just wanted to follow up on this.  When we did ours, we explicitly did it so that when we were converging to the steady state, we were right at the longer-run federal funds rate.  In some sense, this is mischaracterizing whatever we did.  I’m not sure what’s in this, exactly.  We also have overshooting, and when you come back the first time, that isn’t the final convergence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing additional information and clarifying the process they followed.


Passage number 257.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Yes, so we would have picked, I think, the first time you got within 0.2 percentage point of the longer-run levels of inflation and unemployment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. English is simply expressing his opinion about when they would have made a certain decision.


Passage number 258.
   MR. BULLARD.  Right.  But to us, that was part of the oscillatory dynamics that would ultimately converge to the steady state, and once we converge to the steady state, then we’d say, “No, we want to be at the normal federal funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing a process that they believe will lead to a steady state and expresses a desire to remain at the normal federal funds rate once that state is reached.


Passage number 259.
” MR. ENGLISH.  So I agree.  In that case, if we had picked the second time you got there, the rate would have been higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English agrees with the statement presented.


Passage number 260.
 MR. BULLARD.  The only other thing about this is the eighths.  Do eighths count in this.  Is that an issue here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question posed by Mr. Bullard about whether or not eighths count in a certain situation.


Passage number 261.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, there are some eighths in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are some eighths in there.


Passage number 262.
 MR. ENGLISH.  It is whatever you reported for that year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a straightforward statement without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 263.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, we’re reporting eighths now because of the ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. No disagreement or contention is present in this passage. The statement is a straightforward explanation of why eighths are being reported.


Passage number 264.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as Mr. English simply affirms that something is correct.


Passage number 265.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The point is that the mass of the dots are well away from zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply stating a fact about the mass of the dots being well away from zero.


Passage number 266.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Yes, that’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply agrees with a previous statement.


Passage number 267.
 MR. POTTER.  The point is that people don’t report the longer-run normal as a range for this report. CHAIR YELLEN.  Correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Potter makes a statement about how people don't report the longer-run normal as a range for a certain report. Chair Yellen agrees with Mr. Potter's point and confirms its correctness. There is no contention or disagreement between the two.


Passage number 268.
 MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up, Madam Chair.  My sense of the discussion we had, what I was hearing from the Desk, was not that they thought it was going to be something like one year later than when we got to the target—in the sense that the forward curve is lower than the SEP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is merely stating Mr. Lacker's understanding of the discussion and what he heard from the Desk.


Passage number 269.
 MR. POTTER.  Paragraph 6 is focused on the longer-run rate.  Then there’s other commentary about what that longer-run rate is going to be.  So you have two things going on:the fact that you might be below that longer-run rate for some time, and then downward revisions of what that longer-run normal rate would be.  That’s in the SEP over the last year.  It’s in the market as well.  It seems that some of the views that it’s zero would not be consistent with the SEP that’s going to be produced, and people will see that in 2017.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply describing two different aspects of the longer-run rate and noting that there have been downward revisions of this rate in the SEP and market. It does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 270.
 MR. LACKER.  All right. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the names of two individuals without providing any context or details of their conversation.


Passage number 271.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.  I just have a quick comment on page 1 on the chart about the SEP unemployment rate and its path since September 2012.  Some of this decline, I think, is due to unanticipated declines in the labor force participation rate, and one way to look at that is to look at the staff forecast, at least, for the employment-to-population ratio in September 2012 and for the end of this year and compare that with where we’re now expecting to be.  I’m happy to report that the employment-to-population ratio we’re going to arrive at is higher than we anticipated in September 2012, but I don’t think it’s as rosy a picture as one would see from just looking at the unemployment rate.  My recollection is maybe a couple of tenths higher than what we anticipated.  There has been improvement.  I might not go as far as to say “substantial,” but there has been improvement. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions or comments.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 272.
 MS. BRAINARD.  I just want to go back to this “considerable time” question.  It’s clearly out there in the market that this language is going to go.  However, if you actually look at the SEP submissions and you look at the actual sentence, it will remain extremely accurate to the day that we lift off.  In a sense, it’s not clear why that sentence would ever need to change, right.  If you think we’re ending asset purchases in October and you think “considerable time” means about six months, and if you look at the SEP and it says we’re going to lift off in June, I think   there’s a little bit of a puzzle of how we’ve allowed the markets to think that that language necessarily needs to change at all.  Right now if you look at it literally, it does say October and June, basically.  That’s just a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker is questioning why the language of "considerable time" needs to change, while implying that the markets may have jumped to conclusions about its meaning. The speaker's statement implies disagreement with the idea that the language needs to be altered.


Passage number 273.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I ask a question of Governor Brainard.  You’re saying, if you just kept that language in there, you would date from the end of the asset purchases, and as you got to March of next year, it would almost be not important anymore, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification on a statement made by Governor Brainard.


Passage number 274.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Well, it’s a question, really.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is a question being asked.


Passage number 275.
 MR. POTTER.  I think your point was, now people expect a change.  Even though you could leave it in, it’s difficult to leave it in, because it will mean something different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply discussing the difficulty of leaving something in when it will have a different meaning.


Passage number 276.
 MS. BRAINARD.  The question is, can we change expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply poses a question without introducing conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 277.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I’m not sure if I’m interpreting you exactly correctly, but let’s say we did change and made it “some time” after the asset purchase program ends instead of “a considerable time.”  I think that would arguably move expectations up too much.  My read of your SEP contributions was the center of the distribution is in the second quarter of next year, not necessarily June, but still six months or something like that after the end of the purchase program.  I think moving to “some time” would be read as carrying a lot of freight, and would move things up to just a few months after the end of the purchase program in October.  It would be March or maybe even December, and that’s probably earlier than where the center of the Committee is right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. English, expresses his uncertainty about the interpretation and potential change of using "some time" instead of "a considerable time" after the asset purchase program ends. He argues that such a change could potentially move expectations up too much, contrary to the earlier statements made by another person (not mentioned in the passage) about the timing of the end of the purchase program. Therefore, there is disagreement between Mr. English's interpretation and the previous statements made.


Passage number 278.
 MS. BRAINARD.  I agree completely that any change in that language will probably pull forward market movements in the rates.  Again, the question is just, really, isn’t that sentence   entirely descriptive of our views, and won’t it remain entirely descriptive unless, of course, our views about when liftoff happens change. CHAIR YELLEN.  If we thought June, it remains fine now.  It would remain fine in October because it still would say six months or more before we would lift off.  If we changed it in October to just “considerable time,” and the market thought that means six months, at least six months, it’s still fine if we think June, but as we get closer to June, we have to change it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about the market reactions to changes in language regarding interest rate liftoff. The speakers are discussing different scenarios and the potential impact on market expectations.


Passage number 279.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We were talking earlier, and Governor Powell, you might want to put forward your idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Governor Powell may want to present their idea, implying a normal conversation without any conflicts or contradicting opinions.


Passage number 280.
 MR. POWELL.  An alternative—and we’ve actually discussed this:  If you leave the reference to the end of the asset purchase program, then you have something with a six-month shelf life that expires in six months.  If you take the reference out and it just says “considerable time,” then it’s always—every time you open your mouth and say “considerable time”—six months from that moment, right. CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are discussing a possible alternative and agreeing on how it would work.


Passage number 281.
 MR. POWELL.  I have to say, I increasingly find some attraction in the first formulation, because if you leave in the reference to the end of the asset purchase program, then it says six months from the end of October, which means around the end of April, and then you don’t have to change.  The moment when you try to change that language is very fraught and could bring on a sudden tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 282.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  You just keep the language “considerable time” after the October 2014 meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states Mr. Kocherlakota's statement regarding the use of the phrase "considerable time" after the October 2014 meeting.


Passage number 283.
 MR. POWELL.  Right, and you let time do its work. CHAIR YELLEN.  What do you do two months before you intend to raise rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 284.
   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Then you do a real rewrite of the statement to signal that. CHAIR YELLEN.  On the day you change it, without any warning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply describes a process of rewriting a statement without any warning.


Passage number 285.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  No, no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the following passage because it does not present conflicting ideas, opinions, or arguments.


Passage number 286.
 MR. POWELL.  You’d probably change it at the March meeting, because you’re pretty sure at that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement by MR. POWELL is simply stating a belief or prediction about changing something at a future meeting.


Passage number 287.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Exactly.  If June is your time frame.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement of agreement or clarification.


Passage number 288.
 MR. TARULLO.  Madam Chair, my suspicion is, you don’t really want to get heavily into this issue right now.  It’s the wise thing to not do.  Just to be clear, though, what Vice Chairman Dudley and Governors Brainard and Powell and I have all been alluding to is the notion of changing the tense of the verbs, as it were, in the current statement rather than get into changing the adjectives in the sentence, and we can discuss that at a later time, but that’s really the distinction. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Well, we perhaps will discuss this a little more.  Was there a two-hander somewhere.  Okay.  Everybody has been recognized.  I think we can—what do we get to have, a beer, a martini, a glass of champagne.  Your choice.  [Laughter]  We begin at nine o’clock tomorrow morning. [Meeting recessed]  September 17 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  We are going to start with an update from David on this morning’s CPI reading.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 289.
 MR. WILCOX8.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As you, I’m sure, can appreciate, we’ve only had the briefest of glances at the data.  The CPI came in a little weaker than we had been expecting.  The miss to one digit, as you can see on the table that is in your place, rounds to 0.2 percentage point.  To two digits, it’s about 15 basis points.  We think that a very large drop in airfares accounted for somewhere between a third and a half of that.  The PCE price index doesn’t pick up the CPI measure of airfares.  Instead, it uses the PPI measure of airfares, so we think that a significant portion of the forecast miss won’t, in fact, translate into a lower PCE price index.  But beyond that, it does look like there were some softer readings across a fairly wide range of categories.  Yesterday we got the PPI, and the news there was just a little stronger than we had expected.  Medical care prices are relevant for the PCE index, and. as I mentioned, the airfares component of the PPI is relevant.  On balance, my guess is that we are a little to the soft side.  I expect to get a little more precise reading later on this morning, as the meeting is in progress, about how this translates. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Any questions for David.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wilcox mentions that the CPI came in weaker than expected, but also points out that the PCE price index may not be affected by this miss. This indicates a difference in opinion or uncertainty about how the data will translate into the PCE price index.


Passage number 290.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  May I ask a question. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, of course.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer asks a question and Chair Yellen allows him to proceed.


Passage number 291.
 MR. FISCHER.  What does “stronger” mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply presents a question asked by Mr. Fischer.


Passage number 292.
 MR. WILCOX.  Higher.  Larger.  More positive.  To the right on the real line.  [Laughter]  8 The materials used by Mr. Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 8).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a description of Mr. Wilcox's materials and includes a note of laughter, which suggests a lighthearted or humorous tone.


Passage number 293.
   MR. FISCHER.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I think we are ready to begin our policy round, and we will start with President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the conversation is transitioning to start a policy round with President Lockhart.


Passage number 294.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B this morning and the statement as is.  Regarding the statement, I favor holding to the characterization of the labor market in paragraph 1 that emphasizes “significant underutilization of labor resources.” Bill English pointed out yesterday that an important question for this meeting—and, in my view, for the coming meetings—will be what to do with the “considerable time” language in paragraph 5.  I do not support removing or changing the “considerable time” language at this meeting, and my instinct is that we should be very cautious about when and why to drop this particular phrase.  The consensus across this Committee on the timing of liftoff seems to be sometime in 2015, and in 2015 the timing ranges from the first quarter to the second half.  In my SEP forecast, I assumed liftoff in the third quarter.  In the absence of a materially different inflation outlook, and in the absence of a clear and present danger of destructive financial instability, I would rather err on the side of being a little late rather than too early.  In my thinking, exercising patience would be insurance against weakening momentum or backsliding in terms of economic growth and employment gains.  Like it or not, financial markets are likely to put a six-month horizon on the dating of liftoff from our decision to drop “considerable.”  If we choose not to disabuse the public of this interpretation, then I expect to be opposed to dropping “considerable” when asset purchases end in October.  I believe divesting of “considerable” in October would cause expectations to firm around a liftoff date that is earlier than my current comfort zone.   Paragraph 5, in my thinking, could be adjusted at the next meeting by simply deleting “after the asset purchase program ends.”  Of course, we might be able to change understanding of what dropping “considerable” means through public commentary, especially the Chair’s.  But my sense of discussions in the press and among commentators is that the decision to drop “considerable” may have real value as a signaling device that can provide some amount of precision to our guidance without boxing the Committee into quantitative conditionality, as in alternative A.  I am wary of laying down a more precise quantitative marker, as in alternative A, if only because our earlier attempt at quantitative economic conditionality didn’t work out so well. I expect the communication challenges ahead to be formidable.  I think many of us are frustrated with the SEP dots as a Committee communications vehicle.  I would support revisiting how this device might be improved.  I also think we might resume the practice of discussing and taking straw votes on messages the Chair might convey in press conferences and other communications.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses his support for alternative B and the statement as is, and also shares his thoughts and preferences regarding the timing of liftoff and the use of certain phrases. However, he does not directly disagree with any other member or express opposition to their views.


Passage number 295.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  As I stated yesterday, current conditions require a patient monetary policy.  The disappointing August employment report highlights why we need to be attentive to incoming data.  We should not be too confident that our forecast will become reality.  If we only reach full employment in the second half of 2016, with inflation still below 2 percent, as in my forecast, then waiting to raise rates until the second half of next year seems appropriate.   This meeting and press conference should be focused on exit principles.  Like President Lockhart, I would like to comment on communications challenges for future meetings.  I have several points that I’d like to make on communications. One, once we have lifted off, I think we should no longer provide time-dependent language as forward guidance.  At the October meeting, we will, by necessity, need to make significant changes to the statement, because we will be ending the purchase program.  We should use the October meeting to map out language that will be used up to and after liftoff.  If incoming data is consistent with the current Tealbook forecast, I would prefer that we then state that there has been no change in the expected liftoff date, but that we plan to no longer use time-dependent guidance.  If the Committee instead decides to keep the “considerable time” language in October and only modify the tense thereafter, as was suggested yesterday afternoon, we could still make the guidance more data dependent.  For example, we could change the language “it likely will be appropriate,” which introduces the “considerable time” language, to something more conditional on economic data. My final comment is that it may be worth considering in the subcommittee on communications whether we adequately capture uncertainty in our SEP forecasts.  Ideally, we would move from providing point estimates to providing distributions, somewhat similar to the way the Survey of Professional Forecasters captures the distribution of key variables.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and providing their opinion on monetary policy and communication strategies.


Passage number 296.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  At the last meeting, I mentioned I was very reluctant to support alternative B, and I supported it really out of respect for your then-recent testimony before the Congress.  If you remember, we had a discussion about the wording, and I   thought it was important to follow through.  And yet at the same time, I did provide notice that I was doing so with great reluctance. With regard to the current statement, on the plus side, paragraph 4 of alternative B does include specific forward guidance by stating that we will end our asset purchases at the next meeting.  You know I am in favor of that.  On net, listening to what people are saying at the table and looking at the numbers, the data have improved somewhat in the intermeeting period, and yet the language has not changed in the statement.  So I cannot support alternative B, Madam Chair. A little regression here—in 1944, Father Divine gave a brilliant sermon.  He talked about accentuating the positive and eliminating the negative.  And then—I think I mentioned this a few meetings ago—Johnny Mercer wrote a great song in 1944, and that was the name of it.  I think we tend too much here to accentuate the negative and, if not eliminating, we are certainly de-emphasizing the positive. I think we have had continuous strengthening of the real economy.  I think there is an improved outlook for labor utilization, and—I’m going to state this carefully—for general price stability.  I take note of this morning’s numbers.  And I continue to be worried about signs of financial market excess, which I believe—if we’re not careful, and we keep the phraseology “significant underutilization of labor resources” and “considerable time”—will just exacerbate those negative influences. So, Madam Chair, with great reluctance—and I signaled this to you earlier—I will not support alternative B.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is primarily expressing the speaker's thoughts and concerns about alternative B and the current statement.


Passage number 297.
   MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot determine


Passage number 298.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B today.  I support indicating in the statement that the asset purchase program will end in October, if incoming information is consistent with the outlook.  In fact, I think we could reduce any residual ambiguity and say that the Committee “will end” rather than “will likely end” the program, because we already have the caveat that this will be dependent on incoming information being broadly consistent with the outlook. As was true last time, I continue to think that the tone of the first paragraph understates the improvement seen in the economy.  Perhaps because it focuses on describing changes over the intermeeting period, the paragraph is sometimes forced to base that description on very little new data.  So while factually correct, changes in the description can, at times, send the wrong message.  Last time I was uncomfortable with introducing language saying there was “significant underutilization of labor resources” because I felt it suggested we were more concerned about labor market developments than we were in June or earlier in the year.  This time, my concern is with the language and the characterization of inflation.  Our last statement indicated that inflation had “moved somewhat closer” to our goal.  The new language is that inflation has been “running somewhat below” our goal.  While that is true, it was also true last time.  So the change might be viewed as a signal that we have renewed or additional concerns about the inflation outlook.  Today’s CPI report notwithstanding, I don’t think that our view of inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent has changed since last time.  Year-over-year PCE inflation is little changed since our last meeting, and it has been fairly stable, running slightly above 1½ percent since April.  My preference would have been to use the language in alternative C or to keep the language as it was in July but to clarify the timing, as we do in paragraph 2.  If we indicate in the first paragraph   that inflation has moved somewhat closer to the Committee’s goal since the start of the year, this helps provide a rationale for our statement in paragraph 2 that we believe the risk of persistent low inflation has diminished since early this year. I also remain concerned with our forward guidance on the federal funds rate.  We are announcing that the asset purchase program is likely to end next month.  Rate increases are anticipated sometime next year, and the timing of liftoff has been moving closer than where it was expected to be earlier this year.  In my view, the forward guidance that liftoff will be a “considerable time after the asset purchase program ends” is nearly obsolete.  And the description in paragraph 6 that the Committee anticipates below-normal policy rates, even after we reach our dual-mandate goals, may also need to be rethought. I was hoping that we could make a change in guidance today as part of a package of communications at this meeting, including the significant release of the normalization principles, the SEP, and the press conference.  But we should not make such changes on the fly, so I accept that today is not the day.  I do hope that such a change can remain part of the discussion for October, when the asset purchase program presumably will end.  We have said we won’t delay needed changes in policy to press conference meetings, and this might be a test case.  In my projection, “appropriate monetary policy” entails a liftoff in the first quarter of next year.  I would like our forward guidance to give us the flexibility to do that if it turns out to be necessary.  So waiting until December to change the forward guidance is problematic for me. Now, exactly how to change the forward guidance is a challenge, and I expect there are diverse views around the table.  In fact, we have heard some of them today.  In the recession and early stages of the recovery, forward guidance was a tool of monetary policy used to add accommodation.  But as we move toward normalization, I view forward guidance more as a   communications and transparency device rather than as a policy tool per se.  In reformulating the forward guidance over the medium run, I believe we should aim to remove the focus from the date of a policy change to the conditions we systematically look at in determining the actual and projected level and speed of progress of the economy toward our goals.  Indeed, we should put more emphasis on that first line in paragraph 5 and surround it with more context.  Reaching a consensus on this type of guidance will not be easy to do before liftoff, I suspect, but I do think it is something we should strive for.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. MS. Mester is expressing her own views and preferences, but she is not arguing or disagreeing with anyone else.


Passage number 299.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m going to make some general comments, and then I’ll get to specific comments on today’s decision. I am increasingly concerned about the path of tightening contemplated by the Committee.  I think there’s a rising risk that we will be too late, too slow, and not state contingent enough.  Raising policy interest rates is the hardest job of a central bank.  For this task ahead, I think we need to have all hands on deck.  We need to be prepared to be more opportunistic than currently contemplated.  We need to be able to take good data and use it to our advantage.  In my opinion, there will be positive feedback to the economy if we can acknowledge success in the economy and financial markets see that as a rationale for the higher interest rates that are occurring.  I think it means being quite a bit more nimble than the current Committee discussion envisions. The tightening cycle from 2004 to 2006 was extremely mechanical.  It ended badly in a global macroeconomic disaster.  Housing prices rose at their most rapid pace during the period of policy tightening.  I am increasingly concerned that something similar could occur during this cycle.  Once we begin the tightening cycle, policy will still be exceptionally easy for many years.   I recommend the following:  Number one, more explicit attempts to make policy more state dependent than currently contemplated.  Number two, schedule a press conference after each meeting to allow the Committee to make adjustments to policy when the data are sufficiently favorable.  Number three, de-emphasize labor market rhetoric relative to what it has been over the last few years.  The labor market has improved substantially, as we will acknowledge at our next meeting when we end asset purchases.  I expect continued labor market improvement even as we adjust interest rates.  I think we have made a lot of progress in the labor market.  We will continue to make progress even as we go through the tightening cycle.  Number four, we should emphasize that a key risk is that we have experienced two major asset market bubbles in two decades and that we do not wish to encourage a third to develop over the next two to three years with unknown consequences for the United States and for the global economy.  Number five, we should communicate to financial markets that we may have to be more nimble and flexible than we were from 2004 to 2006. I’ll make some comments now on today’s policy choices.  I can support alternative B, but I think we may want to think about some changes to this statement either today or at future meetings.  In paragraph 1, we say, “Economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.”  Real GDP tracking for the second quarter is running at 4.6 or 4.7 percent.  Tracking estimates for the third quarter are running at about 3.5 percent.  So I thought maybe we could replace “moderate” with “blistering.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by one person expressing their concerns and recommendations.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It appears to be a light-hearted moment with laughter, followed by a question about China.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 301.
 MR. BULLARD.  We’re catching up to them.  In the first paragraph, we have “significant underutilization of labor resources.”  I think this should simply be “underutilization of labor resources,” without the “significant” qualifier; I thought that, last time.  At the next   meeting we are going to end QE, saying that there’s been significant progress in labor markets.  I think it’s a little bit awkward to then turn around and say there’s “significant underutilization of labor resources.”  So we’ve made a lot of progress.  In my mind, we would use the word “significant” when unemployment was at 8 percent or other indicators were otherwise extremely far from normal, but everything has come closer to normal—not all the way, but closer to normal.  I think we should just say “there remains underutilization of labor resources.” In the first paragraph, we also continue to say “fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”  The discussion yesterday indicated that I think that’s factually correct but increasingly questionable as something to put in this first paragraph.  Maybe we should think about striking that at some point.  It sounds like the staff estimates are down to 0.1 percentage point or something like that.  I’m not sure it’s reasonable to have that kind of an empirical finding elevated to something that the Committee puts in a policy statement. In paragraph 5, we say “A highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.”  I question whether we should say “highly accommodative.”  This is something we said when QE was at its very peak, and we were announcing QE plus a zero-interest-rate policy plus continued forward guidance.  Now we’re pulling back on the QE policy.  The forward guidance is not nearly as strong as it was.  Is it really the same policy that we had when we first put this language in.  I think just “accommodative stance of monetary policy” remains appropriate.  And certainly, as long as the policy rate is below its neutral level, we would be saying something like that, but I question whether we can maintain the word “highly” if we’re pulling back on other elements of our policy. In paragraph 5, I would switch “considerable time” after QE ends to “some time”—not at this meeting, but at the October meeting—to give us more optionality for what we’re going to   need to do in coming meetings.  Again, I would be much more opportunistic than what I think the Committee is envisioning here.  If we get some good data, then we should go ahead and make a move.  I’m not expecting to mechanically go up for 16 meetings in a row.  I do not think that is optimal policy.  I think when we have a chance to react to data, we want to take it.  When the data are not so strong, we might want to pause.  I think if we could get the Committee to behave in that manner, it would be a better policy for the U.S. economy.  So I’d be willing to switch to “some time” in October.  President Plosser has suggested an even better change to paragraph 5, which is to eliminate the last sentence and make the entire paragraph dependent on the state of the economy.  The Committee will make a judgment about when to act.  I think a good dynamic for the Committee would be to get into a rhythm of, “We’ve got some good data, our confidence has increased a little bit, we’re willing to raise rates a little bit in response to that,” as opposed to the very mechanical episode from 2004 to 2006.  Removing that last sentence completely would remove the calendar-based policy altogether in favor of a state-dependent policy.  That would probably be a good move for the Committee to make.  That completes my comments for today.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, disagrees with the use of the word "significant" in describing the underutilization of labor resources. He also questions the use of the phrase "fiscal policy is restraining economic growth" and the use of "highly accommodative" to describe the stance of monetary policy. Additionally, Mr. Bullard suggests changing the statement about "considerable time" to "some time" and removing the last sentence of paragraph 5 to make the policy more state-dependent.


Passage number 302.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B in terms of a further reduction in asset purchases with an eye toward ending these purchases at the October meeting.  Bringing the asset purchase program to a close will fulfill the Committee’s stated goal of achieving substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and, assuming no material adverse shifts in the economy, it will offer an opportunity for us to reconsider the language in our statement at our next meeting. I remain concerned about keeping near-zero rates for a considerable time in the face of continued and meaningful progress in the economy, an SEP that shows pushing the unemployment rate below levels consistent with full employment in many of our forecasts, and several policy prescriptions that are now signaling higher rates.  For these reasons, I support moving away from explicit forward guidance in the statement and instead prefer to let other mechanisms, including the SEP, provide such guidance.  The SEP not only provides the general trajectory of rates, but should reflect the data-dependent nature of our policy as well as a measure of healthy uncertainty regarding the path.  Thank you.   CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MS. GEORGE expresses her support for alternative B and suggests ending asset purchases at the October meeting. She also states her concern about keeping near-zero rates for a long time and suggests moving away from explicit forward guidance in the statement. However, there is no clear disagreement or contention with any other specific viewpoint.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 303.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the general path we are on, embodied in alternative B.  I’ll cut to the issues of the day here.  I was among those who did not favor the use of the word “significant” regarding underutilization of labor resources at the last meeting, and, for the record, I remain in that camp.  I understand no change seems likely at this meeting, but I would like to make one observation about that language.  It doesn’t have to take a significant improvement in labor market underutilization to warrant dropping the word “significant” about labor market utilization.  There is a range of values of labor market indicators that qualify as “significant underutilization,” and there is a range for which underutilization without the word “significant” would be more appropriate, and the boundary between those two might not involve a significant change in labor market utilization.  So I think that’s too high a standard for dropping the word “significant.” I agree with President Mester’s insights about the inflation language in paragraph 1, and I think President Kocherlakota’s suggestion is constructive in that regard. I came into this meeting prepared to support removing “considerable time,” depending, of course, on what I heard from my colleagues in the discussion around the table.  I was persuaded by President Plosser at the last meeting that, on net, over the last several quarters, our forward guidance has been less data dependent than we would have expected, had we thought about the likelihood of the outcomes that we’ve actually seen.  That’s why I favored dropping it as soon as we could in order to preserve the flexibility that I think we’re going to need as we go forward.  I do not think it would add materially to the hawkishness of the general announcement today if we were to add it, given the normalization principles announcement as well, but I’d support working in the intermeeting period very hard and very creatively to craft a successor formulation to this.   While we’re at it, if you look at the statement, a variety of communications have accreted.  This might be a good opportunity to clean house, go through the closets of the statement, and take out the things or reformulate things that have built up over time.  We are going to be dropping a whole paragraph on guidance about the asset purchase program.  So it is a great opportunity, I think, to take a fresh look at the whole statement. I’m in the camp of wanting to avoid a mechanical path like we began in 2004.  And I tend to agree with President Bullard that, going at ¼ percentage point per meeting, it would have been an accident if we had gotten through at exactly the right rate without changing the schedule of how many meetings we were doing per year.  Arguably, in hindsight, we got it too low, and I don’t say that on the basis of housing developments, but just on the basis of the inflation rate having run at about 3 percent for four years straight.  I think that’s another good reason to take a look at things and to preserve flexibility. About guidance after liftoff, I think this is going to be kind of problematic to back away from.  When we put something forward-looking in the statement, part of our checklist should be, at what meeting can you envision something happening between the two meetings that would cause you to change that.  And it’s hard to picture.  I have a hard time envisioning what would cause us to drop that in between two meetings and being able to answer the question:  Why do you drop that now.  So I think we should be really careful about introducing guidance like that. On the Heisenberg principle, I think a more parsimonious theory is that we succumb to the temptation to take our point forecasts too seriously.  The unemployment rate came in within the confidence bounds we would have put around our point forecasts a year or two ago, and so maybe we just didn’t think carefully about what we wanted to have happen in that instance.   A related observation I’d make is that, throughout this recovery, there’s been this temptation to think of real activity, and the evolution of real activity, as driven by kind of a univariate, unidimensional object—to think of it as up or down or some sort of latent variable.  But we’ve seen disappointment on the output side and we’ve been surprised on the positive side on the labor market, and productivity obviously intermediates that.  I think we need to be careful to take into account the possibility of different outcomes on different sides of the equation. Now, last year I think we fuzzed this up in communications, and I think it’s tempting to do that.  But we fuzzed it up to the extent that we added in a pickup in economic growth at times last year in our communications, particularly in the press conferences, in a way that wrapped that into labor market conditions.  And we could face this challenge if productivity continues to disappoint.  I think focusing more forcefully and more narrowly on the labor market is the right path to go down.  I think the economics point in that direction as well.  So I’d urge that in our communications as we go forward.  Thank you.  Those are my comments, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. While the speaker generally supports the direction they are heading in, they express disagreement with certain aspects such as the use of the word "significant" and the timing of removing "considerable time." They also suggest taking a fresh look at the whole statement and express concern about introducing certain types of guidance.


Passage number 304.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks very much, Madam Chair.  I agree with the decision and with the statement, and, like most people, I want to talk a little bit about what comes next. I would like to start by noting that while we haven’t changed our language, it seems that the implied timing or estimates of the date of liftoff have changed.  The staff forecast has it in the second quarter of 2015, and the markets seem to have moved slightly in that direction.  Now, it’s pretty clear why I and most people support not shifting the language in such a way as to indicate this month that the decision could be made earlier than the current formulation, combined with market developments, indicates and the dynamics that produces.  Why not.  Well, economic growth has been weak recently.  The inflation rate hasn’t risen.  If anything, it has declined.  It’s   likely to remain below target as long as wages and the price of energy remain contained.  Economic growth hasn’t picked up, and all of those factors indicate there’s no hurry. But I’d like to get to the point of the discussion.  The discussion is about normalization, and I want to raise questions about what is normal.  Our monetary policy is very far from normal, and I hope also very far from what will be the “new normal.”  We all recognize we have to normalize.  We’re recognizing that by putting out a statement to that effect today, and so that’s not an issue at all.  It’s clear that Taylor rules or any other monetary policy analysis based on the past would say that the interest rate is too low, and that’s understandable.  We’re coming out of a very deep recession, and the zero interest rate was part of the treatment. There’s also the problem of raising the rate and later having to reduce it.  That’s a serious problem, but I’ve been a bit surprised in this discussion to hear that we have the opposite problem as well, that we might raise it and keep on raising it mechanically until it has gone higher than we would like it to be.  I hope we’ve learned the lesson from the 1990s and from 2003 onward that you have to think about how much you raise the interest rate and what might happen if you raise it more than you should.  And we probably learned the lesson that the full effects of changes in the interest rate don’t come out immediately.  There are immediate reactions, and I want to talk about one of them. I’ve been listening to the discussion, and I have discussed with colleagues how much notice we have to give to have an “optimal negative impact”—that is, the smallest negative effect—on disruptions in the market as a result of making our announcement.  I’ve heard people say that three months’ notice is enough.  I’m not convinced of that.  I don’t think we’ve discussed that issue very much.  But I think we haven’t considered the effect of the date we start—the forward guidance we give—with respect to what will happen when the markets do   begin to understand that we may be moving within a few months.  We do not want to start with a repeat of the taper tantrum.  My sense is that we need to give a decent amount of notice—which I think is more than three months—to the markets that that is what’s going to happen.  When we change the interest rate, we want to change it in an orderly market environment, and that will mean that we have to have worried a little more than we have so far about things like when we make the announcement and how long it is to the announcement.  And we also need to avoid putting ourselves in the position in which we are virtually bound by our previous statements not to move for the next two or three meetings.  I express these concerns because I want to maintain flexibility in both directions as we move ahead, both the ability not to change the interest rate, on which we’re focusing so far—and I accept the asymmetry that moving too early will be worse than moving too late, but moving too late can also be a mistake, and we don’t want to move either way.  We don’t want to be either too early or too late, taking into account the constraints we put on ourselves.  I think we need to be aware of that as we think next month about how we’re going to change this language and what messages we’re sending. And I support the proposed decision.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a speech by Mr. Fischer expressing his agreement with a decision and discussing his thoughts on the next steps. He raises concerns and offers suggestions, but there is no disagreement or argument with anyone else.


Passage number 305.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I’m happy to support the language as is.  I have some sympathy for the point that Presidents Mester and Kocherlakota made, but this is one for which I would give my proxy to the Chair.  If people are interested in changing that last sentence on inflation, I’d be happy to go along with it. I think, to some degree, the issue here is whether there’s an inconsistency between thinking there’s been a lot of progress and there’s a lot of work that remains.  To recall the   metaphor the Chair used to use when she wasn’t the Chair, looking up at the map of the United States on her road trip from Berkeley to—was it Washington you were going to. CHAIR YELLEN.  New York.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo expresses his support for alternative B and indicates he is willing to go along with any potential changes if others are interested. He also acknowledges that there may be differing perspectives on the progress made and the remaining work, but does not argue against them.


Passage number 306.
 MR. TARULLO.  Oh, Berkeley to New York, never going to Washington along the way.  You know, you can have made it all the way to Ohio without necessarily being at the point when you can take your foot off the gas or certainly when you want to start braking.  And so I don’t think there’s an inconsistency between the notion that there has been a lot of progress and that there is, now in slightly more technical terms, a lot of slack remaining.  That is what I suggested yesterday, and I think that’s what we should be focusing on analytically, not just an expectation of, “Well, if we’ve made a lot of progress, we must be close to the end,” but instead trying to measure when it is that we can fairly think that we’re getting close to the end.  The second point is just to embrace, by reference, the points that Presidents Lockhart and Evans made on risks, although I’m happy to embrace Governor Fischer’s more symmetric concerns about risk as well. Looking forward, for a while I tried to convince myself that we didn’t actually have to change the language even as the LSAPs ended next month, but grammar, syntax, and the English language just worked against that conclusion.  [Laughter]  Something is going to have to be done.  As has already become apparent, I think that there are different approaches that can be taken.  My own sense is that the best way to do this—and I think President Lacker was alluding to this—is just to get started as soon as possible writing down how the statement would look with something that tries to be state contingent, something that tries to use different adjectives, something that, as some of us were mentioning yesterday, freezes the language but then has an additional way to look forward, and then just gaming out what the pluses and minuses of each of those will be.  I’m very glad that no one seemed interested in doing it on the run this morning.   Just to reveal a couple of my own preferences or concerns, I really don’t want the change in language to be de facto liftoff, which is what I’ve been concerned about all along; that instead of an indication that we’re likely to move in X meetings or Y meetings, the market reaction will be, “Okay, if they’re moving in, whatever, X or Y meetings, they’re moving, and this has now changed the game,” and more or less immediately we have a taper-tantrum-squared or cubed.  I don’t know that that would happen, but that has been my overriding concern.  Now, if you’re already prepared to lift off, or you were prepared a year ago to lift off, that presumably wouldn’t be as much of a concern, although I would think that some anticipation in markets without certainty would be desirable.  In crafting these different alternatives, I’ll be looking for a way that gets markets focused more on our shifting assessment of the progress and the remaining slack in the economy, which is something that is not a jump, fit-start, move but instead more gradual, rather than some verbal change that is understood to signal a fundamental change in policy as of that moment. Finally, coming back to something else President Mester said that I thought was a useful point to make.  I’ve noticed in my time here that paragraph 1 seems to be about deltas, just what changed since the last meeting.  And because that that’s what it seems to be about, we sensibly focus on some of these words and phrases.  We have been using, I think, paragraph 3 to give a greater sense of our overall look at the economy and where we think things are going, but particularly as paragraph 3 is going to have a little less salience after October, it might be worthwhile—this may be a job for Governor Fischer’s subcommittee—to think a little bit about whether we want paragraph 1 just to be about or predominantly about deltas or instead to find a way to characterize what we think the general trend is, and then take note of the deltas along the way.  But that is probably not a one-meeting exercise either.  Thank you, Madam Chair.   CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, is discussing his thoughts and suggestions regarding the progress and remaining slack in the economy, as well as the potential changes in language and policy. There is no mention of any opposing viewpoints or disagreements.


Passage number 307.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’ll support alternative B as written, and I have a comment on the two key words.  Starting with the first paragraph, I do think “significant” can come out at a time when we have a credible reason for taking it out, and for me that would be a downtick in the unemployment rate and a good payroll report.  I think even one of those would be plausible, which is what we’ll have potentially at the next meeting, if not, certainly, by December.  So I don’t think that has a lot of market implications. The other thing I’ll talk about is “considerable time,” and I see two general approaches.  One approach is to actually eliminate that time-based aspect of paragraph 5 and replace it with something more state contingent.  I think the problem there is that market participants have really focused in on this as a key signal, and I think changing it in a fundamental way absolutely risks an early and unintentional liftoff—unintentional in some parts. I think it’s useful to go back to how financial market participants process the things we do.  The thing they really care about is when.  They know we’re going to lift off, and I think a typical financial market participant might read our very carefully crafted paragraph 5 and say, “So, you’re saying June, then.”  I think we need to keep that in mind.  The alternative, I think, is to take the tool that we have, which is this language, and evolve it in a way that allows it to become irrelevant over time and lets the development of the economy shine through over time.  And there are a couple of ways to do that.  One is to keep it hooked up to the asset-purchase program and just let it die, and then it will have to be downgraded at some point.  Another is to keep it and drop the reference to the asset purchase program and, again, downgrade it over time.  I think there are choices to be made in that, but I do lean to those kind of ideas as significantly less risky.  It may be purgatory, but I would remind everybody that purgatory is not the downside   case here.  [Laughter]  I would just conclude by saying that a highly desirable feature of this process is that it be as boring as possible.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  We’ll try for that.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing different approaches to the wording of a paragraph and expressing the speaker's preference and concerns about each approach. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 308.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I think developments since the last meeting have validated the approach we took last time of finalizing preparations for normalization and bringing the tapering of asset purchases to an end in October while deferring a definitive commitment on liftoff until we have more consistent evidence of accelerating improvement in the labor market and on inflation moving toward 2 percent. I think several considerations argue for a very high degree of continuity in the key elements of our statement at this meeting.  Most importantly, the data on both inflation and employment have come in somewhat weaker since our last meeting in July, which argues for continuity on our description of economic conditions.  Moreover, I think there are relatively more downside risks to the forecast against which we might want to hold some insurance—in particular, an escalation of geopolitical tensions and a further strengthening of the exchange rate following a very sharp increase during the last intermeeting period. I think it’s important that we all remember that the decision on today’s statement is being taken in the context of other very important actions we’re taking.  Although today’s statement on its own would be viewed as maintaining the status quo, it will be balanced by the publication of the normalization principles, which are very significant, and the release of the Summary of Economic Projections, which will show that the median implied date of liftoff has been moving earlier and that the median path of expected increases has become modestly steeper. Second, I’m among those who believe that there would be a very high cost to reversing course, and because this recovery has proven unusually susceptible in the past to “false dawns,” I   think it would be very wise to wait until we see a more consistent pattern of improvement in employment and inflation before committing to an alteration of course.  Once a tightening cycle is initiated, I think it would damage our credibility enormously to reverse course and return to the zero lower bound, as we’ve seen in other countries.  And it’s worth noting the striking conclusion that was pointed out yesterday:  that primary dealers see a 20 percent chance of returning to the zero lower bound in the next two years and a 30 percent chance of recession.  So for those reasons, I would argue against altering the forward guidance, which in current conditions actually looks very robust.  I actually read that paragraph as a highly conditional paragraph, and you have to put the sentence in the context of the assessment that it explicitly refers to. Another thing I think we need to recall when we talk about state contingency and responding to the data is that market participants are looking not just at our language, but also at the Summary of Economic Projections, and that the data dependence is conveyed in a much more granular form in changes in those projections.  With the Summary of Economic Projections pointing toward a median date of liftoff now in June 2015 and a median federal funds rate of 1.38 percent at the end of 2015, the “considerable time” language anchored to an October asset purchase end date appears to accurately describe where the Committee actually is right now.  I also view it as very significant that market participants appear to have actually pulled forward their expected date of liftoff, which now looks much closer to the median in the Summary of Economic Projections and closer to the Tealbook forecast than we have seen previously. Looking forward, I think it is a good debate to start having today about how that forward guidance might be altered.  I want to associate myself with what I think I heard Governors Tarullo and Powell say in wanting to retain potential optionality, of giving consideration to the   possibility that if economic conditions remain on the expected course, it might actually give markets the greatest clarity if we retained the “considerable time” language, explicitly anchored to the October date.  I don’t want to commit today, but we should explore whether it could avoid the significant risk that markets will pull forward rate increases immediately on any alteration of that language or otherwise misinterpret replacement of that language, and we’ve seen that obviously in 2003 through 2004.  We also, of course, have just experienced such a misinterpretation with the taper tantrum.  Again, I don’t want to suggest that’s where we should be, but I would like to retain optionality and not have too much chatter beyond this meeting that we are necessarily going to signal our intentions through an alteration in the specific language around “considerable time.” The final thing I would say, as others have as well, is that I continue to think it’s important to be closely monitoring considerations of financial stability that might impinge on our monetary policy deliberations.  At this time, I don’t see anything that would make us want to materially alter course. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker supports alternative B and argues for maintaining continuity in the key elements of the statement. She presents several reasons for this, including weaker data on inflation and employment since the last meeting, downside risks to the forecast, and the potential cost of reversing course. She also mentions the importance of the Summary of Economic Projections in conveying data dependence and notes that market participants have pulled forward their expected date of liftoff. The speaker suggests starting a debate on how to alter the forward guidance in the future but does not advocate for any changes at this time. Overall, there is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 309.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, either one of those would work for me, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester, were you also in favor of C.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Both President Mester and Mr. Kocherlakota express agreement with either option.


Passage number 310.
 MS. MESTER.  Yes, C was my first choice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that "C was my first choice."


Passage number 311.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I’m not sure that’s accurate. CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me ask the staff a question, which is, my impression is that C doesn’t fact-check, and one thing that is very important to me is that we not say anything that is not able to be fact-checked.  My belief is that if we define inflation as the 12-month change in PCE or even core PCE, it actually doesn’t fact-check—it’s actually gone down slightly.  I mean, one could say “since earlier in the year,” which would be true, but I don’t know that that’s what we want.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and seeking clarification or confirmation from the staff.


Passage number 312.
   MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement.


Passage number 313.
 WILLIAMS.  I looked at the quarterly patterns in the Tealbook.  You know, Q3 and, most likely, Q4 inflation are going to be quite low.  So it seems a funny time to talk about gradually moving up when, in fact, the incoming data in the CPI today are kind of going the other way.  This is really a Q2 story about inflation having popped up a bit.  I would prefer personally just to drop the “somewhat.”  It seems cleaner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Williams expressing his personal preference to drop the word "somewhat."


Passage number 314.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That’s certainly my preference, to just drop “somewhat” as well. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, let me see what people think.  Yes, David.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 315.
 MR. WILCOX.  It might be relevant at this point to mention that on the basis of a little more detailed translation of this morning’s CPI, our preliminary estimate is that we’d have core PCE inflation running at about 1.3 percent in both Q3 and Q4.  That’s down from our Tealbook estimate of 1.5 percent in Q3 and 1.4 in Q4.  So we’re down 0.2 percentage point.  For what it’s worth, these are pretty small modifications, but they are in the southerly direction—that would be to the left on the real line [laughter] for core PCE.  For total PCE, for the moment we’re at 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent in Q3 and Q4, respectively.  So those are each down 0.1 percentage point relative to our Tealbook projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident in the statement "So we're down 0.2 percentage point." This implies that the new estimates differ from the Tealbook estimates, indicating a disagreement or inconsistency in the projections.


Passage number 316.
 MR. EVANS.  Can I ask a question. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The interaction between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen appears to be a simple and polite exchange.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 317.
 MR. EVANS.  President Kocherlakota invoked a dictionary definition of “somewhat,” which I’m sure is accurate, but in the Fed lexicon, it wasn’t that long ago that “somewhat” actually translated to 50 basis points.  “Slightly” was 25 in the old reserve-management language for the funds rate when we were tightening in the early 1990s, and “somewhat” was 50.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Evans, is disagreeing with President Kocherlakota's interpretation of the word "somewhat" in the context of the Federal Reserve's language. Mr. Evans argues that in the past, "somewhat" actually meant a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate, while President Kocherlakota's definition may differ.


Passage number 318.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Doesn’t it matter, though, what it applies to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "Doesn't it matter, though, what it applies to" appears to be a question expressing curiosity or interest in the importance of the subject being discussed.


Passage number 319.
   MR. EVANS.  Well, it’s an interest rate, but the units are really extraordinarily comparable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the interest rate and its units. There is no conflicting point of view or argument being presented.


Passage number 320.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But are the units the same regardless of what noun they’re referencing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply questioning whether the units remain the same regardless of the noun they are referring to. It does not express disagreement or contention.


Passage number 321.
 MR. POTTER.  I think there’s been two versions, “below” and “somewhat below.”  Bill, can you remember when we switched to “below” versus “somewhat below”.  That’s what you’re pointing out, that we’ve done this in the past in the statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are simply discussing the different versions of a statement and trying to recall when they switched from one version to another. There is no indication of any disagreement or conflict between the speakers.


Passage number 322.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes, that’s right.  I don’t feel strongly.  I just point that out. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange of statements between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen without any conflicting opinions or arguments being expressed.


Passage number 323.
 MR. FISHER.  The trimmed mean is running at 1.6 percent on a 12-month average and has been fairly consistent.  It has risen from those real lows, 0.9 percent, but it’s flat now to 1.6 percent.  I think dropping the word “somewhat” going forth, even though I’m dissenting, is something we should consider.  The fact is we’re running below the Committee’s longer-term objective. CHAIR YELLEN.  I agree with that, and I would personally be perfectly comfortable with just dropping the “somewhat.”  I think “below” is accurate, but let me see.  Is there anyone who would object to dropping it.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 324.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I’m not sure I see the point.  The intonation that a reader might put on the statement in reading it could suggest that inflation has been running below the Committee’s long-run objective.  That’s a point of emphasis.  That looks to me like we might have, in some respects, changed our emphasis, versus just keeping “somewhat.” CHAIR YELLEN.  But it’s not like we’re dropping “somewhat.”  It’s not like we said “somewhat below” and are moving now to “below.”  The “somewhat,” although it was there,   was a completely different thought.  Last time we said “inflation has moved somewhat closer to the Committee’s longer-run objective.”  So it’s not like dropping “significant” or something like that.  It’s a total change to characterizing the level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: Mr. Lockhart and Chair Yellen have differing opinions on the change in emphasis regarding inflation. Mr. Lockhart suggests that the change in wording signifies a shift in emphasis from inflation being below the Committee's objective to inflation being closer to the objective. However, Chair Yellen disagrees and argues that the change in wording does not indicate a significant shift in emphasis, as the "somewhat" in the previous statement had a different meaning altogether.


Passage number 325.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It’s being used in a different way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states that something is being used in a different way without providing any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 326.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I see that. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there any other concerns if we were to drop “somewhat” and just go to “below”.  I propose that we do that.  If we get rid of “somewhat” in the last sentence of paragraph 1, the sentence would read “Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective.”  And with those two changes, I think we’re ready to call the roll.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants seem to be discussing and agreeing on a proposal to change the wording in a sentence.


Passage number 327.
 MR. LUECKE.  The vote will cover the directive as shown on page 12 of Bill English’s briefing handout, and it will cover alternative B as shown on pages 6 and 7 of Bill English’s handout, with the exception that, in paragraph 1, the word “somewhat” will be dropped in the penultimate sentence, and in paragraph 4, the word “likely” will be removed in the second sentence. Chair YellenYes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President Fisher   No President Kocherlakota  Yes President Mester   Yes President Plosser   No Governor Powell   Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes  CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Well, that carries, and what else do I have to tell you.  Lunch.  [Laughter]  Let’s eat.  Box lunches are available now. The next meeting will be Tuesday and Wednesday, October 28 and 29, unless we end up meeting before then, which is not inconceivable.  If you want to watch me get murdered at the   press conference [laughter], there will be a TV, as usual, in the special library.  I think that’s about it, but thank you for a very good meeting.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
