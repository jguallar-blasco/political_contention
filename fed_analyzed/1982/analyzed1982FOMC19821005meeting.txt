Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that the minutes need to be approved and moves to do so.


Passage number 3.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Next is the report onforeign currency operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "without objection" indicates that there is no disagreement or contention. It suggests that everyone is in agreement with what is being stated.


Passage number 4.
MR. CROSS. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Cross is simply making a statement.


Passage number 5.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Questions or comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The passage is simply asking for questions or comments without expressing any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 6.
MS. TEETERS. We hear rumors through the paper about otherproblems in South America. How much of that can you [verify].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 7.
MR. CROSS. Well, there certainly have been some otherproblem situations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about there being other problem situations.


Passage number 8.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the understatement of the day, if Imust say so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This statement does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply reflects a personal opinion or observation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 9.
MR. CROSS. The Argentines have been mentioned a great deal,and currently they have an IMF [team] down there looking toward thepossibility of a Fund program for Argentina. They also are seekingsome assistance from the BIS and from commercial banks. TheBrazilians feel that they are being [adversely] affected largely bythe spillover effects of the Mexican and the Argentine problems. Fora period they found it very, very difficult to roll over theirmaturing debt, but more recently they sounded a bit more encouraged[so] that situation looks a little better. But you're quite rightthat there are a number of these very difficult situations, withmonetary troubles in the period [ahead] for a lot of countries downthere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in the passage. The mention of the Brazilians feeling that they are being adversely affected largely by the spillover effects of the Mexican and Argentine problems suggests a disagreement or difference of opinion between the Argentines and the Brazilians on the cause of their current difficulties.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 10.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think the [Brazilian] problem isparticularly sensitive with regard to their foreign exchange deposits[and whether their] backing by foreign banks will be resumed [as wasthe case for] the Argentine agencies. In New York we have 17Brazilian agencies and they have been having difficulty getting newdeposits or getting people to leave in the foreign deposits. We havea liquidity problem here because, like the Mexican agencies, most ofthat money was used to finance Brazilian borrowers, either public orprivate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is a liquidity problem in New York due to difficulties in getting new deposits or getting people to leave in the foreign deposits of Brazilian agencies. This suggests a disagreement or contention between the agencies and the foreign banks regarding the resumption of backing for the deposits.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 11.
MR. PARTEE. Did you say you have 17 Brazilian agencies,Tony. Is that right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes
Explanation: The use of "Did you say" implies that there may be a disagreement or misunderstanding regarding the number of Brazilian agencies Tony mentioned.


Passage number 12.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Two of them are much larger than theothers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement simply presents a comparison between two items being larger than the others. There is no indication of disagreement or argument in this statement.


Passage number 13.
 But this is part of the whole credit contraction going on inthe foreign member bank markets between--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I want to come back to some of thesequestions later. I think it's better to take them up later in thecontext of the whole policy problem. But immediately, we intervenedyesterday, as Sam said, and we may intervene today. The market isstill high. Technically we have to approve yesterday's transactions10/5/82anyway. So, do I have a motion to that effect.SPEAKER(.). So moved.SPEAKER(.). Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing a credit contraction happening in foreign member bank markets and suggesting that they address specific questions later in the context of the broader policy problem. There is no indication of disagreement or contention between speakers.


Passage number 14.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection, it is approved. As forthe Mexican swap [drawing], whatever our "druthers," the situation isthat I don't think they have any money to pay it off. So, I don'tthink we have much alternative to rolling it over. As I understandit, that doesn't take a Committee action but I think you should beinformed. If somebody wants to object, he or she can object, but theintention would be to roll that [drawing] over as it matures, notingthat we still have first claim in effect on any Fund drawing that theMexicans make, assuming they come to some conclusion with the Fund.We'll consider that at the time. But as to the immediate rollover, wecan roll that over cooperatively since otherwise.... With thatunderstanding, I think we can return to some of these other problemslater in the midst of a more general discussion, as I said. Mr.Sternlight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that there was no objection and that the Mexican swap would be rolled over. They also mention that there is first claim on any Fund drawing that the Mexicans make. The speaker then suggests returning to other problems later.


Passage number 15.
MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it consists of a single statement.


Passage number 16.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Comments or questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no clear consensus in the passage as it is not provided.


Passage number 17.
MR. FORD. [If] we can't get the new legislation and thisruling gains weight in the marketplace, what restructuring would youanticipate in the market with regard to day-to-day operations. Howwould the market accomplish that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a question asked by Mr. Ford, seeking an explanation about the potential restructuring in the market if the new legislation is not obtained and a particular ruling gains weight.


Passage number 18.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, they will be looking at differentthings. I think there will be some effort to see whether there's away to restructure the basic repurchase agreements to do pretty muchthe same thing but in a more acceptable manner in that it would standup better than [now]. To some extent there may just be a lessenedwillingness by a number of "lenders" in the market who provide funds,particularly to smaller, less well-capitalized firms. When the issueis settled--and I get a little sense of this already and that couldspread with [unintelligible]--I don't think it would affect the Desk'stechnical ability to [make] repurchase agreements. But it could thinout the market in which we do those agreements or we could havesomewhat less [access] to instruments or operations [of this kind].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing potential changes or adjustments that may be made to repurchase agreements, but there is no conflicting viewpoint being presented.


Passage number 19.
MR. ROOS. Peter, do the nonbank dealers let yoursurveillance group come in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roos is simply asking Peter if the nonbank dealers allow his surveillance group to come in.


Passage number 20.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Oh, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a simple affirmation.


Passage number 21.
MR. ROOS. On what general basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply consists of a statement or question without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 22.
 That it's the only way--MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, they've been cooperative right alongin doing that and are particularly keen to cooperate now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It indicates that the people mentioned in the passage have been cooperative and are eager to continue cooperating.


Passage number 23.
 They preferthe--MR. MORRIS. Peter, is the surveillance limited to therecognized dealers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 24.
10/5/82MR. STERNLIGHT. In an [unintelligible] way, yes. We areexploring whether we would want to extend it beyond that. Certainlyif we hear of any problem situations that go beyond the regularreporting dealer group, we would want to take a look quickly at thosesituations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they are exploring the possibility of extending something and would want to address any problem situations that arise.


Passage number 25.
MR. MORRIS. Because that is where the problem has arisenthus far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that the problem has arisen so far in a neutral manner.


Passage number 26.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Thus far, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that something has only been true up until a certain point.


Passage number 27.
MR. RICE. Peter, you said that you had the feeling that themarket would be much more tolerant of increases in the money supplyfrom the target ranges today than it would have been, say, two orthree months ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 28.
MR. STERNLIGHT. That is my impression.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Sternlight is simply stating his impression, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions mentioned.


Passage number 29.
MR. RICE. What's the evidence of that. How does thismanifest itself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a question and request for evidence or explanation, but there is no explicit contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 30.
 By discussion on the part of some of the dealers atthe Desk or by--MR. STERNLIGHT. [Unintelligible] from the market who havewritten commentaries and from discussions with market participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions discussion among dealers at the Desk, as well as commentaries and discussions with market participants. This suggests that there is likely contention or disagreement among them as they exchange different opinions and perspectives.


Passage number 31.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comments or questions. I mightsay that I think this surveillance business involves a moving target[if that] is the right term; we are feeling our way.We have to ratify the transactions.SPEAKER(.). So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states that the speaker believes the surveillance business involves a moving target and that they need to ratify the transactions. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 32.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection, they are approved. Mr.Kichline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Without objection, they are approved" indicates that the approval process proceeded smoothly and without any disagreements or objections. The mention of Mr. Kichline is unrelated to the approval process and does not introduce any contention.


Passage number 33.
MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is only a statement made by Mr. Kichline.


Passage number 34.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm inclined to suggest short comments orquestions and we can return again to the general problem a littlelater.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Instead, it discusses a suggestion and the possibility of returning to a general problem later.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 35.
MR. BOEHNE. I have a question. Your forecast and almost allthe forecasts have a phrase in them that says something like: "Theconsumer is going to lead us out of this recession," and economiclogic would suggest that there's something to that. However, when Italk to people who are in the consumer business--retailers, forexample, and bankers who are in the consumer loan area--they hear thatstatement with almost disbelief. The attitudes both on the part ofthe sellers, and it seems the buyers, are pretty sour. At least inthe northern part of the country, one hears a lot about sellingblankets and heaters and worries about oil bills and gas bills forwhat is supposed to be an unusually cold winter. My real question is:How do you weight these attitudinal factors versus the real factors.such as the tax cuts and personal income increases and so on. I thinkhow one comes down on that says a lot about what one's forecast is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning the belief that "the consumer is going to lead us out of this recession" and shares anecdotes from people in the consumer business who disagree with this statement. There is a disagreement between the speaker's perception of the consumer attitude and the forecasting models that rely on factors such as tax cuts and personal income increases.


Passage number 36.
10/5/82MR. KICHLINE. Well, I think that's right. I would say tobegin with that heaters and blankets count as consumer spending asdoes natural gas use, so that may be a plus in terms of the forecast.Secondly, I would say that for some time the views that have come outin the Redbook and elsewhere from retailers are fairly gloomy; infact, one might be led to the view that personal consumptionexpenditures were declining dramatically, just looking at that. Thatis really not the case. In the first half of the year, personalconsumption expenditures were up at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent.Our estimate for the third quarter is a rise at a rate of 1-3/4percent and we have 3-1/2 percent for the fourth quarter. Soconsumption will be up, in our view. But I would say that one wouldhave to be cautious interpreting what retailers anticipate and whattheir results were. They have been disappointed, very clearly. [Yourcomment about] the consumption-led forecast is quite correct in thatif two-thirds of the GNP doesn't respond in the way we have forecast,we're in a great deal of difficulty in part because of the rather poorprospects in the investment sector and the export sector. So,overall, [the consumer sector] is a source of concern. I would onlyremark that in our forecast we have what is a very mild cyclicalupturn. It's a bit weaker than many of the other forecasts and theattitude issue, I think, is important. It's probably very importantin the short run where the economic news is likely to be verynegative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an analysis and expressing their views on consumer spending and the forecast for the economy. They mention caution and concern, but there is no disagreement or argument presented.


Passage number 37.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage is not clear as it is cut off.


Passage number 38.
MR. BALLES. Well, coming at this confidence factor from alittle different direction, since as we all know both consumerconfidence and business confidence do play a key part in what reallyhappens, and both I'm afraid are quite weak today: I was wondering,Jim, if you have given any thought--and I'm sure you have--to thelikelihood that we may see a triple-dip recession. What probabilitywould you assign to that, if you really had a chance to think itthrough.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, Mr. Balles is expressing concern about the weak consumer confidence and business confidence affecting the possibility of a triple-dip recession. He asks Jim if he has thought about the likelihood of a triple-dip recession and what probability he would assign to it. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 39.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, I certainly wouldn't make it the mostprobable outcome. Our forecast represents our highest probability[outcome]. But for the near term, and let's view that as over thenext quarter or two, there are clear downside risks in that there isquite likely to be a negative [GNP] number in the third quarter or anegative number in the fourth quarter, and one might classify that asa triple-dip. I wouldn't say the same if I were to take a bit longerhorizon, particularly over 1983. I'd just like to say that in thefirst year of recovery in the postwar period we've had rates ofincrease of real GNP on the order of 7 to 8 percent. The staffforecast is for 3 percent. It is 3 percent for good reason. Butlowering that number, I think, begins to get a bit risky on the downside. It's very difficult when the economy, hopefully, is near thebottom of a recession to spot the potential sources of strength, butfor now it seems to me that there are clear risks on the consumerside. On the business investment side, while we have had a majordownturn in this cycle, it could very easily go weaker. So, I thinkthe short-run risks are on the down side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kichline, suggests that there are clear downside risks in the near term, with the potential for negative GNP numbers in the third and fourth quarters. However, he also mentions that if he were to take a longer-term view, particularly over 1983, he wouldn't say the same. This suggests that there is a difference in opinion on the short-term outlook for the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 40.
MR. BALLES. Jim, one other question, if I can follow up onthat: As we look back to, say, last spring--I haven't really checkedthe record so this is strictly my recollection but it is reasonably10/5/82clear--your forecast, our forecast, and most private forecasts wereconfidently expecting an upturn in the third quarter. Month aftermonth has gone by and we haven't seen it; I still don't see it. It'sstill a forecast and not a fact. Do you have any insight into whathas delayed that widely expected and anticipated upturn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents disagreement or contention. The speaker is expressing doubt and disagreement with the forecasts made by Jim and other economists that there would be an upturn in the third quarter. He questions the accuracy of those forecasts and seeks insight into the delay of the predicted upturn.


Passage number 41.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, in our own forecast, one of the majorthings that we have done is to write down business fixed investment;there has been a greater deterioration there. And in the thirdquarter, while we had the tax cut, it came along a bit smaller than wehad anticipated earlier; nevertheless, it was there. In fact, otherincome didn't come along, so that we didn't have as large a growth indisposable income in the third quarter principally because of thesharp cutbacks in business fixed investment and the lingeringinventory problems. So it's in these other sectors that weunderestimated the weakness or overestimated the performance. I don'tknow of any other major area. I guess net exports is another area, asJerry is telling me; that indeed is one of the reasons why we're muchweaker than the Commerce Department in the third quarter. Theexpected performance of net exports is much below Commerce's estimateand the August data that have come in are even weaker than that. So,exports and business fixed investment have been quite weak relative toour expectations and actual experience.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their own forecast and acknowledging areas where their expectations did not align with the actual performance of the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 42.
MR. BALLES. I wonder, in the final shot at this: To whatextent, in your opinion, do the still unprecedentedly high levels ofreal interest rates explain some of this weakness or failure torecover.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is a disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Balles, wonders about the extent to which the still unprecedentedly high levels of real interest rates explain the weakness or failure to recover. This indicates that there is a difference of opinion or uncertainty regarding the role of high real interest rates in the situation.


Passage number 43.
MR. AXILROD. I intend to get into this in my briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Axilrod, simply states his intention to discuss a certain topic in his briefing.


Passage number 44.
MR. BALLES. I'll wait for your words of wisdom.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Balles is expressing a willingness to wait for the input or advice of the other person.


Passage number 45.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without any specific context or information about what is being discussed. The phrase "Governor Wallich" alone does not provide enough information to identify contention or disagreement.


Passage number 46.
MR. WALLICH. You have an impressively low inflationprediction. In evaluating the impact of interest rates on investment,business, and housing, does that mean that you're also looking at ahigher real rate and consequently a greater restraint on investmentthan other observers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is uncertainty in the passage, but not necessarily contention or disagreement.


Passage number 47.
MR. KICHLINE. I have a lot of trouble with real rates--well,a lot of difficulty in terms of knowing what inflation expectationsare. It seems to me that real rates are high; if inflation rates aregoing down and expectations of inflation allow for that, then weindeed do have higher real rates. That's one of the elements, I wouldsay, in that some of the major commercial forecasters have assumedhigher rates of growth of M1 for next year--a percent or a percent anda half faster--so they indeed have lower nominal interest rates thanthe staff. So, interest rates are one of the drags here, and theyhave been for some time, in terms of monetary constraint standing inthe way of recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is primarily a statement expressing difficulties and observations regarding real rates and inflation expectations. There is no explicit disagreement or conflicting viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 48.
MR. MARTIN. Let me ask a question with regard to consumerattitudes and the [role] of the consumer balance sheet, if you will,in that. Which way, if any, does the substantial improvement in theconsumer's liquidity position cut vis-a-vis attitudes toward10/5/82residential [property] on the asset side. That is: Is the consumerlikely to consider his wealth as a plus or a minus factor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the use of the phrases "if any" and "Is the consumer likely to consider his wealth as a plus or a minus factor." These phrases indicate that there are opposing viewpoints or uncertainty about the consumer's attitude towards their wealth in relation to residential property.


Passage number 49.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, that differs with individual consumers.I think you are quite right in pointing out that short-term borrowinghas been rather moderate; in fact, repayments relative to income havecome off from their peak in late 1978. But at the same time one ofthe major sources of wealth in the household sector, namely housing,has clearly become less liquid for many.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents different points of view and observations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 50.
MR. MARTIN. And less valuable perhaps.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement. The phrase "And less valuable perhaps" suggests that the speaker disagrees with the idea that the subject in question is less valuable.


Passage number 51.
MR. KICHLINE. And the price may well have gone down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "And the price may well have gone down" is a speculation about a possibility and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 52.
 Thoseare offsetting factors and I don't know how one would come out, but itcertainly--MR. MARTIN. That was my question. How does one come out.You're not coming out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrases "Those are offsetting factors" and "I don't know how one would come out" indicate that there is a lack of agreement or certainty about the outcome of a certain situation. Furthermore, the interruption of Mr. Martin implies that there may be a disagreement or difference of opinion between the speakers.


Passage number 53.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The answer is he doesn't know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "The answer is he doesn't know" simply implies that someone doesn't have knowledge about something.


Passage number 54.
MR. KICHLINE. One simply has to put those two thingstogether. One can't look at the improvement in short-term liquidityalone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states that one cannot only consider the improvement in short-term liquidity alone; one has to consider other factors as well.


Passage number 55.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I heard a commentary on the radio when Igot up this morning indicating that fuel is in ample supply for thiswinter season. I don't know the survey, but what surprised me is thatthey said prices are going to be--I forget precisely what number theyused--6 to 12 percent above last year. That surprised me a littlebecause I thought that oil prices had leveled off during this period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses surprise and a lack of knowledge about the survey.


Passage number 56.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Gas has gone down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "Gas has gone down." It is a straightforward statement that states a fact without any opposing viewpoints or contradictions.


Passage number 57.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This was oil.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "This was oil" presents a fact or observation without any indication of conflicting perspectives or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 58.
MR. PARTEE. Did they say that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is simply a dialogue where MR. PARTEE asks a question, but the response or continuation of the conversation is not provided.


Passage number 59.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, it was about oil supplies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage since it only presents a statement about oil supplies without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 60.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think the reports have been on private homeheating fuel.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states Mr. Gramley's opinion or statement.


Passage number 61.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This was home heating fuel that they weretalking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "This was home heating fuel that they were talking about." This statement is simply providing clarification or context.


Passage number 62.
MR. GRAMLEY. Supplies of home heating fuel I think arerather low relative to the stock of petroleum generally.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 63.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This was a two sentence comment in thenews. They said they had done a little survey and stocks were ample.People were going to have plenty of fuel this winter but the price wasgoing to be 6 to 12 percent higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 64.
MR. PARTEE. Being a consumer, Paul, [I recall that] theprice rose as the last heating seasonal went off and it hasn'tdeclined except by two or three cents. So, this season will start outwith prices materially higher than at the beginning of last season.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the rise in prices in the previous heating season and how it will affect prices for the upcoming season.


Passage number 65.
10/5/82MR. KICHLINE. Well, we don't have that in our forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they do not have a certain item in their forecast.


Passage number 66.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I thought it had been level for a longwhile but it may be that it got back to where it was a year ago. Itsurprised me that they were up that much in a year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 67.
MR. FORD. I have one quick question about your forecast.Looking at your forecast compared to others we track yours against--Townsend-Greenspan, DRI, Citibank, and Chase--you are uniformly themost bearish for the next three quarters, and by a substantial margin.You have far and away the lowest GNP growth rates, the lowestinflation forecast, and the highest unemployment forecast, which areall consistent in a very bearish pattern. I just want to understandif what you said in answer to a question--from John, I think--was thatyour next-best forecast was even more bearish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that the forecast being discussed is the most bearish compared to others they track, implying that there is a difference of opinion among forecasters.


Passage number 68.
MR. GRAMLEY. May I point out one other factor in thisrespect. The staff forecast has been uniformly the most pessimisticfor the past year-and-a-half and it has overestimated the performanceof the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply pointing out a factor related to the staff's forecast.


Passage number 69.
MR. FORD. You are saying they are right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "Mr. Ford. You are saying they are right." It is a statement acknowledging agreement or validation.


Passage number 70.
MR. GRAMLEY. We're looking at a situation in which I thinkJim is quite right that all the risks at this point are on the downside, both from the domestic demand side and from export demand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley agrees with Jim that all the risks are on the downside.


Passage number 71.
MR. FORD. One thing that worries me is what none of usexpects. We are all very bearish and you are very bearish. Do yougive zero probability, then, to the possibility of a surge in theeconomy. The consumer's car is getting older and older; more and moreconsumers are looking for a place to live as all these baby boomersget married or whatever [and create households]. With householdliquidity getting stronger and stronger and with savings up, you don'tsee any possibility of a surge in the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 72.
MR. KICHLINE. Not in the very short run. We have indeedbuilt in a bit of an increase in auto sales. In that market, all ofthe news I've run across has to be viewed as rather negative. Iwouldn't perceive any of these areas as bursting out on the up side inthe very near term, but I wouldn't extend that forecast through 1983,as I said. We have in our forecast some pluses in these areas. It'sa matter of how much. I don't know of anything at the moment thatwould suggest to me that we are likely to see major growth in the veryshort term. But these issues are debatable and I certainly wouldn'twant to argue the consumer case very strongly [even] in the shortterm.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging that there is negative news in the auto sales market, but states that there may be some positives in the forecast. They also mention that the issues discussed are debatable and indicate that they do not want to strongly argue for the consumer case in the short term.


Passage number 73.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The name "Governor Partee" does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 74.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I was one who believed that there would bea recovery in the second half. But I must say that over the years thetwo indicators that I have watched and thought most consistentlyindicated the future were new orders for durable goods and initialclaims for [unemployment] insurance. And they both have [tended] tovary significantly. We had a 4 percent decline in durable goodsorders in the latest month and we had a very substantial increase in10/5/82initial claims for insurance. So I see no reason that we shouldn'tpredict a decline in activity in the period to come.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their belief based on their observation of two indicators.


Passage number 75.
MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or indications of contention or disagreement between individuals. It simply mentions the name "Mr. Roos" and address the chairman.


Passage number 76.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the phrase "Yes, sir". It is a simple affirmation or confirmation of something.


Passage number 77.
MR. ROOS. Just to avoid total desperation, we have a littlemore positive view of [the outlook]. First of all, we weren'tsurprised at the fairly slow growth in output in the third quarterbecause we feel that it was to a great extent a reflection of themonetary contraction that occurred earlier in the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Instead, it presents a perspective on the slow growth in output in the third quarter and attributes it to a monetary contraction.


Passage number 78.
 However,-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I never figured out where that expansion[went] from the monetary expansion still earlier in the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 79.
MR. ROOS. We think--and again it's a matter of relativevalue--that the contraction in output would have been even worse hadthere not been that expansion. However, we feel that if money isallowed to grow at, say, 5 to 5-1/2 percent or slightly above that, wewill see a much more positive effect on output certainly starting nextyear. We observe in the record that the economy always tends to movetoward about a 3-1/2 percent trend growth of output. We think,inasmuch as we've had about 3 years of very slow growth--and we blameit on monetary contractions--and price increases have finally slowedand real interest rates are approaching normal levels, that much ofthe adjustment that was caused by that and by foreign competitionbeing a factor in heavy industry has been completed. We think thatquite conceivably we could have a bit faster rebound next year, basedon 5-1/2 percent money growth, than some others have forecast. If I'mwrong, I won't be here, Mr. Chairman; if I'm right, you'll hear fromme.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker is presenting their perspective and predictions on the effect of monetary growth and its potential positive impact on output.


Passage number 80.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 81.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, Larry rescued us from the straitsof desperation and said some of the things I had in mind. There aretwo things that might be helpful to remember here. One is that italways looks very, very bleak right at the bottom and we all get verypessimistic, and I'm much more pessimistic than any of my associatesin Richmond. The second point is that there's a very low pickup invelocity projected over the next four quarters. And traditionallymost forecasters at this stage of the business cycle--maybe I shouldsay at this apparent stage--have underestimated the pickup invelocity. We ought to bear those things in mind as we move throughthe meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 82.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If no one else has an immediate comment,we'll turn to Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that if no one else has a comment, they will turn to Mr. Axilrod. This suggests a lack of contention or disagreement as there seems to be a consensus or agreement among the group.


Passage number 83.
MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement or indication of contention or disagreement. It seems to be a neutral statement or a clarification request.

Passage number 85.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We don't want to prejudge these things toohastily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. The speaker is expressing caution and a desire to avoid making judgments too quickly, indicating a sense of uncertainty or lack of preconceived bias.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 86.
10/5/82MR. ROOS. Well, isn't this similar to the NOW accountsituation. Didn't we adjust for NOW accounts. Can't we do the samething and avoid the possibility that people would misconstrue this asa major change in policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roos is questioning whether the situation is similar to the NOW accounts, and suggesting that they make a similar adjustment to avoid any misconceptions about a major change in policy.


Passage number 87.
MR. AXILROD. We could make efforts to make shift adjustmentsin somewhat the same way, probably with the same degree ofcredibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 88.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I might feel differently if Ithought they had the same degree of credibility. I don't think thestaff is capable of making them with the same degree of credibility,however great that was, as last time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker states a personal opinion about their perception of credibility but does not express any disagreement or contention with others. The statement only reflects the speaker's own thoughts and does not involve any conflicting ideas or arguments.


Passage number 89.
MR. AXILROD. I thought it was small.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "I thought it was small" expresses a personal opinion or perception, but does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 90.
MS. TEETERS. Steve, how would you actually operate. Howwould you draw your reserves paths [with a] wider specification.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question asking for clarification on how to draw reserves paths, so there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 91.
MR. PARTEE. Run on the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement about the action of running on the funds rate.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 92.
MR. AXILROD. If there were not a specification for M1 andthere were for M2 or M3, we would draw them on the basis of the M2 orM3 specifications and we would draw an M1 path, unless told otherwise,that we thought was generally consistent with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker is suggesting that if there were specifications for M2 or M3 but not for M1, they would draw an M1 path based on the M2 or M3 specifications. This implies a potential disagreement or contention about how to determine the M1 path.


Passage number 93.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we may be getting a little aheadof ourselves in this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion but there is no indication of any disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 94.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I have a question on the instrumentthe DIDC [plans to authorize]. As I understand it, it seems that at aminimum what we're going to get out of the DIDC is an instrument thatgoes into M2. But it depends on how they word it. If they put outtwo instruments, one of which is reserveable, then the one that isreserveable would be in M1. Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and understanding about the instrument and how it would affect the M1 and M2 money supply.


Passage number 95.
MR. AXILROD. Well, the one that is reserveable certainlywould be in M1. Where the other one would be is a question one wouldhave to consider carefully, I think. It will [allow] at least sixtransfers. Our present boundary line, other than for money marketfunds, is about three transfers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement explaining the location and transfer limits of certain types of funds.


Passage number 96.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It doesn't make any difference where weput it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It suggests that the specific location does not matter or have an impact.


Passage number 97.
MR. PARTEE. But, Tony, a ceiling-free reserveable deposithas a lot of different implications for M1 than one on which themaximum [rate] paid is 5-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 98.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Right; I understand that. But if theDIDC words it fairly broadly, and we insist that because of the numberof transactions exceeding the six--I gather it's three drafts orchecks and three other forms of authorized transfers--then we couldput a reserve requirement on it so that in both cases on anythingover, let's say, $5,000, they would be paying market rates, exceptthat one would be marginally lower than the other because of thereserve requirement. It seems inevitable to me that the reserveableone would be in M1, in which case we might get a major bulge. It's10/5/82unpredictable as always. But the other one, which we're sure to geteven if they word it narrowly, must be in M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their understanding and making a prediction based on it.


Passage number 99.
 I don't see--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but I'm not sure it makes anydifference analytically. It makes a difference in the number,obviously. But in either case we won't know what the heck the numbermeans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker acknowledges the difference in numbers but also states that it does not make any difference analytically. There is no clear contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 100.
MR. AXILROD. If it were in M2, it could lead to a very sharpcontraction in M1, if NOW accounts shifted into [that instrument].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a hypothetical situation.


Passage number 101.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We would get two unknowns withenormous swings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact.


Passage number 102.
MR. AXILROD. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod simply agrees with a statement or confirms its accuracy.


Passage number 103.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think you touched upon the problemthat may begin in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a personal opinion or observation regarding a problem that may arise in October but does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 104.
MR. AXILROD. No, I didn't mention in this briefing the allsavers certificates, Mr. Chairman. We mentioned in the Bluebook thatthis week $22 billion of originally issued all savers certificatesmature, with a maturity value of $25 billion including interest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents factual information without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 105.
 Ourlimited preliminary estimate of the likely effect on M1, which isnothing more than a very informed guess--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What's informed about it. Steve did asurvey of four people all of whom are going to put it into M1,including himself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating that the preliminary estimate of the likely effect on M1 is a guess, but an informed guess. Additionally, it mentions that Steve conducted a survey of four people, including himself, who will contribute to M1.


Passage number 106.
MR. AXILROD. We are at the moment guessing that there willbe about a $7 billion increase in M1 in the current week from that.But it could, depending on how long it lasts--though we think it wouldbe temporary generally--have a very sizable effect. And there are atotal of $33 billion or so maturing in the course of this month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is purely stating information and potential effects.


Passage number 107.
MS. TEETERS. People could roll it over into another allsavers certificate, couldn't they.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement evident in this passage. The statement is providing a suggestion or question, and there is no sign of disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 108.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, if they haven't used up their $2,000 intax-free interest. But to the degree one is going to invest insomething else, it could go into a NOW account or demand accounttemporarily as one waits to invest it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply stating that if someone hasn't used up their tax-free interest, they can invest in something else temporarily while waiting to invest it further.


Passage number 109.
MS. TEETERS. And then the all savers certificate disappearscompletely on December 31st. You can't go into it afterwards.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply stating a fact about the all savers certificate disappearing on a certain date.


Passage number 110.
MR. AXILROD. That I'm not sure about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty about something.


Passage number 111.
MR. PARTEE. You can't go into it, but of course there couldbe a lot of outstandings for quite a while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that there could be some outstanding issues for a while, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 112.
MR. BALLES. Where is that now--in M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of disagreement or contention. It is a simple question asking for the location of something.


Passage number 113.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, they are all in M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of fact.


Passage number 114.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do you think the country would rallypatriotically, if we made a public call that maturing all saverscertificates should be reinvested in M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The sentence is a simple question asking for the reader's opinion on whether the country would rally patriotically if a public call was made to reinvest all savers certificates in M2.


Passage number 115.
10/5/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a little late, I'm afraid.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply indicates that it is late, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 116.
MR. MARTIN. On the theory that only the lost causes areworth fighting for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing a belief or theory.

Passage number 118.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about Mr. Black's actions or statements that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 119.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, Tony touched on my question. I wasjust going to ask Steve if he would elaborate a bit more on conditionsunder which this might increase M1 as opposed to decreasing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black is simply stating that Tony's question coincides with his own, and he wants Steve to provide further information on the subject.


Passage number 120.
MR. AXILROD. Do you mean partly the all savers certificates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question and does not involve any conflicting opinions or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 121.
MR. BLACK. I'm talking about the money market account.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 122.
MR. AXILROD. Well, if an account were offered, let's say aSuper NOW account, where you could write all the checks you wanted andthat was already in M1 and it was [ceiling] free on funds over acertain amount, I would see sizable transfers out of money marketfunds as well as other savings deposits right into M1 from that. Thatwould occur almost instantaneously.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage describes a hypothetical situation where an account called a Super NOW account is introduced, which could potentially lead to transfers from money market funds and other savings deposits into M1. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 123.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we counted it in M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "If we counted it in M1" simply suggests a hypothetical situation or condition without expressing any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 124.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, because there is not enough information given in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 125.
 Yes, and it would--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Theoretically we could get an increase inM1, I guess, without counting it in M1 if it was so attractive thateverybody went into NOW accounts for their basic account and got anautomatic sweep arrangement into these new accounts. We would getmore increase in the below $5,000 portion of NOW accounts as a kind oftail on the dog of this new account.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply discussing a theoretical scenario.


Passage number 126.
MR. AXILROD. It's quite conceivable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement by Mr. Axilrod is simply expressing a possibility or speculation without any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 127.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know how we'd ever measure it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing uncertainty or a lack of knowledge about how to measure something.


Passage number 128.
MR. AXILROD. We could. It's like suddenly permitting amarket rate of interest on demand deposits. And to the degree theaccount is like that, it's in M1, which ought to increase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is suggesting that allowing a market rate of interest on demand deposits could increase the account's status in M1.


Passage number 129.
MR. BLACK. I have been assuming that the instrument wouldnot have that much in the way of check-writing privileges and it wouldprobably depress M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Black, is simply stating his assumptions and speculating about the potential impact of the instrument on M1.


Passage number 130.
MR. AXILROD. It may very well. I was answering yourquestion on the conditions under which it would increase M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement and a response to a question.


Passage number 131.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, would you comment on the likelihoodin your judgment that it would have that much check-writing ability.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. The speaker simply asks the chairman for their judgment on the likelihood of a certain scenario.


Passage number 132.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. The law says so. There's verylittle left to decide on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that there is agreement because the law dictates what should be done, leaving no room for disagreement or contention.


Passage number 133.
 I think the size of the check is theonly thing that will be---11-10/5/82MR. BLACK. That's what I had in mind. That might limit itsuse to no more activity than present money market mutual funds, whichhave a very low rate of turnover relative to the NOW accounts andother kinds of transaction balances as currently defined. That's whatI was thinking was the most likely outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the speaker's thoughts and opinions without any conflicting viewpoints or conflicting statements.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 134.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. [The DIDC] clearly can't circumventthe intent of the Congress by putting a minimum value of $5,000 forchecks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates disagreement or contention. The phrase "clearly can't circumvent the intent of the Congress" suggests disagreement with the action taken by the DIDC in setting a minimum value for checks.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 135.
MR. BLACK. Even $500, Tony, might give it characteristicsmore like M2 than M1. But one could certainly debate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage as indicated by the phrase "But one could certainly debate that." This suggests that there is room for argument or differing opinions regarding whether $500 would give characteristics more like M2 than M1.


Passage number 136.
MR. CORRIGAN. Even then, we still could get a very sizablebuildup in M1 balances in connection with the account. It's verysimple to conceive of that situation even with a $1,000 limit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that even with a $1,000 limit, it is possible to have a substantial increase in M1 balances related to the account.


Passage number 137.
MR. MORRIS. Is there any work being done by the staff inanticipation of the time when we will have to decide what to do withmonetary policy when we finally admit that M1 is no longer a sensibletarget.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking if there is any work being done by the staff in anticipation of a future decision regarding monetary policy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 138.
MR. BLACK. You're prejudging our conclusions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

There is contention or disagreement in the passage because Mr. Black is accusing the other party of prejudging their conclusions, implying that there is a disagreement or conflict of opinions regarding the conclusions in question.


Passage number 139.
MR. MORRIS. I'm talking about contingency planning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Morris, is simply stating that he is talking about contingency planning.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 140.
MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I would agree with Frank, strange asit may seem, that before we bury my old friend M1 at this meeting--this [new instrument] won't take effect for a couple of months--thereought to be some work done by the various economic staffs to try toproject the effect. There are a lot of people who don't like my oldfriend M1, and whenever anything changes they say this is a good timeto bury M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker agrees with Frank but mentions that there are people who do not like M1 and take advantage of any changes to criticize it.


Passage number 141.
MR. MORRIS. We love it. We just can't find it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that "We love it," indicating agreement or satisfaction. The only issue mentioned is that they cannot find it, which does not imply any disagreement among the speakers.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 142.
MR. ROOS. But couldn't some study be done prior to changingour basic approach to policymaking. I'm a little paranoid--I guess Ihave been for most of my life with the Federal Reserve--that everytime something comes up that casts some suspicion on M1, there's anawful lot of readiness to bury it. Does our policy action todayrequire that we do something that's a significant departure from theway we've been doing things. Couldn't this matter be studied andcouldn't we have a summit meeting if necessary, a la Jerry's[suggestion], prior to our next meeting of the FOMC to see what thebest brains in the System think will be the result of the DIDC actionand everything else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows disagreement or contention between Mr. Roos and others regarding the need for a study and a possible summit meeting before making policy changes. Mr. Roos argues for further study and discussion, while others may be more ready to take immediate action.


Passage number 143.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, yes and no is the answer, I think.Obviously, we can study the matter. I see no prospect that any amountof study is going to tell us what the behavior of M1 is going to be inthe short run. It is unknowable, in my opinion, to all the bestbrains in the world. It's going to be an empirical question; we willdiscover what happens when it happens. And we have to look at it overa period of time. But I don't see that any amount of rumination--isthat the right word.--is going to produce an answer to a knowablequestion but an unknowable answer. The wish for a study is fine; butthe sense that it's going to give us an answer in a month before we10/5/82get the new instrument I think is totally unwarranted just by thenature of the problem that we face.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion that studying the behavior of M1 in the short run is unknowable and that it will be an empirical question that can only be answered when it happens. They also mention that any amount of rumination or study is unlikely to produce a definitive answer before the new instrument is available.


Passage number 144.
MR. GUFFEY. If I understand what we're discussing, you arereally talking about M1. The impact on M2 would be considerably less;it is a more reliable guide.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, is stating his understanding and making a clarification about the topic being discussed. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 145.
MR. PARTEE. A little more subtle, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states their opinion on the matter.


Passage number 146.
MR. GUFFEY. More subtle perhaps but nonetheless--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that something may be more subtle but still exists.


Passage number 147.
 And M3-type deposits--MR. PARTEE. Other things equal, it ought to increase thevalue of M2-type instruments compared with market instruments.Therefore, M2 ought to be larger relative to total credit flows thanbefore. And by the way, I think the real world effect will befantastic shifts of funds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a belief and predicting a positive outcome.


Passage number 148.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think there's any question,however, that Roger is right. The impact is going to be much less onM2 and M3 than on M1. The only place it can come out of basically isTreasury bills.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the impact on M2, M3, and Treasury bills.


Passage number 149.
MR. AXILROD. President Roos, I wasn't suggesting burying M1;I was suggesting that there is a problem over the next two or threemonths.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply clarifying their suggestion to President Roos.


Passage number 150.
MR. ROOS. Well, you didn't suggest we praise it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 151.
MR. FORD. This is sounding more and more like Pericles'oration on Caesar's burial.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making a comparison between the current situation and Pericles' speech about Caesar's burial.


Passage number 152.
MR. ROOS. It was Mark Antony's.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply states a fact or historical event.


Passage number 153.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions the Chairman Volcker and does not provide any information about contention or disagreement.


Passage number 154.
 We will get to the issue of what to dowith M1 a little later, but I--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Just one last question on the DIDCinstrument: Based on your information, what kind of rate do you thinkthe depository institutions will pay as the so-called market rate.Will they simply be competitive and vary it with the average moneymarket fund rate or will they pay a Treasury bill-type rate. What doyou think they will pay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 155.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think there will be a tendency amongsome to pay a money market funds rate plus; the question is whetherthe market gets driven there. I'm just guessing. Among other things,we approved what I think of as the "bucket shop relief regulation" atthe last DIDC meeting, where an institution can broker all of thismoney. So, we'll have people advertising all over the country. Thesewill be insured deposits and people will keep it with the guy payingthe highest rate. And that will tend to force the rates higher. Iwould think there would be two tendencies initially: To pay a moneymarket funds rate plus, or to pay something related to the Treasurybill rate. My guess would be that the bill rate fellows might getforced higher. In a tight money situation, I would feel ratherconfident of that result. With rates going down, if they are going10/5/82down, I think banks would be cautious. But I think those will be thetwo polarities. The question is where it will end up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker discusses two different tendencies - paying a money market funds rate plus or paying something related to the Treasury bill rate - and suggests that the bill rate fellows might get forced higher. This implies that there is contention or disagreement about where the rates will ultimately end up.


Passage number 156.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If there is any erosion of the banks'core deposits moving into these Super NOWs or whatever we call thisnew instrument, it's going to put a terrible squeeze on their profits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 157.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If this had been done three months ago, Ithink it would have been an utter disaster. It may just be a disasternow. You know, I joke with the banks at times. I tried it out withthe banks this morning and they said fine; they haven't thought thisout. But I said that the simple way to do this and be perfectlyconsistent with the law is to say [to a depositor] "If you have a NOWaccount or a savings account [with a balance] above $5,000, it nolonger has a ceiling rate and it's checkable." If a financialinstitution thinks of it in those terms, immediately that puts itscost of funds up by a significant amount. I'm sure when they thinkabout it, they won't want it that way. It will take time for thesavings depositors to pull out their money and go to the bank and sayinstead of my savings deposit, I want this new account. Some of themwill never get to the bank, so the banks will retain some of theirsavings deposits and NOW accounts by a kind of "discrimination byignorance" approach. And who knows how long that transition periodwill take.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is mainly a statement of the speaker's thoughts and opinions about a potential course of action and its potential consequences.


Passage number 158.
MR. PARTEE. They don't have to pay a market rate or tie itto a market rate; they could pay the CPI plus 4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact or a possibility.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 159.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The European bankers look at thisderegulation process going on in the United States and they react withhorror. In their view, this whole deregulation is such a disasterboth for monetary policy and for the stability of the banking systemthat I think we are once and for all--through our experiment, if youwant to call it that--making sure that no deregulation process isgoing to be copied in foreign countries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The European bankers react with horror to the deregulation process in the United States and view it as a disaster, while the author suggests that the deregulation process is an experiment that should not be copied in foreign countries.


Passage number 160.
"MR. FORD. Excuse me, who is this group.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is simply a question asking for clarification.


Passage number 161.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It was a group of ABA bankers, but that'sincidental. It is going on. That is why all these South Americancountries together suddenly can't find financing or financing inanywhere near the volume that they were anticipating. And to theextent that that financing demand is going on, that presses more andmore on a relative handful of major money market banks that arealready, of course, very heavily extended. The extent to which thisis going on in domestic markets is less clear, but I would sense thatsome of this atmosphere is developing in domestic markets. In a sensethat means that market rate quotations don't mean quite the same thingas they meant some months ago, because there's a question of who canget those rates and with what degree of aggressiveness. All of thisin a way, it seems to me, is explained in the velocity numbers. Thereis a little liquidity preference or desire, or however you want to putit, which is why the relationships that we look at all the timebetween liquid asset totals and money narrowly or broadly [defined] donot seem to bear the same relationship to economic activity that wemight have anticipated. I find it difficult or impossible to explainthat except, in part, because of a change in liquidity preference.People want to be liquid; they want to hold as many liquid balances asthey are permitted to hold and the constraining factor is how many ofthose are made available to them.I'd say all of this leads to a considerable feeling infinancial markets and elsewhere of developing disarray, a certainfloundering. And that in itself contributes to uncertainty, whichfeeds upon itself. And it is dangerous in and of itself. I don'tmean to suggest going back to point number one about the domesticoutlook and saying that the prospects as a matter of probabilityaren't along the lines that Mr. Kichline suggested. Hopefully, asattitudes change, it could turn out to be significantly better thanthat. But I do think we are in an extremely tricky period oftransition that is complicated enormously by the factors not just of aperiod of potential transition for us, but for the world economy as awhole. There is not a single source of real strength or certainty outthere.10/5/82So far as the international situation is concerned, let mejust suggest that we sorely need a victory, or a series of victories,in terms of stability in some key countries. We would like to havethat in Mexico. Whether that's possible or not I already expressed myuncertainty about. If it's not going to be in Mexico, there hadbetter be dikes built pretty promptly around some of these othercountries so that there is not a feeling of absolute inevitability,which is developing rapidly in the market, that all of these countriesare going to go down like a bunch of tenpins. If we cannot deal withthat prospect, we are going to be in sorry trouble indeed. There areobvious cases in point; Yugoslavia and Argentina are both now innegotiation with the Fund. Neither of those countries has[irreparable] economic conditions by any means, as nearly as I canunderstand it. The amounts of money involved are relatively small butnot exactly trivial in either case. Right behind them is a countrylike Chile, and not very far behind that, of course, is the big one,Brazil. I don't see how any of those situations, with the possibleexception of Brazil and conceivably Chile--if the dikes are strongenough around Argentina and Yugoslavia--is going to be handled withoutFund assistance and without further official assistance outside theFund. I think this is logically the Treasury's job. Whether thelogic is going to prevail in the end here is something that at somepoint we're going to have to consider, given the stakes involved.Domestically, I would simply say that I don't think this isany time for taking any great chances. There is a substantive needfor a relaxation of pressures in the private markets in the UnitedStates. How best to achieve that seems to me is the question beforethe house. I will cease and desist at this point. I note that coffeeis ready and maybe this is as good a time as any to have it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the current state of financing and liquidity in international and domestic markets, expressing concern about the potential for economic instability. There is no conflicting viewpoint presented in the passage.


Passage number 162.
[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can now have a general discussion. Atsome point I will give you some directive language that is somewhatdifferent [than shown in the draft provided by the staff]. But beforethat, we can have a general discussion of the business scene, theinternational scene, or whatever. I would like not to neglect theinternational situation with respect to some of these countries. Thisis not a time, as I undoubtedly implied--that's a mild word--forbusiness as usual, certainly, in the international area. I don'tthink it's time for business as usual in the domestic area either.Extraordinary things may have to be done. We haven't had a parallelto this situation historically except to the extent 1929 was aparallel.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It expresses the speaker's perspective and thoughts without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 163.
MR. MARTIN. And 1931.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only provides a statement by Mr. Martin, without any context or conversation that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 164.
MR. PARTEE. 1931.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the year 1931.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 165.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And I might say that I commend you all: Idetected no leaks after the last meeting. We are discussing obviouslyhighly sensitive subjects in this particular meeting and I can'timpress that too strongly upon you. I'm talking about some of theseinternational financial problems, especially their domestic ones. Anyone of these things can be blown by inadvertent comments. There isdiscussion going on, particularly with respect to Argentina andYugoslavia, of central banking monetary authority packages. The-19-10/5/82question is whether those packages are big enough for the situation inboth cases. As I said, they are in negotiation with the Fund.Yugoslavia has been operating under a Fund program, but it's a rollingone-year [credit]. The third year of it is under discussion at themoment. These are in theory governmental matters and in ourinstitutional structure more appropriate for the ExchangeStabilization Fund than for the Federal Reserve. I think the Treasurywould say that, too. But they have concerns and limited amounts ofmoney, and at some point I think it's possible that we will have tomake a decision within the confines of this room as to whether wecontribute to them too, simply in order to get the money big enough.And that raises issues that we have not had to face before--exceptperhaps marginally in the case of Mexico. I don't know if it's goingto come up; I hope it doesn't. My position is that it should not comeup. On the other hand, I cannot exclude it, given the nature of theproblem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that there is discussion and negotiation regarding the monetary authority packages for Argentina and Yugoslavia, and the question is whether those packages are big enough for the situation. This implies that there are differing opinions or disagreements about the adequacy of the packages.


Passage number 166.
MR. ROOS. How should we respond, if we are on the speakingcircuit and are asked what our impression is of the internationalsituation. How do you respond to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a direct question from Mr. Roos, inquiring about how one should respond to a specific situation. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 167.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, with difficulty.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The phrase "with difficulty" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that something is challenging or not easy to accomplish.


Passage number 168.
MR. MARTIN. Very carefully.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any signs of contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Martin is being very careful. There is no conflict or argument presented.


Passage number 169.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Obviously, you give some sense ofconfidence as best you can.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses the idea of trying to instill confidence in the best way possible.


Passage number 170.
MR. PARTEE. Say "I have another appointment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a simple statement where Mr. Partee informs someone that he has another appointment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 171.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me say in that connection--and Ishould have said it more clearly before--that I think this situationis manageable. In a very big sense, I think we are on the verge ofvictory in what we've been trying to do. It's a delicate situation,but it's also a very risky situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The speaker seems to have conflicting thoughts or emotions about the situation. They first say that they think the situation is manageable and that victory is near, but then also describe it as delicate and risky, indicating some disagreement or uncertainty about the outcome.


Passage number 172.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What kind of victory, a Pyrrhicvictory.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply posing a question about the type of victory.


Passage number 173.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, though it could turn into a Pyrrhicvictory.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It states a possibility (that it could turn into a Pyrrhic victory) but does not present any conflicting viewpoints or contradictory statements.


Passage number 174.
MR. PARTEE. We're going to get prices going down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee's statement simply states an intention to lower prices.


Passage number 175.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But, in my opinion, it's only going to bemanageable with unusual exertions. And in the end I'm afraid thisinstitution may be called upon for unusual exertion simply becausethere is no other in a comparable position. It's the only possibilityin terms of having the leadership and the resources necessary to dealwith some of these problems. I don't know whether we can[unintelligible] that issue. But I think that is the nature of theproblem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and expressing concern about the institution's ability to handle the challenges they mention. There is no indication of any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 176.
MR. ROOS. Is it possible to assume that this internationalproblem is not a consequence of our anti-inflationary efforts and thatif our [anti-inflationary] program had never been undertaken this samesort of international situation could exist in a highly inflationary[environment].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply posing a hypothetical question about whether the international problem is a result of anti-inflationary efforts or if it could exist in a highly inflationary environment.


Passage number 177.
10/5/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think all of these problems in aconsiderable degree emerge out the inflationary situation most broadly--a decade or more of loose practices, if that's the right term.Sooner or later Mexico was going to get in trouble. They borrowed $20billion last year. And they borrowed heaven knows how many billionsof dollars net this year when they still could borrow--before they gotin trouble. The timing of it is affected by recession, high interestrates, and all the rest. But I think it's patently obvious thatMexico was going to borrow all it could borrow and all the banks weregoing to give them and at some point that was going to come to an end.And it was going to be a crisis situation. I think one can say thatabout most of these other countries. So we may be talking about thetiming, but we are not talking about the essence of the matter in thatmany of these countries, as are companies at home and bankingpractices at home, are on an unsustainable course. We can't have abanking system that's totally loaned up to Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela,Argentina and Yugoslavia, but that's the direction they were going in.And some day that had to stop.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion and observations.


Passage number 178.
MS. TEETERS. Will these containment efforts be done incooperation with the BIS the way Mexico was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply asks whether the containment efforts will be done in cooperation with the BIS, similar to how it was done in Mexico.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 179.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, the current ones are under discussionwith the BIS but there is the inherent management difficulty of theseproblems. There are very substantive economic problems and,underneath that, social problems and political problems. But from themanagement standpoint, the difficulty is that there are so manyactors. Mexico is the extreme case, but it's only a more extremeexample of reality. In Mexico, we are dealing with 1,100 banks orsomething like that. When you're dealing with that many banks aroundthe world, not just all over the United States but all over the world--and I mean banks you've never heard the name of in [Saudi] Arabia orthe Far East or wherever--getting all those banks to sit in the canoetogether is a little difficult. The same problem exists when dealingwith the BIS or in any cooperative international effort. There are alot of actors. They don't all understand the problem in the samedegree and they all see a little different self-interest in thesituation. I think almost all the central banks recognize some commoninterest in seeing an overall solution to the problem, but they have alot of individual interests, too, and getting them all to negotiatetogether is difficult. Everybody wants all the countries in; that'sthe tradition. And we get into this ridiculous situation where acountry that is putting in $12-1/2 million has the same voice as theUnited States does. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but there isthat kind of problem. They are all dealing with their owninstitutional structure. No central bank wants to touch thesesituations in the sense of a traditional central banking operation.They all would take the same attitude that we probably would take:It's a governmental problem. And some of them have institutions to doit and some don't. In virtually every case the central bank has moreflexibility in the short run than the government; some governmentshave none. Some central banks may not have any. We have this kind ofproblem, of course. The U.S. government itself is like dealing withfour different countries. But you multiply that and the difficultybecomes geometric, I guess, even when we're only dealing with 10 or 12countries. It's obviously important to get not just a facade but thereality of some international cooperation in these things--not justbecause of the money, which is significant, but because of the general-21-10/5/82feeling of solidarity, a common problem, a common approach, and allthe rest. And the banks, of course, are distributed among all thesecountries, too, including some countries that are not involved, and weneed the support of the central banks in dealing with their own banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker discusses the inherent management difficulty in dealing with the current problems, including the large number of actors involved and their differing self-interests. The speaker also mentions the unequal voice and influence of different countries, which creates a problem. Overall, there is disagreement and difficulty in coordinating international cooperation in addressing these problems.


Passage number 180.
MR. WALLICH. I think a fairly persuasive way of answering aquestion about how all those countries are going to pay back all themoney is to say that basically these countries--and I'm speaking notof the East bloc--are viable. They can produce enough to take care oftheir needs. They may go through a difficult time, but it's aquestion of the policies that they pursue and, therefore, how they canbe influenced by the IMF rather than whether they can. It is possiblefor them to meet their obligations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich expresses his belief that these countries are viable and capable of producing enough to meet their obligations.


Passage number 181.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I agree with that; that's another way ofsaying the situation is manageable. But they all do have very heavydebt burdens. And it gets into political questions as well aseconomic questions at some point. The country may say "Is itworthwhile to meet them." whether they can or cannot theoretically.[The problem] is exponential for some of them; they have gotten sodeeply into debt. But, of course, in that sense, there is no questionthat lower interest rates, to the extent that is reflected in theirborrowing, are very important. For a country like Mexico or Braziltheir debt service--not their total debt service but their externalinterest payments for a year--are $10 billion plus.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 182.
MR. TRUMAN. $12 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple statement of an amount of money. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 183.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. $12 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 184.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And their exports are $20 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about the exports being $20 billion without any conflicting or contrasting information.


Passage number 185.
MR. BOEHNE. I have a question. You made the point earlierthat even with the drop in interest rates we've seen that very littlehas trickled down to the real problem cases because of the tiering onquality considerations. Just suppose that it were the view of theCommittee that an effort ought to be made to have a significant dropin rates. In your judgment, how much can we realistically expect thatit would trickle down to some of these countries who really need thiskind of relief, in light of the experience we've had in recent months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by Mr. Boehne seeking the opinion of the Committee member.


Passage number 186.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would not propose reducing interestrates simply as a method of getting their interest burden down. It'sa by-product there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is providing the author's opinion that reducing interest rates solely to decrease the interest burden is not a recommended approach.


Passage number 187.
MR. BOEHNE. I understand that. I was just asking--usingthat as a vehicle.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 188.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know that I can give you anadequate answer. I suppose the answer must be that it's going to bethat much less than it would otherwise be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty and stating that the answer is likely to be less than expected.


Passage number 189.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think the indirect effect on otherindustrialized countries' exchange rates and their ability to lowertheir interest rates, and the reversing if possible of the decline inthe real volume of world trade that is going on, would probably have abigger impact on the exports of, say, Mexico and Argentina and Brazil10/5/82than the direct reduction in the interest rate burden unless thatlower interest rate prevails over six months or a year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no obvious contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is presenting their thoughts on the potential impact of certain factors on the exports of Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil.


Passage number 190.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the more important thing wouldcertainly be a sense that there is at least enough money to lend here,given the bank liquidity incentive that they don't have now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses the opinion that having enough money to lend is important, particularly in the absence of bank liquidity incentive.


Passage number 191.
MR. GRAMLEY. Isn't the more basic problem that, in order forall of these countries around the world who have severe difficultyservicing their debts to find a way out, we simply can't rely oninternal adjustments within those countries to do it. We have to havesome world economic expansion. That's really a necessary conditionfor finding a way out of this whole problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not show any explicit contention or disagreement. It is a statement presenting a problem and suggesting a solution.


Passage number 192.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not disagreeing with the thrustof what you're saying. That is very important in setting the climateof the whole thing. But I don't think one can honestly say that someof these countries [around which] you could build a dike, are totallydependent on world economic conditions. I think of Yugoslavia orArgentina in particular, where the balance of payments is not in thatbad shape to start with. Wheat is a big export in Argentina; that'snot, I think, terribly sensitive to world economic conditions. Idon't mean to detract from your point about a climate of expansion;particularly for a country like Brazil, it's critically important.But I don't think one can argue that we can't deal with a lot of theseindividual situations without an absolute necessity of having strongworld economic expansion, although it obviously may [help].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges the importance of setting a climate of expansion and agrees with the general thrust of the argument being made. They simply provide some additional information and examples to support their point, without contradicting or arguing against the initial argument.


Passage number 193.
MR. GRAMLEY. No, I wasn't talking about strong [worldexpansion], and I would agree with your point on individual countries.But it's no longer a question of just one individual country and whatit does to get its problem solved. It is how all of them together aregoing to get out that I think requires some degree of economicexpansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. Mr. Gramley agrees with the point made by the other person and expresses a similar opinion about the need for collective economic expansion.


Passage number 194.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't disagree with your basic comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement explicitly states that there is no disagreement with the other person's basic comment.

There is no direct contention or disagreement in the passage as it consists of a statement by Mr. Partee without any opposing views or arguments presented.


Passage number 196.
MR. GRAMLEY. Indeed. I think growth of the U.S. economy andof the world economy is a necessary but not sufficient condition toget us out of this severe difficulty we find ourselves in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply expresses their opinion that the growth of the U.S. and world economy is necessary but not sufficient to solve the current difficulties.


Passage number 197.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On a global basis I don't disagree withyou.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 198.
MR. WALLICH. I'm sorry. I feel like turning it around andsaying it is a sufficient but not absolutely necessary condition. Wecan find equilibrium at the level of some degree of recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. Mr. Wallich disagrees with the idea that a recession is an absolutely necessary condition for finding equilibrium. He believes that equilibrium can be achieved at some degree of recession, but it is not the only factor.


Passage number 199.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, you're also assuming that wecan have a stable level of recession in the world.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating an assumption without conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 200.
MR. WALLICH. That is true. [The world economy] doesn't haveto keep going down all the time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage shows agreement as Mr. Wallich agrees with the statement that the world economy doesn't have to keep going down all the time.


Passage number 201.
MS. TEETERS. The political implications of that, Henry, insome of these other countries may be much more severe than they are10/5/82here. Put a country into a situation of restraint in order to correctits external debts and I think there is the potential for politicalupheaval.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the potential political implications of putting a country into a situation of restraint to correct its external debts.


Passage number 202.
MR. GUFFEY. Just a related question: Has our governmentalposture with respect to intervention in foreign exchange marketschanged at all. I noticed we did some purchases yesterday, as Samreported.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question about the change in the government's posture regarding intervention in foreign exchange markets.


Passage number 203.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a nice semantic question, I guess, ofwhether the attitude has changed or whether the circumstances havechanged. We are certainly intervening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is posing a semantic question about the change in attitude or circumstances and does not express or indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 204.
MR. FORD. Any pressures.

Passage number 205.
MR. GUFFEY. Not in any size [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the given passage, Mr. Guffey's statement is incomplete and contains unintelligible words. As a result, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 206.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not aggressively, no. We have this notterribly aggressive [unintelligible]. But I think the attitude tobegin with is that there is a concern about this repetitiveappreciation of the dollar and the dollar reaching levels that seem--SPEAKER(.). Overdone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement among the speakers. They seem to agree on the attitude towards the repetitive appreciation of the dollar.


Passage number 207.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --unusual, overdone, or whatever the rightword is. So, there is a more sympathetic climate. There is no greatfeeling, which I share, that this [intervention] is going torevolutionize the world in and of itself, by any means.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express contention or disagreement. It simply provides an opinion about the potential impact of an intervention, acknowledging that there is a more sympathetic climate towards it but also stating that it is not believed to have the power to revolutionize the world on its own.


Passage number 208.
 But that--MR. GUFFEY. That together with some lower interest rates mayhelp.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It states a potential solution or suggestion (lower interest rates) that may help with an unspecified issue. There is no conflicting viewpoint or opposing statement mentioned.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And at the very minimum that at leastreduces the [tensions] in international relations at a time when wedon't need any more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply suggests that reducing tensions in international relations would be beneficial, especially during a time when more tensions are not needed.


Passage number 210.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The loss of U.S. exports due to anuncompetitive exchange rate, as best as one can make rough estimates,has been estimated in work I've seen as the equivalent of 2 percent ofour GNP in real terms. I don't know what the staff here has.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply stating an estimation they have seen regarding the loss of U.S. exports.


Passage number 211.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, my question is whether or not there is arecognition by this government of that fact. And I assume the answeris, to a greater extent, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker's question is simply asking for confirmation of a fact, and they assume that the answer is yes.


Passage number 212.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but I don't want to suggest thatthere is great eagerness to intervene. It is a reluctant willingness.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Although there may be some hesitation or reluctance, there doesn't seem to be any contention or disagreement expressed in the passage. The statement is expressing a cautious willingness or openness to intervene.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 213.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There was a major surge in the dollaryesterday. To answer your question: I don't think there's anywillingness in this government to try to get the exchange rate valuedown in terms of levels. Given Paul's talks with the Secretary [ofthe Treasury], there may be a tad greater willingness to be in themarket on days when there are surges but not a [willingness to]sustain the effort, I don't think, to get the level down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses their belief that there is no willingness in the government to lower the exchange rate, but mentions the possibility of a slight increase in willingness to intervene in the market on days with surges. This suggests a disagreement or uncertainty in the government's actions regarding the exchange rate.


Passage number 214.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The statement "Not yet" does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 215.
10/5/82MR. WALLICH. Well, it's very doubtful that we can change the[exchange rate] level substantially unless there are policies thatsupport it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It states a skeptical view about changing the exchange rate level without supportive policies, but there is no disagreement between different parties or perspectives.


Passage number 216.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm afraid that this [discussion] isgetting a little ahead of us in some sense. I don't know whetherthere are any policies that support it now. There's something toDelors' statement that whatever happens, people want to go intodollars. In the long run obviously one can change that, but whetheror how changeable it is in the short run [involves] some fairly basicpremises. Germany may not be able to have a stable government becauseit is going to get polarized politically or the French may not be ableto manage their internal situation or whatever other concerns thereare in the exchange markets may change rapidly but are not amenable toobvious kinds of policy measures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It discusses various factors and uncertainties without taking a strong stance or expressing conflicting views.


Passage number 217.
MR. WALLICH. One would think that the market would observethe outlook for [some period] to come and tumble to the implicationsof that after a while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply states a hypothetical observation about how the market would react to a certain situation.


Passage number 218.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I just came back from Europe. I amstruck by the degree of malaise and of nervousness there--fears of allkind--and the willingness of players to move enormous sums of money toSwitzerland and the United States on gut instinct that things are justgoing wrong in Europe and that the future just doesn't look good forEurope. And, of course, this was happening even in Japan where thestatistics look better. There is a lot of money going out of Japan.And the exchange rate now is ridiculous; it's 270 yen for the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage describes the author's observation of malaise and nervousness in Europe, fears of uncertainty, and the movement of money to Switzerland and the United States. It also mentions similar occurrences in Japan. However, there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 219.
MR. MORRIS. Well, I find the same kind of attitude amongU.S. businessmen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker, Mr. Morris, finds a similar attitude among U.S. businessmen.


Passage number 220.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, that is pushing the money out[unintelligible] the world.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply affirming that money is being pushed out into the world.


Passage number 221.
MR. MORRIS. No, no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states "No, no" which indicates agreement or affirmation.


Passage number 222.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. All right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. "All right" is a phrase of agreement or acceptance and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 223.
MR. MORRIS. I am seeing an attitude that I have never seenbefore, not even in the depths of the 1974-75 recession. There is afeeling of apprehension, a vague apprehension that maybe things aregoing to get out of hand. And it's leading businessmen to take a verydefensive posture. I talked to the head of a quite successful companythat is being cushioned by a big increase in defense contracts. Butthe firm's domestic business is off, and he said--and I thought thiswas a rather striking statement--that the objective of his company wasto generate cash.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own observation and perspective about the current situation and the attitude of businessmen. They mention a conversation with the head of a successful company but do not present any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 224.
 If that kind of thinking is very widespread--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There's no question that that thinking iswidespread. Somebody was telling me the other day, a member of aninvestment banking firm, that he had visited a number of companies andwas struck by one fact. These companies were in various businesses.Obviously, everybody is affected by the business [situation] to agreater or lesser degree; these happened to be profitable companies.And at company after company, they were all building up cashliquidity. He was just amazed at the size of their cash balances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any statements that indicate contention or disagreement. It primarily presents observations and opinions without introducing conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 225.
10/5/82MR. MORRIS. So we shouldn't be surprised if liquid assetshave grown relative to nominal GNP at a rate that is out of line withpast experience.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of fact and does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply states that liquid assets have grown relative to nominal GNP at a rate that is unexpected based on past experience.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 226.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My mental image of the business world isthat those that are profitable are sitting on cash. Those that arenot profitable are being squeezed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The passage presents two contrasting statements about the business world. The first statement suggests that profitable businesses have ample cash reserves, while the second statement implies that unprofitable businesses are facing financial pressure. These two ideas create a sense of contention or disagreement regarding the financial positions of different businesses in the passage.


Passage number 227.
MR. KEEHN. But even with the profitable ones, the level ofmalaise is rising very dramatically.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage suggests that there is a significant increase in malaise, indicating a negative trend, but there is no explicit contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 228.
 So, I sense that with thepassage of time--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This isn't a comment that they are notexperiencing malaise; their sitting on cash is an indication of amalaise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply suggests that the fact that someone is "sitting on cash" can be seen as an indication of malaise.


Passage number 229.
MR. PARTEE. There is a sense of pull-backs, though. Do you,Si and Frank, get the sense that they are pulling back on theirspending plans in order to generate this cash.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question asking for the opinion of Si and Frank.


Passage number 230.
MR. MORRIS. Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The word "absolutely" is used to strongly agree with the previous statement, suggesting that there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 231.
MR. BALLES. Yes.SPEAKER(.). Universally.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 232.
MR. KEEHN. At Caterpillar, for example, they are not[unintelligible], but they are being particularly hard hit. Theirsales [in the third quarter] and their estimated sales in the fourthquarter of this year will be 50 percent under the sales for the thirdquarter of last year. That's a massive decrease. They went backthrough their records and the last time that they had a decrease wasin '29 and in '30. And then they had their first loss year-end '32.They're going to have another loss year this year, and they are at theend of their string.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating facts about Caterpillar's sales and financial situation without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 233.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Of course, the discouraging thing is thattheir workers are out on strike.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a statement of fact. It does not express any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 234.
 I don't know what they're askingfor, but--MR. KEEHN. Yes, but they are not posturing for negotiations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply mentions that the speaker doesn't know what someone is asking for, but supports it by saying they are not posturing for negotiations. This does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 235.
Their comments are based on their--MR. MARTIN. The point is the militancy in the unions despitethese realities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that the comments are based on something, but does not mention any contention or disagreement among the commenters.


Passage number 236.
MR. KEEHN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I'm unable to provide the answer you're looking for.


Passage number 237.
 Yes, the union is basing its position on '81results, which were pretty good comparatively, and they are notbeing--MR. PARTEE. That strike might run a long time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the union's position and then adding their own opinion about the potential duration of the strike. However, there is no indication of disagreement or conflict with another party.


Passage number 238.
MR. KEEHN. Also, Caterpillar is being killed by the yen-dollar rate. [A Japanese company] has just taken their ears off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states that Caterpillar is being negatively affected by the yen-dollar rate. The mention of a Japanese company taking their ears off could be seen as figurative language rather than a statement of disagreement.


Passage number 239.
MR. MORRIS. We're seeing in New England highly successful,very rapidly growing companies such as Digital Equipment being hit.They have had traditionally a "no layoff" policy; so they announced10/5/82that in order to substitute for the cash flow improvement of a layoffthey were going to have a wage freeze for 3 months. This really hitBoston. If Digital Equipment is in trouble, then the issue is: Whois doing well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Morris stating the situation of successful companies in New England, specifically Digital Equipment, and their decision to implement a wage freeze instead of layoffs.


Passage number 240.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I ran into a fellow the other day atdinner--unfortunately I think this is an atypical experience of amajor multi-national company with a foreign base with a big U.S.operation--and asked him how things were going and what hisinflationary expectations were and what else was happening. This guyis obviously quite conservative, but he said he had just come from ameeting of his American managers and the purpose of the meeting atleast in part was to decide upon what he called "merit increases" nextyear. It sounds like the Federal Reserve. He went around to themanagers and asked them what they thought was appropriate for meritincreases this year. They all gave him figures of 10 to 12 percent,and according to him he started off by saying: "Are you laying offworkers." And all the managers said "yes," they were laying employeesoff. He suggested to them that merit increases this year shouldaverage 3 percent so long as they were laying off workers. I said tohim: "Managers don't like to do that because it may affect their ownsalary scales. What did you do about that." He said: "Oh, I forgotto tell you. I told them they were getting zero." Unfortunately heis a Frenchman, not an American. I don't know how typical that is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contentious or disagreement in this passage. It is a conversation recounting a discussion about merit increases within a company and the decision to lay off workers.


Passage number 241.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. He didn't want to [unintelligible].I was shocked the other day when the head of one of the big insurancecompanies was in for lunch and said his company is giving wageincreases that average about 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply expresses surprise at the wage increases being given by a company.


Passage number 242.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Did you give him a lecture.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 243.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I did. I gave him a much strongerlecture than probably was politic. He apologized but gave me theargument that it's a catch-up because their workers' wages had fallenbehind. I don't know how true that is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The person speaking (the narrator) believes that they gave a stronger lecture than was appropriate, implying that they disagree with their own actions. Additionally, there is disagreement between the narrator and the person they are talking to regarding the reason for the catch-up in wages. The narrator expresses doubt about the truth of that argument.


Passage number 244.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Catch-up for the executives right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The given statement is a simple statement about executives catching up on something. It does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 245.
MR. PARTEE. Well, if they're not doing it in Boston, theinsurance business will shift to Boston from New York.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Partee about the potential shift of the insurance business from New York to Boston.


Passage number 246.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Maybe the new form of a viableincomes policy. Chuck, is to try to put constraints only on the [payof] top executives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply suggests the possibility of a new form of viable incomes policy, specifically focusing on constraining the pay of top executives.


Passage number 247.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing agreement with a statement made by someone else.


Passage number 248.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the name "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON" without providing any context or information that would suggest any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 249.
 If you do that, they'll see thatnobody else--MS. TEETERS. Like the Federal Reserve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing a hypothetical situation or advice without any conflicting views.


Passage number 250.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think there's something to that. Maybewe'll add that to our directive today. [Unintelligible] salarysurveys.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough context to determine if there is any contention or disagreement. It mostly consists of an individual expressing their thoughts and considering adding something to their directive. The mention of "salary surveys" does not indicate contention on its own.


Passage number 251.
-27-10/5/82MR. BOEHNE. I had a similar group in to our Bank--peoplefrom Philadelphia or nearby--and their figure wasn't 10 percent but 8percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that another group had a different figure than the one being discussed.


Passage number 252.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm surprised it's so common in thefinancial world; they give the same kind of argument. Well, whatother general comments are there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing surprise at the commonality of a certain argument in the financial world and then moves on to ask for other general comments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 253.
MR. CORRIGAN. With all this understandable talk about Mexicoand all the rest, you didn't say a word about small banks at the otherend of the spectrum. But I think it's relevant to this generalconversation. We started about four or five months ago carefullymonitoring the small banks in the Ninth District. The monitoringtakes several forms, including literally getting an instant picture ofan examination the minute it is completed, and we are compiling listsof one-bank holding companies [in difficulty]. The criteria that weused was that if a one-bank holding company will consume at least 75percent of the bank's 1981 earnings to meet its debt servicerequirements in 1982, it is on the list. It's really striking, to putit mildly, to see the number of institutions that fall into thatcategory in the case of the one-bank holding companies. The number issubstantial, and that of course assumes that they have the equivalentof 1981 earnings to work with in the future to meet these debt servicerequirements at the holding company level. With the problem loans andthe loan losses and this new instrument and all the rest, one could atleast question the proposition that they're going to be able to retainthose earnings. Similarly, in the case of small banks, at least theones that seem to be scattered around the Ninth District, it's notuncommon to see that the classified loans in the recent examinationversus the last one are up anywhere from 200 to 500 percent. As ofyet most of that increase is in the commercial sector and the MainStreet retailers. There is not yet a major increase in the problemloans reflecting the agricultural sector itself. But one has towonder how long that can last, given what is going on right now.The other thing that I would observe in terms of these smalland medium size banks that I think is directly relevant to what wassaid earlier is that it is rather astonishing to me to see the extentto which these regional and small institutions have money placed inthe London market. There are very logical and natural reasons whythey should do that, and certainly we don't want to chase that moneyout of there right now. Nevertheless, it is a form of exposure evenin these banking organizations that ties in with this internationalsituation and goes in many cases well beyond our general perceptions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Corrigan, raises concerns about the potential financial difficulties faced by small banks and one-bank holding companies. He questions whether these institutions will be able to retain their earnings and suggests that the increase in classified loans may eventually extend to the agricultural sector. He also expresses astonishment at the extent to which these banks have money placed in the London market, highlighting the exposure to international factors. Overall, Mr. Corrigan's observations suggest a skepticism about the financial stability of small banks and the potential risks they face.


Passage number 254.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This situation is exposing, in my view,the structural weaknesses in the banking world of which thesemotherless banks are one example. But this kind of thing is anotherthat gets these small banks in that kind of a market. The problems inthe Eurodollar market to which I alluded are not confined to Americanbanks by any means. North of the border, they have had problems inspades domestically and that has not gone unnoticed in internationalmarkets, and one can make the same comments about some banks in otherareas.If we are ready, I think we ought to return to the policydiscussion. The staff can distribute this draft text that I have fordiscussion purposes anyway. I have not read [the directive] probably-2810/5/82literally for years; I don't know whether I've read it since I've beenhere. But for some reason I got this boilerplate part in front of me,which goes in front of the [operative part of the] directive, and itseems to me singularly inappropriate. It probably always is, but itis more so now. I think this could use a judicious sentence or two,making some allusion to the strains or pressures or whatever in thebanking sector these days and to the problems of foreign lending inparticular--it needs to be expressed very judiciously--just toindicate that we are someplace in the real world. And I would suggestthat it might possibly be left to the Chairman to figure out asentence or two to stick in there at an appropriate point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion on the weaknesses in the banking world and suggesting a change in the policy discussion, but there is no direct disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 255.
MR. FORD. I beg your pardon. I don't understand whereyou're going to add a sentence or two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply shows one person expressing confusion and seeking clarification, but there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 256.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not quite sure where I would putit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses uncertainty or indecisiveness about where to put something.


Passage number 257.
MS. TEETERS. What are you looking at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 258.
MR. PARTEE. He's talking about the first several paragraphsin the directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It consists of a statement referring to the topic of discussion but does not provide any details or arguments that suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 259.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm talking about something called thegeneral paragraphs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention anything about contention or disagreement, it is simply introducing the topic of "general paragraphs."


Passage number 260.
MR. PARTEE. It's probably on the calm side; it's bland.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply describes something as calm and bland.


Passage number 261.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's the first paragraph he's talkingabout.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply stating a fact about the topic being discussed.


Passage number 262.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm talking about the first twoparagraphs. I think [the additional sentences] would go appropriatelyeither at the bottom of the first page or in the top paragraph on thesecond page.

Passage number 281.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know what the Act particularlyrequires, but if we change the annual target rather specifically, thenI think we would report it. I would not interpret this that way.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 294.
MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, why would this be preferable tocontinuing to specify the target for M1 but putting in a disclaimer orat least the warning that M1 might behave in an unusual manner and ifthat occurs, we would reserve the privilege of adjusting itaccordingly. I'd prefer that for the sake of continuity. If weignore M1 totally, despite the explanations that are given, I thinkpeople could read sinister purposes in it; it would make base driftpale in comparison to dropping one of our important targets totally.I'd rather see us say that we're doing this but it is somewhattentative due to what might happen on these new instruments. Toignore M1 would really run the flag up that in some people'sperception we are making a basic change. There is still a significantamount of debate between Frank and me and others; some of us thinkthat M1 is not as unreliable as others do. I just think to drop itwould look as though we've really retreated in that regard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Roos, is expressing disagreement with the idea of completely ignoring M1 and suggests instead to include a disclaimer or warning about the potential unusual behavior of M1.

He also mentions that there is ongoing debate between him and others about the reliability of M1.


Passage number 295.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I don't think there should be anyimplication here of more than a one-quarter problem. It may be morethan that, but this isn't meant to carry any implication of that. ButI would like to separate the substance from the presentation. Insubstance what I feel very strongly about is that it would be amistake to have any kind of directive that would drive us deliberatelyor otherwise to higher interest rates. I think it was a mistake tohave that kind of directive last time. I think it would be more thana mistake this time, and it's not going to be acceptable to me.Beyond that it is desirable to get some easing in this situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. The speaker shares their opinion and expresses their strong feelings about not having any kind of directive that would lead to higher interest rates. There is no conflicting viewpoint or opposition mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 296.
MR. ROOS. Well, doesn't alternative B for M1 as shown in theBluebook imply roughly that the fed funds rate would remain in the 8to 12 percent range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about the implication of alternative B for M1.


Passage number 297.
 In other words, how would this avoid--10/5/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me clarify my comment. A 12 percentfederal funds rate currently is totally unacceptable to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing a personal opinion without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 298.
MR. MARTIN. That's the top of the range for "B.

Passage number 302.
 But even so, I think you have to recognize,Larry, that the staff hasn't factored in the possibility--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The central point is that whatever the[monetary variable] is that we are operating on, it is a staff guess,which may or may not be right. I'm saying that I am not willing tostake my life, so to speak, on that guess being right. The risks aretoo great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about not wanting to rely solely on the staff's guess, stating that the risks are too great. However, there is no indication of disagreement or contention with anyone else.


Passage number 303.
MR. ROOS. How would this give you greater assurance, Mr.Chairman, that rates could not [rise].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked for clarification or further information.


Passage number 304.
 For example, if some peoplefelt through some complicated thinking that ignoring M1 was anexpansionary or inflationary act, how would this wording assure thatthe fed funds rate would not increase just as substantially as settinga "B" target for M1, for example, and saying it might be right orwrong depending on how people respond to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't want to respond to the particularwording at this point. Obviously, we have to get into that. But whatthis is meant to convey is an operational approach that modestly movesthe federal funds rate down. Whether it involves a discount ratechange or not is something the Board is going to have to decide. Butthat is the tenor meant to be given here, rather straightforwardly, Imight say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing a hypothetical scenario and expressing their intention for a certain operational approach.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 305.
MS. HORN. Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage begins with "MS. HORN" suggesting that there are two individuals involved, Ms. Horn and another person, who are likely engaging in some form of conversation or dialogue.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 306.
 Chairman, this indicates your dissatisfactionwith the way we handled it last time--that is, to have a target thatwas sensitive to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I am totally dissatisfied. What wedid last time was unacceptable to me. I just want to make that plain.I think we made a mistake last time. I think we would not have sodifficult a problem psychologically this time if we had not done whatwe did last time. It wasn't that big a mistake in some sense. Butit's unfortunate that we ended up at this meeting with the federalfunds rate and private rates about 1 percentage point higher than theywere at the time of the last meeting because we had a high M1 figurein September. That was the only reason it happened.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The chairman expresses dissatisfaction with the way things were handled in the past, stating that it was unacceptable and a mistake. The statement "What we did last time was unacceptable to me" indicates disagreement or contention.


Passage number 307.
MR. WALLICH. There was still some hope then that we couldget within the target ranges for the year. This time it looks verydoubtful that without a self-defeating effort we would get M1 withinits target range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 308.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not going to cry over last month'sdecision. All I'm saying is, looking ahead, that I don't want to endup a month from now with a 12 percent federal funds rate. I don'teven want to end up with an 11 percent federal funds rate, based upon10/5/82everything I know about the market situation, the national situation,and the world situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's preference and concern about the federal funds rate based on their knowledge of various situations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 309.
MR. FORD. What you are saying quite plainly, if I hear youcorrectly, is that you think rates are too high now and you don't wanteven a tiny increase from the present rate of 10-1/4 percent on thefed funds rate. You don't want it averaging 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The passage indicates that Mr. Ford disagrees with the idea of any increase in the fed funds rate, expressing his belief that the rates are already too high. This implies a contention or disagreement regarding the desired course of action regarding interest rates.


Passage number 310.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I surely do not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 311.
MR. FORD. You want literally to cap interest rates wherethey are now, or better yet, to drive them down.

Passage number 312.
MR. PARTEE. To a 10 percent top.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 314.
MR. FORD. I want to say, respectfully, that I'm flatlyopposed to this. If we were to do this, especially now, I think itwill consolidate any adverse opinions against us that are already outthere about our motives for doing this at this particular time. At abreakfast meeting with the leading bankers in Atlanta 72 hours or soago, at which Mayor Young was the guest of honor speaking to us, hevolunteered in front of all the bankers in the room a comment--we werediscussing the city's problems--that he was instructing his staff toissue some municipal bonds immediately in order to do a certainproject in the city of Atlanta. I said: "What's the rush about this,Andy." And he said: "You guys are going to change policy right afterelection day and now is the time to do it." This was Andrew Young.I've heard from more people than I care to describe to you commentsquestioning our integrity and our motives in the context of anelection campaign.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Ford, expresses his opposition to a certain action and states that it will consolidate adverse opinions against them. He mentions comments questioning their integrity and motives.


Passage number 315.
MR. MORRIS. Yes, but Bill, we've got to do what we think isbest for the economy and let those comments go.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Morris and Bill seem to be on the same page and prioritize the economy over personal comments.


Passage number 316.
MR. FORD. First of all, I'm not convinced that pegginginterest rates at today's level or trying to push them down is bestfor the economy. Secondly, changing policy now in this context andsaying overtly, as you said it, that we should hold interest rateswhere they are and try to push them down is going to make us extremelyvulnerable to charges--unfounded I feel, because I don't question themotives of the people here who would vote for this. I think therepercussions of this are going to be terrible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and concerns, but there is no mention of any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 317.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's an enormous concession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply expresses that something is a significant or large concession.


Passage number 318.
MR. FORD. People are going to come down all over us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that people will have opinions about or judgments towards "us" (presumably Mr. Ford and others).


Passage number 319.
MR. PARTEE. You know, Bill, I would put the emphasis alittle differently here. Maybe the wording needs to be changed some;I wouldn't put it in terms of moving interest rates down. I think theproblem is that M1 could do almost anything in the period to come. Infact, it already has done almost anything. In August and September wehad a 35 percent rate of increase in NOW accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is suggesting a different emphasis or wording for a statement, but there is no direct disagreement with anyone else's opinion or statement.


Passage number 320.
 And that's notassociated with the--10/5/82MR. FORD. I'm not trying to defend M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their position and clarifying that they are not trying to defend something.


Passage number 321.
MR. PARTEE. Our problem, though, is not just that the numbermight be 1/2 percent too high; it might be way too high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply presents a potential problem without taking a position or opposing view.


Passage number 322.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We may have a $10 billion increase in M1in the first week in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a factual statement about a potential increase in M1 money supply in the first week of October. There is no disagreement or contention expressed in the statement.


Passage number 323.
MR. PARTEE. So, I support the idea of getting off M1 at thisparticular time. Perhaps there is more emphasis on it than thereought to be here. It really doesn't come through as strongly when onereads this [draft directive language] that we're trying to moveinterest rates down as when the Chairman talks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, expresses his support for the idea of getting off M1, but also suggests that there may be more emphasis on it than necessary. He does not contradict or disagree with the Chairman's statement.


Passage number 324.
MR. FORD. I'm reacting to what the Chairman is telling us,which is I think commendably honest, in that he is saying he reallydoesn't want to see interest rates raised. That's what I'm reactingto regardless of what it says here. And I think that will be apparentin the marketplace well before this is published and our integritywill be brought into question if we proceed along that line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the Chairman's statement and expressing concern about the potential consequences of raising interest rates.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Your vision of our integrity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 326.
MR. FORD. My vision, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Ford is simply stating his vision without any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 327.
MR. ROOS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as no conflicting viewpoints or arguments are presented.


Passage number 328.
 Even if this were done, people will still measureM1 in their closets and under their beds and so forth in order to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We haven't suggested that we won't publishthe number, Larry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is purely an explanation of people's behavior and does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 329.
MR. ROOS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unfortunately, without the specific passage, I am unable to provide a response. Please provide the relevant passage for a proper analysis.


Passage number 330.
 If, in order to keep interest rates artificiallydown or otherwise down, we have to inflate M1, the minute that becomesapparent we've lost the ballgame and we will have just as high--MR. PARTEE. We're not inflating it. I think youmisunderstand. These are structural shifts that are occurring thatpossibly are going to produce a much higher M1 for a time. And thequestion is: Should we resist it, which inevitably would mean higherrates, or should we recognize that there has been a structural shift.Would we be better off not looking at it so much for a little while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. Both speakers are discussing different perspectives on whether to resist or acknowledge a possible structural shift that could result in higher M1 and interest rates. However, they are not directly arguing against each other's viewpoints.


Passage number 331.
MR. ROOS. Well, how does this differ, Chuck, from ourexperience with NOW accounts. I remember when everybody got all jumpyabout NOW accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roos is simply asking Chuck about the difference between the current situation and the past experience with NOW accounts.


Passage number 332.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I think NOW accounts are causing us anawful lot of trouble.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 333.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. I think we probably havenot adjusted for NOW accounts correctly. The total growth in M1,almost, has been in NOW accounts this year. To what extent does thatreflect real money. Who knows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Instead, the speaker is expressing uncertainty and skepticism about whether NOW accounts accurately reflect real money growth.


Passage number 334.
MR. WALLICH. I think we have to detach temporarily from M1because it has become so uncertain both because of the all saverscertificates bulge and the new instrument coming along. Even if thatbulge were not to occur, we would have the new instrument and we10/5/82simply don't know [its likely effect]; all we know is that it could bevery major. We can put more stress on the evidence of risingliquidity preference, and that gives us the opportunity to target onM2 with a proviso that if it exceeds [our expectations], we'll takethis as evidence of an increase in liquidity preference and not followup with interest rates. That seems to me perfectly defensiblesubstantively and still within the formal framework of our policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing a strategy for detaching temporarily from M1 and targeting M2 instead. They acknowledge the uncertainty around the new instrument and the potential increase in liquidity preference. The speaker presents their strategy as a defensible approach.


Passage number 335.
MR. MARTIN. I'd like to turn the integrity argument aroundand argue for the second thoughts of the commentators and the analystsof our policy. If we move in this direction of minimizing oreliminating M1 temporarily--and I'm not ready to throw it overboard--and we pursue a policy that deliberately brings down interest rates,the first thoughts will be that we caved in, the election is coming,and here they go again. The second thoughts, I think, will bedifferent. The second thoughts--which may be based on some analysisrather than on a knee-jerk reaction to what we do--would be that theintegrity of the Federal Reserve is that they pursued policies with aneye to the growth of the economy, to the liquidity of the domestic andinternational system, and indeed, they did this despite the politicalconsequences that occurred in the short run. They maintained theirintegrity as a central bank. I think that's a very differentconclusion from the second thoughts on the other side which might bethat the Federal Reserve should have brought interest rates down butthe politics of the situation were such that they couldn't.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting his own argument and discussing the potential reactions and thoughts of commentators and analysts. He does not mention or engage with any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 336.
MR. ROOS. Well, who has been able to demonstrate anyreliable relationship between the growth of the broader aggregates andeconomic activity. M2 was growing way above its range last year, Ithink, or the year before and the economy was sick.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 337.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Milton Friedman wrote a big book on thesubject.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Milton Friedman wrote a book on a certain subject.


Passage number 338.
MR. ROOS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 339.
 I can't read, but--MR. PARTEE. It is certainly true that velocity has beenincreasing for M2 but not as much as for M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply presents a statement about the increase in velocity for M2 compared to M1.


Passage number 340.
MR. ROOS. Do you think the evidence shows that M2 is as gooda predictor as Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation:
There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for an opinion about the evidence.


Passage number 341.
MR. PARTEE. No, as M1 used to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that M1 used to be something without providing any contradictory statements or arguments.


Passage number 342.
MR. MARTIN. But this is short run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Martin is simply making a statement.


Passage number 343.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends upon which analyst looks at it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is not expressing any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that the interpretation or assessment of a given situation will vary depending on the individual analyst that examines it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 344.
MR. WALLICH. We have made that switch, though not quite asexplicitly; nevertheless, we've made it from time to time. We haveplaced more weight on M2 at times.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The phrase "though not quite as explicitly" suggests that there may be some disagreement or contention about the switch being made. Additionally, the use of the phrase "from time to time" implies inconsistency or variability in the decision-making process.


Passage number 345.
MS. HORN. It seems to me that the [appropriate] timing mightbe the next meeting. In terms of setting quarterly targets, we mightlook at an M1 target and tolerate above target performance [now], withall saver certificates and so forth coming due. And then at the nextmeeting if we are looking at an instrument that is very unpredictablein terms of what it's going to do to M1--having set the quarterly-35-10/5/82targets at this meeting--we could say that for some weeks during thispart of the quarter we're going to have to look more heavily at M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing possible timing for setting quarterly targets and considering different factors that may affect the decision.


Passage number 346.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 347.
MR. GUFFEY. Let me first of all say that I agree with theproposal that rates shouldn't go higher, that they should be in someway capped from this point forward for some period of time. Indeed,they should be urged to come down, not precipitously but in a modestway, over the quarter. But having said that, I look at the languagethat you have put before us and am trying to equate that with what thestaff has in the Bluebook. It seems to me that the 8-1/2 to 9-1/2percent range for M2--or at least the "A" proposal [of 9-1/2 percent]--and then the caveat in the last sentence would suggest that we willtolerate growth above that given some perception of liquidity needs orotherwise. I'm suggesting that in my view at least--and I will ask aquestion of Steve in a moment--that probably will result in ratescoming down immediately following this meeting, depending upon how webuild the path. And I would hesitate to associate myself with thosewho would want a fast drop in rates. If that's not a correctassessment, I would like to ask Steve: How would you build your pathfor the reserve objective based upon this kind of language. And whatwould you expect to happen within the next two weeks. That is rathera critical period for us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Guffey expresses agreement with the proposal to cap rates and have them come down, but raises concerns about the language and suggests that it could result in an immediate drop in rates, which he does not support.


Passage number 348.
MR. AXILROD. Well, with this kind of language, I would takeM2 growth at somewhere around 9 or 9-1/2 percent or whatever theCommittee sets and project the M1 that is roughly consistent withthat, which by the Bluebook [estimates] would be on the order of 5percent, forgetting these special circumstances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their own perspective on how to analyze the data and projecting the M1 growth rate. There is no contradictory viewpoint mentioned.


Passage number 349.
 So, if we assumesubstantial increases in the first week of October and take theborrowing that the Committee says to take--MR. GUFFEY. Well, it is important where we're going to setthe initial borrowing level; that is critical to what happens tointerest rates in the next two weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the importance of setting the initial borrowing level and how it will impact interest rates in the next two weeks.


Passage number 350.
MR. AXILROD. Well, that would be the Committee's decision.But consistent with some easing, one would assume that the initialborrowing assumption would be down [to] about $200 million, movingback toward where it was at the last meeting and probably a littlelower because that initial borrowing assumption is really pushing tomove the funds rate back above the discount rate. So, in partdepending on the sense of what the Committee wants, it may be belowthat level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Axilrod explaining that the initial borrowing assumption would be lowered.


Passage number 351.
MR. GUFFEY. I guess that sort of makes my point. I'minterested in the rates coming down and not going up, but I wouldobject to seeing a precipitous drop built upon this kind of path. Itoccurs to me that we may have fed funds trading in the 8-1/2 to 9percent range rather quickly if we're going to set that kind ofinitial borrowing level and these kinds of targets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own thoughts and concerns about the potential decrease in interest rates. They mention the possibility of interest rates trading in a specific range, but there is no disagreement with anyone else's viewpoint.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 352.
MR. AXILROD. Well, at the 10 percent discount rate, if youhad a borrowing of $200 million, just to take an example--I'm notsaying it should be at that level--I would not expect the funds rateto get as low as that. It would be more like 10 percent or a shadeunder. Peter may have another view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod is indicating that he does not expect the funds rate to get as low as a 10 percent discount rate, while Peter may have a different view.


Passage number 353.
10/5/82MR. STERNLIGHT. I would agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that Mr. Sternlight agrees with something, but it does not imply any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 354.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might remind you of the probable settingin the next few days. Indications are that we will have a very sharpdecline in the money supply for the last figure that means anything.And we probably will have an unemployment rate well over 10 percentpublished this week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating likely future events and potential statistics.


Passage number 355.
MR. ROOS. You said a decline in the money supply.SPEAKER(.). In the week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 356.
MR. GUFFEY. Those money numbers are not going to last exceptfor the one week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement about the duration of the money numbers.


Passage number 357.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, but that is the last number that willhave no distortion from all savers certificates in it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing a statement about a specific number without any indication of disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 358.
MR. PARTEE. Steve, in setting the path now, wouldn't youregard a change or a shift in the relationship between M1 and M2 thatyou could identify as coming in a week or two or three sort of as amultiplier adjustment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for Steve's opinion on a possible change or shift in the relationship between M1 and M2.


Passage number 359.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, if the Committee were adopting this sortof directive, those variations in M1 would all tend to be allowed foras multiplier adjustments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Axilrod is simply stating a hypothetical situation and explaining the potential outcomes of adopting a certain directive.


Passage number 360.
MR. PARTEE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided, hence it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 361.
MR. AXILROD. That would be the logic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any form of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a statement made by Mr. Axilrod without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas being expressed.


Passage number 362.
MR. PARTEE. So, it would depend on the setting of theinitial borrowing level, but it might not in fact result in a bigdecline in borrowing. It would depend on their relationship as to howmany nonborrowed reserves you provide.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is presenting a conditional statement and explaining that the outcome (a big decline in borrowing) would depend on the initial borrowing level and the relationship between nonborrowed reserves and borrowing.


Passage number 363.
MR. GUFFEY. But we are at a borrowing level of about $500 or$600 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states a borrowing level of $500 or $600 million.


Passage number 364.
MR. AXILROD. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states that Mr. Axilrod agrees with something, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 365.
MR. GUFFEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 366.
 And if you're going to build the path on $200million--MR. AXILROD. No, I was using that as an example.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is using a hypothetical scenario or example.


Passage number 367.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have to decide what to build the pathon. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement that a decision needs to be made about what to build the pathon. The mention of Mr. Black is unrelated to the question of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 368.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we are all in agreement on only onething, I think: that we would like to see interest rates come down.I would like to raise the question of whether it might not bereasonable to suppose that a little resistance now to the strengthwe've had in the aggregates might not save us from a bigger move lateron. We have engineered a pretty sharp reduction, almost 400 basispoints, in the federal funds rate from its level back in July.Historically when we've had that [kind of decline], we've had anexplosion of the aggregates. And if that does happen--though, of-37-10/5/82course, all of us hope it doesn't--we may find ourselves in a positionwhere we are going to have to move against that. We have justfinished a discussion of countries that have delayed taking wise stepsand they have gotten to the point where they have to take very drasticsteps. I have a whole collection of quotations from members of theBoard of Governors who have stated very eloquently that this is thepoint at which we've lost it, usually, in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black raises the question of whether resisting the current strength in the aggregates (economic indicators) would be beneficial in preventing a larger problem in the future. This suggests a different perspective or opinion from others who may advocate for further reduction in interest rates.


Passage number 369.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You won't find that quotation from me.There was a quotation to that effect cited at this meeting before,which I must correct for the record. I have said upon a number ofoccasions that the way we have lost this game is by staying with anexpansionary policy too long during a recovery period. That statementalso says the mistakes were not made at the bottom of a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is correcting a previous quotation and restating their own position on the topic.


Passage number 370.
MR. BLACK. Okay. Well, it may be a delay of timing, but I'mnot going to quarrel with you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Black states that he is not going to quarrel with the other person. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 371.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's rather significant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 372.
MR. BLACK. My feeling is that we can't pay too muchattention to the aggregates right now but that we ought to nudge thefederal funds rate [up] a little as a way of showing that we'reconcerned about that. I don't expect that to have much effect. But Ithink it could keep us from having to move [rates] a whole lot lateron, which really would worry me a great deal. But maybe I am deadwrong on this. It may be that the aggregates will come into line verybeautifully and we will have no worries. That would be the best ofall possible worlds. But that's not what I think is the most likelycase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their own thoughts and concerns about the situation, but there is no opposing viewpoint or argument being presented.


Passage number 373.
 So, I'm opposed to what you have suggested here, although Iunderstand full well how a reasonable person could be expected to--MR. RICE. Do I understand that you want to nudge the fundsrate up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that they understand how a reasonable person could support the suggestion but states that they are personally opposed to it.


Passage number 374.
MR. BLACK. A little. I wanted to do that between the lastmeeting and this meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that the speaker ("Mr. Black") desired to do something between two meetings.


Passage number 375.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions Governor Gramley without any further context or information to indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 376.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I think the period ahead is one in whichwe have ample reasons not to target on M1. My own judgment, however,is that the problem we face is much more fundamental than whether wetarget on M1 now because of all savers certificates and the new DIDCregulations that will come out as mandated by legislation. I thinkthe world economy is literally starved for liquidity. And I'd likenthis [situation] to the dietary analogy that suggests. Fat peoplehave good reasons to go on diets. Diets are very good things unlessthey get out of hand. They sometimes do. And when they get out ofhand, the patient becomes anorexic and that's often a fatal disease.If it's not fatal, it's often a life-long disease. I am worried thatwe have gone on long enough starving the world economy for liquidityand that we may be at a point of impending anorexia.Larry Roos mentioned earlier that he thought real interestrates were getting down toward normal levels. I must say I don't knowhow he reaches that conclusion. The three-month commercial paper rateis 10 percent, and my perception is that the three-month expected10/5/82inflation rate would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 to 5percent. So that makes the cost of issuing commercial paper 4 to 6percent in real terms. Private corporate bond rates for AAA issuesare 13-1/2 percent and are much higher for lower-graded issues. Iunderstand that most businesses now have a 5-to-10 year inflationexpectation of something like 6 to 7 percent .So that makes 6 to 7percent the long-term real interest rate. That simply isn't normal.It is not even close to being normal. There are all kinds of reasonsfor that, and I think fiscal policy is one of them. But if you lookat what has been happening to the real money stock recently, I thinkyou will find the answer largely in a very, very tight monetarypolicy. And it started before October 1979; it started earlier. In1979, we had an increase in the nominal money stock of 7-1/2 percent;prices went up above 12 percent. In 1980, nominal money went up 7-1/2percent; prices again went up around 11 to 12 percent. In 1981, moneygrowth was 5 percent against a price increase of 10 percent. Thisyear it will be a little closer probably. But we've had a very, verysubstantial drop in the real money stock in this country. It hasforced the kinds of policies other countries are following. So, Ithink we have to do what is necessary to provide the liquidity thatwill permit this economy to grow and will permit the world economy togrow. I think we're right in going in the direction we are at thisparticular meeting of unhinging [policy] from what is likely to happento M1 in the months ahead. I am wondering as I look at this directiveif the last two sentences are necessary. This leaves the directivefocused on expanding bank reserves as necessary for an orderly andsustained flow of money and credit and that leads to an expectationabout M2 and M3, without these last two sentences about somewhatslower and somewhat [more rapid]--I'm sorry, I think I'm losing myvoice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 377.
MR. PARTEE. I think the last sentence particularly raisesquestions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any evidence of contention or disagreement. It only states that the last sentence raises questions without any indication of a conflicting viewpoint or argument.


Passage number 378.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Based on the given passage, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement as the passage abruptly ends with "Mr. Corrigan" and does not provide any context or additional information.


Passage number 379.
MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, I clearly would fall on the sideof the argument that says we don't want an increase in interest rates,even by accident. An increase in interest rates in the currentsetting, even if it came about by accident, would border almost onbeing irresponsible at this point. On the other side, I'd like tothink that maybe we could orchestrate a moderate and temperate andfurther gradual reduction in market interest rates. In the currentcircumstances that inevitably calls into question relationships aboutthe discount rate and our view about what frictional levels ofborrowing really are, much as they did back in July when the lastreduction of the discount rate took place. But having said that, Iwould be somewhat uneasy to find ourselves in a situation where we aredealing with an unbridled attempt to force down interest rates asopposed to trying to nudge or orchestrate them in that direction. So,in general, I have no great problem with what is being suggested here.I would just throw out the idea, and I'm not sure how to do it, thatone way we might dissipate some of the concern about the longer-runimplications of this--or stated the other way, reinforce the view thatit is a temporary thing--would be to put a sentence in the directivesomeplace that makes at least oblique reference to a continuinglonger-run commitment to achieve moderate and declining monetarygrowth, perhaps in the context of the '83 targets or something like10/5/82that. It's not easy to do. But it might help deal with thisperception problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing his own opinion and thoughts about the topic but does not contradict or argue against any other perspective or viewpoint.


Passage number 380.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any kind of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 381.
MS. TEETERS. My views are well known, so I can be very[brief]. I don't think we can get a recovery with interest rateswhere they are, and I am very disappointed that they went back upsince the last meeting. I had hoped that they would go through the 9to 9-1/2 percent level and maybe go down again. Therefore, I wouldsupport anything that is going to bring us a generally lower ratestructure and bring mortgage rates and other long-term rates down andgin up the economy not only here but worldwide. So, I'm in favor ofthis. I don't object to those two last sentences. I think they givethe directive a very good flavor by saying that we're going to operatein the interest of liquidity in the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their disappointment with the increase in interest rates but agrees with the idea of bringing down rates to stimulate the economy.


Passage number 382.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unless the full passage is provided, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. Please provide the complete passage for an accurate analysis.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 383.
MR. MARTIN. I would join with Governors Partee and Teetersin the view that the impending recovery is probably not as projected,given today's interest rates. I would call your attention to therather heroic assumption, in current dollars, of the recovery inresidential structures quarter-by-quarter running between plus 24percent and plus almost 40 percent. Given today's interest rates andtoday's lack of liquidity in the financial system, I simply don't feelthat those are obtainable growth numbers. If that's part of theconsumer leading the recovery, it is not likely to occur. Much moreimportant is the weakness in business fixed investment; it is toostrong as projected. The first thing corporations have to do is toreliquify themselves; they're going to have to raise $20 billion or$40 billion or $60 billion in a very short period of time. Andthey're not likely to be able to do that in an economy with the degreeof liquidity it has today. It appears that there are notuncertainties anymore but fear out there in the capital markets. Partof it is derived from the international situation but a good deal ofit is the awareness of the precarious nature of our own privatecorporate sector in this country. And I think the need forreliquification extends very obviously to the thrift industry and tothe small banking industry as they face the changes that need to bemade there. But to get back to business investment, which I think isgoing to decline more than our projections show, corporations facevery low returns on investment after taxes despite the efforts of theCongress to change the depreciation and the cost recovery situation.As we know, the recently enacted tax revenue measure has taken backhalf of the benefits, plus or minus, in that area. So, we face anextended period of weakness in business investment.I think the best thing we can do is to bring rates down andhelp reliquify so that sometime out in 1983 or even 1984 we will havea recovery in the private sector. I would support a temporary movingaway from an M1 target. I believe that is consonant with maintainingour integrity as a central bank. We would be making a real mistake ifwe become too mechanical in the application of a policy in a multi-trillion dollar economy. So, I would like to see this directive,perhaps with the Corrigan codicil adding language pointing toward thereduction in the growth of the money supply over time. I would alsolike to see a borrowing level of $200 to $300 million with a verbal10/5/82directive, if you will, that interest rates be brought down, but in agradual way, echoing a previous comment here. [Unintelligible] thatwe temporarily target interest rates and that we be overt and candidin our specifications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident when Mr. Martin argues that the projected recovery is not feasible given the current interest rates and lack of liquidity in the financial system, while others may have a different view. He also disagrees with the projected strength of business fixed investment and suggests that corporations will struggle to raise the necessary funds in the current economic environment. Additionally, he proposes a temporary move away from an M1 target, which may be a point of contention with others who may advocate for a different approach.


Passage number 384.
MR. ROOS. During that temporary period, may I just inquirewhether we would continue to publish weekly M1 figures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not expressing any disagreement or contention. It is simply asking a question or inquiring about publishing weekly M1 figures during a temporary period.


Passage number 385.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Of course.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The word "of course" indicates that the following statement is something that is likely agreed upon or accepted without argument.


Passage number 386.
MR. MARTIN. Yes, indeed, unless we can get the four-weeknumbers published one of these days in addition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin's statement is a simple affirmation or agreement.


Passage number 387.
MR. ROOS. Pres, what if those weekly figures over thistemporary period showed a rather unusual and alarming increase in M1.They would be out there for everyone to see. Do you anticipate thatif that were to happen we would be able to move interest rates down.In other words, if the consequence of what we were doing[unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Roos is simply asking President (Pres) if, in the event of an unusual and alarming increase in M1, the interest rates could be lowered.


Passage number 388.
 The traditional means of bringing short-terminterest rates down was to pump money into the economy, and if thatwas reflected in the weekly figures and they showed a bulge, assumingthat everyone around this table wants to see lower interest rates--MR. MARTIN. Larry, this is not the problem here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is simply stating that the problem being discussed is not related to the traditional means of bringing down interest rates.


Passage number 389.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This isn't the problem, I'm afraid. Thosefigures may show a bulge and it may have nothing to do with pumpingmoney into the economy. It may show a bulge because $22 billion ofall savers certificates are maturing, some of which are temporarilybeing lodged in M1. Now, what do you do with that figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the author is providing an explanation for a potential bulge in figures related to the economy. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 390.
MS. TEETERS. We go out with an announcement telling thepublic what happened.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward statement of what the speaker plans to do.


Passage number 391.
MR. MARTIN. We would explain it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin is stating that they would explain something.


Passage number 392.
MR. ROOS. Well, I would suspect, and I'd be prepared toplace a small wager on it, that the all savers phenomenon will washitself out within 60 days at the most.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 393.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explicitly states agreement with the statement.


Passage number 394.
MR. PARTEE. Then in 60 days we will have a new instrument.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any statements that indicate contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward statement without any conflicting or contradictory elements.


Passage number 395.
MR. MARTIN. In the meantime, John Deere fails.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 396.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Of course it will wash itself out. Thatparticular phenomenon will wash itself out in less than 60 days.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses certainty that the phenomenon in question will resolve itself in less than 60 days.


Passage number 397.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Less than 60 days.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only states a numerical value.


Passage number 398.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But I don't know that for sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing uncertainty or lack of knowledge about something.


Passage number 399.
MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, since we're on this subject, if Ican jump in here for a minute, one proviso I would make in my generalsupport of your proposal is that we breach a second tradition here, ifwe are going to drop the M1 target temporarily. Normally, is it not10/5/82true, Murray, that the minutes of this meeting would not be publiclyreleased until the December FOMC meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating Mr. Balles' opinion and suggestion regarding a proposal.


Passage number 400.
MR. ALTMANN. No, November 19th, three days after theNovember meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 401.
MR. BALLES. After the November meeting. I don't think wecan wait that long.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Balles, is expressing his opinion that waiting until November is not ideal.


Passage number 402.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but you haven't provided a passage for analysis. Could you please provide the passage you would like me to evaluate for contention or disagreement?


Passage number 403.
MR. BALLES. I think we need to get out this information PDQ.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states the opinion of Mr. Balles without any disagreement or contention being mentioned.


Passage number 404.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have to say something if we get a bigfigure in the first week of October. We have to say that so far as weknow that figure is an all savers phenomenon and we're not going topay any attention to it or to the M1 figures in the immediate future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is straightforward and does not present any conflicting viewpoints or contradictory ideas.


Passage number 405.
MR. BALLES. Okay, I agree completely. I'm glad to hear thatbecause to do otherwise I think would be very, very risky.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker explicitly states their agreement and expresses relief.


Passage number 406.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage as the provided text only includes the name "Governor Wallich." Additional context or information is required to make a judgement.


Passage number 407.
MR. WALLICH. Well, I feel very much that we would be betteroff if interest rates were lower. The question is: How do we getfrom here to there. The wisest thing, if we wanted to get there,would be that we shouldn't start from here. That option isn't open tous. We have to get there without sacrificing all that we've createdin the last year in terms of credibility and a framework for givingpeople confidence. So, I think we should still have a money supplydirective not, as this looks to me, a money market or interest ratedirective. I think we should give up temporarily on M1, which isbeset by all the uncertainties of the all savers certificates and thenew instrument. That doesn't mean we wouldn't go back to it.Logically, M1 is the best of the aggregates. We should stressliquidity preference more than the alternative directive does byputting a reference to it at the beginning of the last sentence,indicating that there is mounting evidence that exceptional liquiditydemands are upon us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion and suggested course of action.


Passage number 408.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. At the beginning of what sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 409.
MR. WALLICH. The last sentence. Instead of starting with"Somewhat more rapid," I would say "In the light of mounting evidencethat economic and financial uncertainties are continuing to lead toexceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in thebroader aggregates would be tolerated." So, we allow for an overshootof M2, which is the one thing I would suggest that we target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, disagrees with the suggestion to start the sentence with "Somewhat more rapid" and instead proposes a different wording and approach to addressing liquidity demands and targeting M2 growth.


Passage number 410.
MR. GRAMLEY. Do we have evidence of that, Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for evidence.


Passage number 411.
MR. WALLICH. Well, I think there is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 412.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It could be up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage is not specific enough in providing information or context to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 413.
MR. GRAMLEY. Liquidity preference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only states "MR. GRAMLEY. Liquidity preference" without providing any context or additional information to suggest any contention or disagreement. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is any contention or disagreement based on this statement alone.


Passage number 414.
10/5/82MR. WALLICH.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. It only mentions the name "Mr. Wallich" and a date "10/5/82", which does not present any clear indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 415.
 It seems clear that velocity, instead of risingas had been expected, is--MR. GRAMLEY. I thought the staff said that the increase inthe quantity of M1 recently is pretty much in line with a movementdown the demand function, given the current interest rates, and not ashift in the demand function.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their understanding of the staff's analysis and reiterating it.


Passage number 416.
MR. WALLICH.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage as it only mentions "Mr. Wallich" without any further context or information to indicate any form of disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 417.
 As you look at the behavior of velocity overthe year, it does not--MR. GRAMLEY. That was a good argument last April, but I'mnot sure it is now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The disagreement is indicated by Mr. Gramley's response, stating that the argument made last April may no longer be valid.


Passage number 418.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement evident in the given passage. The phrase "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" simply refers to a person's title or position, without providing any context or indication of disagreement.


Passage number 419.
 Well--MR. WALLICH. Well, I think it is a defensible argument. Iwould suggest that we drop the reference in the first sentence of thesecond paragraph to the expansion of bank reserves and reducedpressures but shape the M2 path in such a way that we would have agradual decline in interest rates. We would have to formulate theborrowing assumption to make that feasible. I can't do it off the topof my head; I don't know just what that would be. I would make thefunds range narrow to reflect the fact that we are backing away frommoney supply targets. And we could cap it at 10 percent, if that werereally necessary. All it would mean is that we would consult, and attimes like this we ought to consult more frequently anyway. That'show I would structure the directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply offering a suggestion on how to shape the M2 path and structure the directive. They mention that they cannot determine the borrowing assumption at the moment but provide their proposed changes to the funds range. Overall, there is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 420.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 421.
MR. BOEHNE. Well, I think how one comes out on this dependson whether one wants to take the risks on rules or on the side ofdiscretion. It does seem to me that we have pushed the domesticeconomy and the financial system and the world economy about as far aswe can push them. And this is not business as usual. I think we haveto take our chances on the side of discretion, which tells me that ata minimum we cannot have higher rates in these circumstances; and ifwe can get lower rates, that's fine. I must say, however, thatwhenever one bets on discretion versus rules, it depends a good bit onwho is making the discretionary decisions. I believe this kind ofdirective puts much more than the usual amount of authority in thehands of the Chairman. And with this particular Chairman, I don'thave any problems, given the circumstances. So, because of thesituation and because of the person who is going to have to use a goodbit of this discretion, I'm supportive of the general approach asproposed in the alternative directive language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 422.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles, I have you on the list, butyou have already commented. Or do you have something more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating that Mr. Balles has already commented, while Mr. Balles may have a different opinion or may want to add something additional.


Passage number 423.
MR. BALLES. I have one other question, Paul: Did you intendthat this be the entire part of the operational paragraph--that is tosay that we would have no mention of a federal funds rate range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 424.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have an open mind about that. I didn'tmean to infer one thing or the other; I don't know whether it's10/5/82necessary but I have no problem with it. I do think it has to be abit lower than we had before if we put it in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 425.
MR. BALLES. Right. When you are ready to discuss that, Ithink we ought to get that settled because if we create too manyrevolutions in one directive, we're surely going to shake up themarketplace.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing a concern and suggesting that the topic should be discussed and settled in order to avoid causing disruptions in the marketplace.


Passage number 426.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't have any problem with thetraditional sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that the person does not have any problem with the traditional sentence. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this statement.


Passage number 427.
MR. BALLES. I'm not sure what the better part of wisdom is;but if we stay silent on the federal funds range, that would really bea major break in tradition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and stating that remaining silent on the federal funds range would be a significant departure from tradition.


Passage number 428.
MR. BLACK. Then the issue is whether we're symmetricalaround [the current level].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black is simply stating that the issue being discussed is whether there is symmetry around the current level.


Passage number 429.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions "Mr. Keehn" without any further information or context.


Passage number 430.
MR. KEEHN. Given my sense of the general economic scenery, Icertainly am in the camp that thinks that we simply must bring ratesdown. I think we are at a point where we cannot go much longer in theway the economy is currently performing or we're going to see somevery serious results emerging. Therefore, I think it's exceptionallyimportant that we move toward bringing rates down. I certainly wouldunderstand and agree that there is a risk to this in that the markets,as we know, could see it adversely. But I would agree with GovernorMartin that mature and careful thinking is likely to [bring themarket] to the view that this seems to be a realistic change, giventhe circumstances we're dealing with. And I think the result could bepositive as opposed to being negative. So, I support the directive asit has been laid out. It seems to me that the last sentence is a veryimportant conclusion; [I'd leave it] rather than delete it. It is ourview that this is a major change that we're making but one that isappropriate and very important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Keen, expresses his belief and support for bringing rates down and acknowledges the potential risks but believes that careful thinking and considering the circumstances will lead to a positive outcome. There is no opposing viewpoint presented in the passage.


Passage number 431.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unfortunately, no. The given passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. It simply mentions Governor Rice without any additional context or details.


Passage number 432.
MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I have very little to add toyour tour d'horizon. I think it covers admirably the situation thatwe find ourselves in. I would simply want to emphasize one thing andthat is the timing of the recovery; the recovery is very late indeed.We've been expecting recovery for at least six months, possiblylonger. And the longer the economy stays in the doldrums, the greaterthe risk and the greater the dangers. In your words, the developingdisarray feeds upon itself, and until we see some evidence of aturnaround, I think we're in a very vulnerable situation. So, in thisenvironment, we should not do anything that risks rising interestrates; on the contrary, we should do what we reasonably can to getinterest rates moving down. Therefore, I support this directivelanguage. I also agree with those who would shift emphasis away fromM1 temporarily at this time. I also would retain the last twosentences of the directive; they give the sense that we have nottotally abandoned targeting of the aggregates and I think it'simportant to maintain that impression at this time. I don't know ifthis is the time to discuss borrowing, but if it is, I would beprepared to see borrowing in the range of $200 million or less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Rice, is expressing agreement with the points made in the previous discussion and is adding his own emphasis on the timing of the economic recovery. He supports the directive language and the shift in emphasis away from M1 temporarily. He also mentions his willingness to discuss borrowing in a specific range. Overall, the passage shows agreement and alignment of views.


Passage number 433.
10/5/82MS. TEETERS. That doesn't include those special liquidityneeds of particular banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the exclusion of special liquidity needs of specific banks.


Passage number 434.
MR. RICE. No, it doesn't.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rice is simply making a statement.


Passage number 435.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: This passage alone does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. The phrase "Governor Partee" does not indicate any specific context or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 436.
MR. PARTEE. I also would support a change in the directivelanguage this time. I'm perhaps a little less enthusiastic than someof you about specifying a desire for interest rates to move in aparticular way because I don't really think we know that much. Everyindication that we have does seem to suggest that interest rates aretoo high, but we just don't know that much about what determinesinterest rates and what they need to be to equilibrate markets. Iwould remind you all that we are in a situation with a deficit runningat $160 billion or thereabouts. And that really substitutes a cashflow financed by the government for a cash flow financed by theprivate sector. And since the government is interest-insensitive, onehas to presume that higher interest rates will be needed in theprivate sector than would otherwise occur. That's just one of many,many analytic comments made.But I am convinced that M1 for several months looking aheadis going to be a very poor and implausible indicator of what is goingon in terms of monetary expansion. As I've said, we did have a 38 or39 percent rate of increase in NOW accounts in July and August and wecertainly are going to have an all savers certificate bulge in NOWaccounts in the period right ahead. If I could think of some way tokeep the M1 range, I would; but it's so implausible that we would haveany idea what the number will be that I just don't know how to keep itand retain our credibility. It may well be that when the newinstrument comes out we will get a low M1, depending on how weclassify the new instrument, as M1 or M2. For the moment, though,we're just in total disarray and we need to recognize that fact. AndI would say that we need to recognize it publicly and soon becauseotherwise the market will react in the way Larry says. They will seea high number and will say that the Federal Reserve is going to haveto screw down on their number and therefore rates will go higher, andthey will work them higher in anticipation of that event. So, therehas to be some kind of communication, if we go ahead with this, soon.I'm not a great supporter of M2, as you all know, because Ithink it does have very important problems of interpretation in thelonger run. But for this immediate period ahead I'm not so disturbedabout an M2 number of the kind suggested, 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. Ireally can't imagine a liquidity change that is going to get us veryfar off that as an upper limit of what is likely to occur. The earlyindications are that [M2 in] October is going to be pretty low, so Ithink it's a fairly safe thing to go on. And mainly because we'recontemplating so many things that will make our critics suspicious--and I agree that they will be very suspicious--I would drop the lastsentence of the proposed directive. I understand that something couldhappen that would lead us off [track], but if we say here [that M2 is]expected to be in a range of around 8-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent for theSeptember-to-December period, with the expectation that October isgoing to be fairly low, I think it gives us enough room withoutraising this additional question in people's minds.10/5/82As I think about what is bothering a lot of you, inparticular this rate setting issue--and I think Bill Ford spoke outmost strongly on that--it may be this phrase at the beginning of thesecond paragraph, "taking account of the desirability of somewhatreduced pressures in private credit markets in the light of currenteconomic conditions." That would seem to me to be a signal that theFederal Reserve is following rates rather than a more objectivemeasure. So, I think it may be desirable to drop that phrase andsubstitute instead something like "consistent with the earlyresumption of economic growth," which doesn't necessarily imply lowerrates and easier conditions but does imply the need for an orderly andsustained flow of money and credit. That might help a little withthat problem. On the suggestion that Jerry Corrigan made that weagain repeat our insistence that we're going to be conservative over along period of time, I don't know. Jerry, there's a whole paragraphthat would be picked up from the past directive that talks about thelong-run plans of the Committee and so forth; to force it into thisparagraph seems to me so apologetic that it would backfire on us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and making suggestions for changes, but they do not argue against anyone else's opinion or ideas.


Passage number 437.
MR. CORRIGAN. I don't think anybody reads the boilerplate.The kind of thing I'm talking about, since I gather the Chairmanintends to say something, could be dealt with in that way as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Corrigan is expressing his opinion that nobody reads the boilerplate, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented in the passage.


Passage number 438.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think the way to handle it is thatit would be quite easy for the Chairman to say that we expect the rateof inflation to continue to decline next year and that over the longrun we will be following an anti-inflationary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents a suggested approach to handling a situation without any conflicting viewpoints or contrasting opinions.


Passage number 439.
 I wouldn't sayanything about the monetary aggregates next year but I'd say we expectthe rate of inflation to decline even with a--MR. PARTEE. It's difficult to handle here just in a phrasewithout sounding apologetic. The notion that we want to beconstraining and that we are going to continue to run monetary policypretty carefully is good, but the yardsticks have changed. We arehaving trouble measuring in this period using the conventionalyardsticks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It includes a statement about not saying anything about monetary aggregates next year, an expectation of a decline in the rate of inflation, and a comment about the difficulties in measuring and using yardsticks for monetary policy in the current period. However, there is no evident conflicting or contradictory information or opinions present.


Passage number 440.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The existing phrase I would remind yousays: "The Committee also indicated it was tentatively planning"--this is enshrined in our decision--"to continue the current ranges for1983 but it will review the decision carefully in the light ofdevelopments over the remainder of 1982." That's not exactly the mostringing [endorsement].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about a decision and stating that it is not the most enthusiastic endorsement.


Passage number 441.
MR. PARTEE. Not really, no.SPEAKER(.). I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers are in agreement with each other.


Passage number 442.
MR. PARTEE. On the other hand, I'm not sure I would beprepared to support much more than that for the year to come.One last comment. You spoke a little about the level ofborrowings. I don't see any reason to reduce the initial borrowingsso much from where they have been. If I understand it, what we havedone is to allow almost all of the expansion that occurred in themonetary aggregates to show through in larger nonborrowed reserves.So, borrowings really are where they are in good part because of theneed to deal with these special situation borrowings. We might reduce-46-10/5/82it to $400 to $500 million, but I wouldn't take it way down to thekinds of numbers that people have mentioned, $200 million or less, asa starting position. That's all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their uncertainty about supporting a larger amount for the year to come and their opinion on reducing initial borrowings.


Passage number 443.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 444.
MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, when I came to the meetingthis morning I was pretty much of the view that Bob Black and to someextent Bill Ford expressed. I must say that your review of the worldsituation prior to the coffee break woke me up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that the chairman's review of the world situation woke them up and potentially changed their initial viewpoint.


Passage number 445.
MR. BLACK. I demand equal time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black is simply making a request for equal time.


Passage number 446.
MR. BOYKIN. I agree in that I don't believe rates should goup. As far as the shift in emphasis on M2, that seems to me a fairlylogical extension of what we did with the NOW account situation. Itis a little bigger and maybe not quite as subtle, but I don't think itwould be that hard to explain, really, what we are doing. There issome precedent for that aspect of it. In terms of understandabilityof what we are likely to be doing, [I was comforted by] the commentyou made that you would have an opportunity in the not too distantfuture [to explain this]. That would be extremely important in termsof how this is actually perceived, certainly in the short run, beforepeople have an opportunity to analyze the record in some detail. So,I would come out with those who certainly don't want rates to go upand who want even some decline. As far as the wording of thedirective, I don't think I could make very much of a contribution tothat. There are a number of subtleties being expressed and I'm notsure I appreciate all of them. I couldn't improve on any of them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear points of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 447.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage.


Passage number 448.
MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have just a coupleof observations. One is that, clearly, all the discussion around thetable has been [consistent with] a money market conditions or interestrate directive. Secondly, I agree with the comments that Ed Boehneexpressed with respect to the discretion that is vested in theChairman in the intermeeting period with this kind of a directive. Asa result, I'd like to ask the Chairman if he's prepared to make somestatement as to the appropriate interest rate level and the pattern ofgetting there. Clearly, it is in the down [direction]. But in orderto understand how the Chairman may exercise that discretion, it wouldhelp me to understand what you're thinking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of observations and agreement among the speakers.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 449.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will respond to that shortly, after Mr.Roos and Mr. Morris get finished with their comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The mention of Mr. Roos and Mr. Morris getting finished with their comments suggests that there may be differing opinions or perspectives being expressed in their remarks.


Passage number 450.
MR. ROOS. In that order.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It is simply presenting someone's statement or response to a question.


Passage number 451.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Either order; I have Mr. Roos first on mylist.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple statement about having Mr. Roos first on the speaker's list, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 452.
MR. ROOS. All right, I'd be pleased to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. The speaker appears willing and eager to fulfill the other person's request.


Passage number 453.
MR. CORRIGAN. There's a certain appropriateness to these twoguys being last.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 454.
-47-10/5/82MR. ROOS. Let me say, Mr. Chairman, that I was bothimpressed and depressed with your review of the world situation, and Idon't minimize that in any way. Let me also say that no one at thistable would prefer lower interest rates more than I. I do takeexception to any implication that recent Federal Reserve policy haswrung out the economy of this country or has been detrimental to theinternational economy. I think what has occurred is more a result often or fifteen years of irresponsible monetary policies throughout theworld--as well as a well-meant effort on the part of the Federal OpenMarket Committee as long as I've been on it and until October 1979--totry to do just what we're doing today, and that is to lean againstinterest rate movements. I think that contributed in a major way toinflation, which really led to this high interest rate pattern that wehave. I believe that what we're about to do today will unquestionablybe viewed by those who watch what we do as a major change. I don'tthink it will be possible to explain away the fact that, albeittemporarily, we are moving away from [targeting] a narrow aggregatethat has predicted prices and output better than other variables. Itwill be apparent, in spite of any disclaimers we may or may not make,that we are moving toward placing greater emphasis on controlling thefed funds rate. And I think it will be misconstrued by the markets.It will be associated with the forthcoming election; I think it willgive comfort to those who, rightly or wrongly, have sat on thesidelines and implied that somewhere along the line we would cave inon our present policy posture.Mr. Chairman, there's no question that under your leadershipwe have made enormous strides toward wringing out the inflationaryproblem and restoring the economy to at least a semblance ofstability. I think our credibility and your credibility areunbelievably and deservably affirmed at present. If we fail tospecify in this directive at least some M1 range, with all thedisclaimers that these things that are going to happen could distortit and cause us to change, I think there will be a grossmisinterpretation and misconception of what we are doing. And itcould conceivably destroy much of the progress that we've made. So,although I don't have a vote, I feel it's a gross mistake to do whatapparently we're about to do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support and agreement with the chairman's review of the world situation and the Federal Reserve's policies. They also express concern about potential misconceptions and the need to specify the M1 range in the directive.


Passage number 455.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only states the name "Mr. Morris" without any additional information.


Passage number 456.
MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, it just so happens that we haveopposite extremes finishing up this discussion. I look upon it as agreat step forward that we have gotten M1 out of the directive. And Idon't view it as a temporary phenomenon because I think our ability tointerpret M1 is going to continue to be highly questionable for sometime to come. This is not a two- or three-month phenomenon as far asI can see. But that remains to be seen. Nonetheless, I support themove at this point in time and I would hope that borrowing is set at alevel that would get the funds rate down to the 9 to 9-1/2 percentarea as a start.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their support for a certain move without expressing disagreement or opposition towards anyone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 457.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have a late starter, Mr. Solomon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 458.
MR. PARTEE. He hasn't said a word.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage because the speaker is describing a person who has remained silent.


Passage number 459.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think this is a rather momentousFOMC meeting. I had thought that we had until maybe 1986 before the-48-10/5/82pace of deregulation and innovation would bring us to this point. Butthe Garn Bill and legislation that was [unintelligible] today--what'sthe name of that act.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement expressing the speaker's personal opinion about the significance of a specific FOMC meeting and their surprise at the pace of deregulation and innovation.


Passage number 460.
MR. RICE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I cannot determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without the actual passage. Could you please provide the text?


Passage number 461.
 The Garn-St Germain--MR. PARTEE. I can think of several names.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is incomplete, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement present without further context.


Passage number 462.
MR. WALLICH. Depository surprise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Depository surprise" by Mr. Wallich is ambiguous and does not convey any clear stance or disagreement.


Passage number 463.
MR. MORRIS. The destruction of M1 bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The word "destruction" suggests a negative or destructive action, but there is no mention of disagreement or contention in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 464.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It has moved us very quickly most ofthe way to the deregulation that we expected by 1986. I think we havea real dilemma here today. On substance, I feel that we absolutelyhave to have some modest decline in rates. I believe there is a realdanger of a major cracking and then we would have to go even farther;whereas with a modest decline now that stays in place for a whilethere is a better chance of working ourselves out of this bothinternationally and at home. I recognize that there will be a gooddeal of questioning, not only in monetarist circles but moregenerally. I don't think there will be an avalanche of criticism,given our credibility, but there will be major questioning as to whatthis means in terms of longer-run anti-inflationary policy. And itseems to me that there ought to be some words [to convey] our longer-run commitment and our expectations that inflation will continue tocome down--and possibly they should be just in the Chairman'sstatements and other statements, not in the directive. I don't knowhow to do it in the directive without sounding defensive, but thereought to be some words about that.So, I would support this. I do feel that if one reads thiscarefully, we are really not targeting M2. We are targeting basicallymoney market conditions and we are saying that we expect this willinvolve growth of M2 in the range of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent.Therefore, I'm not sure that we really need the last sentence. Thelast sentence simply makes more explicit what is there quite carefully[unintelligible]. I don't see that the way this is written, with theexpectation of M2 growth of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, is a constraint ondoing what is necessary to get the operative sentence. And if I amcorrect in my interpretation, I don't see why we need that lastsentence. In that sense, I would agree with Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the inclusion of the last sentence, stating that it is unnecessary and redundant. They argue that the expectation of M2 growth already allows for flexibility in achieving the desired outcome, so the last sentence is not needed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 465.
MR. PARTEE. But I also would drop the operative sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The use of "But" suggests a contradictory viewpoint or disagreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 466.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I wouldn't drop the operativesentence because then people don't know where we are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not express contention or disagreement. It is a suggestion to maintain clarity in communication.


Passage number 467.
MR. PARTEE. We're targeting on 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 468.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The presentation is critical. Andjudging from past history, the presentation is probably going to bemore dependent on the Chairman's statements than it will be on thedirective, particularly given the [publication] lag and the fact thatwe are expecting such a large bulge in the first week of October andsomething has to be said. Now, since the Chairman has a mind of hisown, I would assume that if he gets a majority vote on the substanceof this directive that it may not be worth spending a lot of time10/5/82interpreting and arguing about the more marginal sentences. We aremaking a major substantive decision here. And the presentation ofthat in a way that does not undermine our credibility is absolutelyessential. But we do have a lot going for us in terms of credibilityon the longer-run anti-inflationary policy.Turning to the specifics, even with an initial borrowingassumption of $200 million, I don't think the funds rate would getdown even to 9 percent unless this action is followed by a discountrate cut. And I urge that, in the Board's infinite wisdom, that beconfined to 1/2 point rather than a point. It is my reading--and Icould be wrong--that if the discount rate is cut 1/2 point, themarkets will expect another half point later on, almost immediately.If we do a full point, many people in the market may say that afterthe election there will be another full point. This election thingis a damn shame because we are not being influenced by the election.But the timing is very awkward for us. Anyway, that's another area.I would recommend that the initial borrowing be $200 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their opinion and making recommendations based on their own analysis.


Passage number 469.
MR. GUFFEY. In terms of the pattern that you might expect tooccur: If I understood your most recent statement, you suggestedinterest rates would be at or near their present levels for someperiod of time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing another person's statement without expressing any disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 470.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we would tend to have an easierfunds rate than we had just recently if [the Board] did nothing on thediscount rate. If the discount rate were reduced, I think rates wouldgo down. Again, we have a setting here where these numbers, even whenwe have them on a preliminary basis, are about as reliable as I don'tknow what. But over the course of the period that we're talking abouthere--in the next couple of weeks up until the Friday when the figureis published that will include a presumed distortion from all saverscertificates--we may have an M1 figure that is on target in the latestweekly figure. We probably will have an unemployment rate that is upsignificantly and an industrial production figure shortly--I don't10/5/82know when that comes out--that is down and, hopefully, a good pricefigure in there someplace, too. I don't know what other criticalnumbers are coming out in the next ten days.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It primarily discusses potential economic factors and data without presenting conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 471.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, what does the unemployment ratelook like now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black is simply asking a question to gather information.


Passage number 472.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know. I don't have anyparticular guess. We can turn to the staff. We know that theunemployment claims figures have shot up enormously. I think thegeneral assumption is that it's going to be 10 percent plus, and I'mnot sure that anybody can be much more specific than that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is uncertain about the specific unemployment rate but acknowledges the general assumption that it will be 10 percent or higher.


Passage number 473.
MR. FORD. Mr. Chairman, you did say you were planning tomake some kind of public statement about this rather than just waitinga month [or so] until after the next meeting. When, roughly, were youplanning to say something about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple clarification question.


Passage number 474.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I have a tentative date with theBusiness Council at the end of this week where I have to appear at alittle press conference after I talk at any event. So, that's theeasiest occasion just because it's already scheduled and comes in thenormal course of events and we don't have to make any big deal aboutit.What I might suggest, since it's 1:20 p.m., is that people goout and get some sandwiches. There may be some desire to discuss thisfurther in substance. And if there is going to be some effort to foolaround with the language or drop sentences or whatever, it gives usfifteen minutes or so to think about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing their upcoming schedule and suggesting that everyone grab some sandwiches to eat while they continue their discussion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 475.
[Lunch recess]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This need not be taken as strikingly assome people either fear or hope, depending upon which side of thespectrum they are on. I don't consider anything in here veryinconsistent with what we've been doing. We have said we are going tointerpret the aggregates somewhat loosely in effect--I'm nowinterpolating--in the light of our judgment as to whether there areunusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity. The market hasassumed we are operating that way quite comfortably and this is anextension of that idea. What it does is to take out M1 for a veryparticular reason. I raise the question because there is this talkabout how to say it publicly. If we write a letter to the Congress,for instance, and say we've changed the targets or we have some newoperating approach or some such thing, I think that makes it much moregrandiose than is intended in my mind. I am reluctant to have aspecially called press conference or a speech or something for thesame reason. It just makes it sound as if we're off on some entirelynew course. I think we have to get the message over publicly that,indeed, we're not going to be worried about the M1 figure in the shortrun, if we're not. We have in effect said--and we are repeating andamplifying what we said--that we would tolerate for some period oftime growth somewhat above the target range should unusualprecautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident. Going backto my testimony [in July], I know I had a lot of criteria--theperformance of the economy, interest rates I deliberately put in, theavailability of bank credit--all of which I said bear upon that-53-10/5/82judgment. That's what I said in the testimony. We think, yes, allthose things are operative now and we are willing to tolerate a bulgein the targeted growth if that is necessary in this time period. Itis precisely the circumstances that we foresaw as a possibility. Idon't think it's that big a deal. Other people put otherinterpretations on it. I just tell you that I don't think it has tobe read as too big a deal. In any event, assuming that we are in thisgeneral neighborhood, let us pin down the operations morespecifically, which comes down pretty much to the initial borrowinglevel, I think. We've had proposals from $200 [to $300] million andnow we have proposals above $300 million, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that there are different interpretations and opinions about the topic being discussed.


Passage number 476.
MR. PARTEE. $400 million, I thought. What has it beenrunning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The response is a simple statement of fact.


Passage number 477.
MR. STERNLIGHT. $500 million is what we've been using in thepath; it is actually $560 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 478.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think it's going to be $500 to 600million. What was it yesterday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker disagrees with the statement that the cost will be $500 to $600 million and questions what the cost was yesterday.


Passage number 479.
MR. STERNLIGHT. $300 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of fact about the amount of money, $300 million.


Passage number 480.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I may not be up-to-date on it. We havemore reserves in there than we should and deliberately haven't takenthem out, given the market conditions so far this week. We just leavethem, I guess; I don't know what borrowings will be. They can't bemuch below that, but the excess reserves may be very high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their lack of knowledge about a certain topic (borrowings) and expressing uncertainty about the level of excess reserves.


Passage number 481.
MR. AXILROD. We allowed for about $500 million and so farthey are a little over $1 billion; that could come out on its own ifour projections are wrong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the projected cost being higher than initially anticipated. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict between parties.


Passage number 482.
MR. PARTEE. But in drawing the path you allowed for about$500 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The statement is made by Mr. Partee without any contradicting statements or opposing opinions.


Passage number 483.
MR. AXILROD. We allowed for $500 million because the weekwith the quarter-end statement date normally has well above normalexcess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about allowing for $500 million in excess reserves during a specific time period.


Passage number 484.
MR. PARTEE. And that was after having made the adjustment toprovide the nonborrowed reserves consistent with the observedovershoot in M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 485.
MR. AXILROD. That's right, and then to allow for the[unintelligible] week statement date excess reserve averaging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 486.
MS. TEETERS. Did the $500 million have any specialborrowings built into it, Steve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question is seeking information about whether the $500 million had any special borrowings built into it.


Passage number 487.
MR. AXILROD. There is some. The Midland Bank in Dallasstill is in for some; I've forgotten the exact number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that there is some issue or problem with Midland Bank in Dallas, but the exact number or details are not remembered.


Passage number 488.
MR. BOYKIN. That's down to about $75 million now.month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a decrease in a specific amount of money.


Passage number 489.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine the answer without the actual passage.


Passage number 490.
 Yes, they haven't been in for a while--about a10/5/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think there is any mechanicalrelationship with these special borrowings. I must say that isdifficult to handle; the bank in the weakest position gets hit and themarkets are a little tight. If that bank didn't borrow, others wouldhave to borrow, in part.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is discussing a situation without presenting conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 491.
MR. GRAMLEY. When the staff made out the alternatives in theBluebook, the difference in borrowing levels between "A" and "B" wasrather substantial, $150 million versus $450 million. The $450million was associated with essentially no change in market interestrates and "A" was associated with some easing, but I didn't get theimpression that it was that significant an amount of easing. If wewere to go, say, to a number like $400 million, it would imply hardlyany change in market interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 492.
MR. AXILROD. At the present level of the discount rate, Ithink that's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing agreement with a previous statement or opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 493.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think $400 million is too highmyself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker believes that $400 million is too high, implying that they think the amount is excessive or unreasonable.


Passage number 494.
MR. CORRIGAN. In terms of the range of proposals around thetable, I can easily live with borrowings of $300 or maybe $350million; I would have a small preference for putting a 7 to 10 percentfederal funds range in the directive for no other reason than a desireto reinforce continuity at the margin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Corrigan is expressing his personal preference for a specific range of borrowing and a desire for continuity, but there is no clear opposition or conflict mentioned.


Passage number 495.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me get to the directive later.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence simply expresses the speaker's intention to address the directive at a later time.


Passage number 496.
MR. PARTEE. 7 to 10 percent is worse than nothing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement is expressing a negative opinion about the 7 to 10 percent, but it does not present any contention or disagreement with another party or viewpoint.


Passage number 497.
MS. TEETERS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 498.
 I would prefer a lower--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, how many like $200 million. Howmany like $300 million. How many like higher than $300 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for preferences regarding different monetary amounts, without expressing any disagreement or contention towards the options.


Passage number 499.
MR. PARTEE. Well, obviously, take $300 million with--SPEAKER(.). From among the others.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no evidence of contention or disagreement in this passage. The response from the speaker is cut off, so no opposing perspective or disagreement is expressed.


Passage number 500.
MR. PARTEE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Yes, there is contention or disagreement indicated by the use of the word "Yes" in response to a statement made by someone else. However, without the context of the rest of the passage, it is difficult to determine the exact nature or topic of the disagreement.


Passage number 501.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions Chairman Volcker without providing any context or information that suggests contention or disagreement.


Passage number 502.
 I have determined that $300 million is thearithmetic average of--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If he took a weighted average, itwould be $293 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states two different average values.


Passage number 503.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Assuming somebody is going to vote for thedirective, let's take that poll again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is making a hypothetical statement and suggesting to conduct the poll again in that case. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 504.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, it really should only be the people who aregoing to vote yes [on the directive] who are allowed to vote [onthis]. We've run into that problem with contemporaneous reserveaccounting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It only mentions a problem that has been encountered with contemporaneous reserve accounting.


Passage number 505.
MR. RICE. We certainly have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only includes a statement without any signs of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 506.
10/5/82MS. TEETERS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage appears to be a date followed by a person's name, "TEETERS." It does not provide any information or context that would indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 507.
 That ought to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are there other operational questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrases "That ought to" and "Are there other operational questions" suggest that two different ideas or perspectives are being presented, possibly with conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 508.
MR. BLACK. Would we take Midland Bank out of that $300million, Steve, or would we leave it in there as we did on the $500million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification about whether or not the Midland Bank should be included in the specified amount of money.


Passage number 509.
MR. BOYKIN. They ought to be out by the end of the week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a statement made by Mr. Boykin about when something should happen.


Passage number 510.
MR. BLACK. Well, that will solve the issue then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The statement "Well, that will solve the issue then" suggests a resolution or agreement.


Passage number 511.
MR. STERNLIGHT. But on occasion we'll get another borrower,either them or somebody else, and that will raise the question ofwhether borrowing is going to [include or exclude that bank].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 512.
MR. BLACK. Well, as nearly as possible it ought to be thereif it's interest-sensitive, it seems to me, if it's to give us anyguidance on federal funds rates. That's all I was hoping we would do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black is expressing his opinion and stating what he believes should happen, but there is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 513.
MR. PARTEE. When you say other operational questions, areyou talking about the question of the federal funds range specified.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a clarifying question.


Passage number 514.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, let's get to that as part of thedirective.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting focusing on something specific in the future, implying cooperation and agreement.


Passage number 515.
MR. PARTEE. Oh, I see. But other operating considerations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply an observation or clarification.


Passage number 516.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. In effect, we're in an area ofjudgment depending upon that happens to the aggregates and the economyand interest rates and so forth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that judgments are subjective and depend on various factors such as aggregates, the economy, and interest rates.


Passage number 517.
MR. BALLES. I have an operational question, Paul. For thoseof us who are skeptical that M2 is going to grow as fast as 8-1/2 or9-1/2 percent, given the way that the money market funds are slowingdown and so on: How is the Desk going to operate under the directiveas it stands here. Are they going to be targeting on 8-1/2 to 9-1/2percent M2 growth. I just want to make sure it's a workable directivefrom the standpoint of Desk implementation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for clarification and confirmation on how the Desk will operate under the directive.


Passage number 518.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's an interesting question if infact [the M2 figures] run low for a month. There are twopossibilities, I suppose. Let's assume they are running low but theevidence that we have currently is that it is a temporary phenomenonand [the rate of growth] doesn't look unreasonable for the quarter.It is stated as a [rate for the] quarter. Then, I would think weprobably would not do too much. If they are running low and wethought they were actually running below these figures, theimplication is that interest rates will come down. We would ease theposition; that's what it says.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing different possibilities and their implications, but there is no argument or disagreement between multiple parties.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 519.
MR. GUFFEY. Which drops interest rates and worsens that verysituation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The phrase "which drops interest rates and worsens that very situation" suggests that there is contention or disagreement. This statement implies that the action being referred to (which is not mentioned in the given passage) is believed to have negative consequences, therefore implying disagreement or contention.


Passage number 520.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you mean by "worsens"--that wewould get really slower growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a question asking for clarification on the meaning of "worsens" and expressing uncertainty about the potential outcome of slower growth.


Passage number 521.
MR. BALLES. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement between Mr. Balles and others.


Passage number 522.
-56-10/5/82MR. GUFFEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage consists of a string of characters that does not convey any information or context to determine if there is disagreement or contention.


Passage number 523.
 Sure, when interest rates--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states that when interest rates change, Chairman Volcker will take action.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 524.
 Well, I don't think the staff thinks so,but I would raise a very interesting question as to whether we haven'tbeen too tight because higher interest rates bloomed--MR. PARTEE. That next to last sentence I think has somemeaning.SPEAKER(.). Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests a disagreement between the speaker and the staff. The speaker believes that they may have been too tight and questions whether higher interest rates have caused problems.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 525.
MR. GRAMLEY. It not only says would be "acceptable" butwould be "desirable" in the context of declining interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The phrase "would be 'desirable'" suggests that there is some level of disagreement or contention. While the passage does not explicitly state who finds it desirable, the use of the word implies that there may be different perspectives on the matter.


Passage number 526.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions "MR. PARTEE" without providing any further context or information.


Passage number 527.

We have a big10/5/82decrease this week; suppose we get a relatively modest--say, anoffsetting--increase the following week and then it falls down againthe week after that.

My point, Tony, is that the phrase "in the lightof current economic conditions" as it stands there is a very neutralone and, in my mind, too weak. I would like to see something like "inlight of the currently weak economy" or whatever, unless that is goingto be made clear somewhere else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Balles believes that the phrase "in the light of current economic conditions" is too weak and suggests a stronger alternative.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the meaning of a phrase and expressing awareness and concern about certain pressures in privatemarkets.

Passage number 594.
 But you are saying credit conditions areaffected by--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think one can interpret it eitherway. The reason we're concerned about this is because of the economy.But it also works in reverse. The economy, and the internationaleconomy in particular, is giving rise to the pressures. But we'reconcerned about the pressures because of economic conditions. So, Ithink it works both ways.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges two different perspectives and suggests that both interpretations are valid.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

There is contention or disagreement in the passage because the speaker mentions that the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets should be taken into account, indicating that they believe reducing pressures in these markets would be beneficial.

Passage number 598.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

If we want to blur it a bit, we could say "takingaccount of the evidence of pressures in private credit markets in thelight of current economic conditions. It combines the sentences.

It is a statement made by Mr. Ford, speculating about the possibility that some people may not like the new instruments invented by the DIDC (presumably the Detroit Instrument and Die Casting Company).


Passage number 615.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They could.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The given passage is incomplete, making it difficult to determine if there is any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 616.
MR. PARTEE. That's right.SPEAKER(.). That's a possibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement evident in this passage. Both people are simply stating the same thing and agreeing with each other.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 617.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, there could be some transfer out ofTreasury bills or other highly liquid instruments, particularly ifthey pay a higher rate than Treasury bills.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there could be contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement suggests that there may be a potential transfer of funds from Treasury bills or other highly liquid instruments to investments that offer a higher interest rate. This could lead to differing opinions or debate among individuals or investors on whether it is advisable to make such a transfer. Some may argue in favor of pursuing higher returns, while others may prioritize the safety and stability of Treasury bills.


Passage number 618.
MR. PARTEE. We could have a sudden drop in consumptionrelative to income.SPEAKER(.). That's possible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement between Mr. Partee and the speaker. The speaker is simply acknowledging the possibility stated by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 619.
MR. PARTEE. It would seem about as low as it can be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 620.
MR. BLACK. Demand is a lot lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply stating a fact, that demand is lower.


Passage number 621.
MR. PARTEE. Relatively, yes. [Unintelligible] withoutdestroying income [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage as it is unintelligible and lacks sufficient information to determine any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 622.
10/5/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, one way to do it is just to say "inall the uncertainty" and leave the other wording as it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The suggestion given to say "in all the uncertainty" does not contradict or challenge any of the other wording in the passage.


Passage number 623.
MR. GRAMLEY. Save that "maintain the expansion of bankreserves" and leave the rest of the phrase as it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement appears to be a straightforward suggestion without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 624.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Just leave the first phrase as it isthrough money and credit comma, then "consistent with growth of M2 andM3 in a range of around 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate fromSeptember to December and taking account of the desirability ofsomewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets in the light ofcurrent economic conditions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 625.
"MR. GRAMLEY. Then we need to change something else in thesentence; maybe we don't. The reference to those aggregates is prettyfar back. To then say "Somewhat slower growth...
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Gramley is suggesting that something may need to be changed in the sentence, but there is no disagreement or conflict present.


Passage number 626.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're in the next sentence. Well,tentatively that first sentence is all right. Then there are allsorts of suggestions about these last two sentences and whether toleave them in or take them out. I don't think it's too critical oneway or the other if we understand the thrust of what it's all about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply discusses the possibility of leaving or removing the last two sentences without emphasizing any conflicting opinions or viewpoints.


Passage number 627.
MR. WALLICH. I would prefer to leave them in. They balanceeach other and they justify an overrun or an underrun.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 628.
MR. RICE. I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the given passage, Mr. Rice expresses agreement with a statement. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 629.
MR. BALLES. I do too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreement.


Passage number 630.
MS. TEETERS. I agree with Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 631.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You had a suggested rewording in that lastsentence which I didn't think changed it much substantively but madeit read better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is merely acknowledging that there was a suggested rewording and sharing their thoughts on it.


Passage number 632.
MS. TEETERS. Just switch one of the clauses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 633.
MR. WALLICH. I would have put the second part of the lastsentence first so that the sentence would read, beginning with themiddle of the second line, "In the light of evidence that economic andfinancial uncertainties are continuing to lead to exceptionalliquidity demands.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of opinion or suggestion by Mr. Wallich regarding the order of the sentence.


Passage number 634.
"MR. PARTEE. If there should be evidence of something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any evidence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 635.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, that's what I was looking for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 636.
MR. WALLICH.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The provided passage does not provide sufficient information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 637.
 Well, I meant to say that there is evidence andthat is--MR. GRAMLEY. That, I think, is questionable, Henry; I reallydo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley states that the evidence is questionable, contradicting what was initially said about there being evidence.


Passage number 638.
MR. PARTEE. Well, if there is, we should have taken thatinto account in setting our M2 target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing the potential need to consider any disagreement or contention when setting the M2 target.


Passage number 639.
-63-10/5/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. I think it's all right the way itis, if I understand this correctly. "In the light of evidence thateconomic and financial uncertainties are continuing..." We leave thatopen as to whether it is continuing. That does say they have happenedin the past, which I have said.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the statement and provides an explanation for their agreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 640.
MR. GRAMLEY. M2 is again very, very low. [Relative to] thetargeted M2 now, the last number we have is very low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates disagreement or contention as the speaker states that M2 is "very, very low" relative to the targeted M2, implying that it is not at an acceptable level.


Passage number 641.
 And it's justawfully hard to see why--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The last month's number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain anything that suggests contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement.


Passage number 642.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 643.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But not the previous two months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage because it is simply stating a fact about the previous two months.


Passage number 644.
MR. GRAMLEY. I know, but the previous two months presumablywere affected by the fact that interest rates came down. We have toask ourselves whether we're talking about a movement along the demandfunction or a shift in the demand function. And as far as I know, therecent evidence does not strongly point toward an upward shift indemand for money. And that's the way I interpret the staff's commentsin the briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting a viewpoint and interpretation of the evidence.


Passage number 645.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not sure that's right. Theirvelocity is rising.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "Well, I'm not sure that's right" suggests that there may be disagreement or doubt, but the second part of the sentence "Their velocity is rising" is a statement rather than a counterargument.


Passage number 646.
MS. TEETERS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 647.
 Well, the NOW accounts are--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Falling, I'm sorry. Changing, anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker interrupts themselves and acknowledges that they made a mistake, apologizing for it.


Passage number 648.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, velocity of M2 does have some cyclicalmovements to it. We sort of expect that when interest rates fall,velocity is going to go down some; now, whether it's off the function,I don't know. But I thought the staff said yesterday that theevidence of recent money behavior is consistent with movement alongthe function and not a shift.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley acknowledges that the velocity of M2 has some cyclical movements and expresses uncertainty about whether it is off the function. He then mentions that the staff said yesterday that the evidence of recent money behavior is consistent with movement along the function and not a shift. There is no conflicting or contradictory information presented.


Passage number 649.
MR. AXILROD. Well, I wasn't there but if they said anything,the M1 behavior might suggest that. I don't think we can say verymuch about M2. On M1, if you look at the models--depending upon whichquarter you start with--you can interpret M1 as being roughly on thequarterly money demand model. If you start in the first quarter, itmight be an upward shift instead of a downward shift; if you start inthe third quarter, it's about on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing their perspective and interpretation of the data.


Passage number 650.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not so sure this is any bigdeal, I'm not quite sure what you had, Henry, but let's change it."In the light of evidence that economic and financial uncertaintiesare leading to..." That puts it in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing uncertainty and a suggestion to change something in the future.


Passage number 651.
MR. WALLICH. I don't want to press this very hard. There isa parallelism between the two sentences. The first says "somewhatslower growth" and the other says "somewhat more rapid growth." Andthat makes it look more understandable. I would like to see somethingabout rising liquidity demands. Granted, there are some questionsabout that. But that seems to me to give us a better argument forbeing flexible about the targets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich is expressing his opinion and suggesting that considering rising liquidity demands would provide a better argument for being flexible about the targets.


Passage number 652.
-64-10/5/82VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Even though both sentences have aparallelism, the bottom line of both sentences is lower interestrates. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show contention or disagreement. It simply states that both sentences have parallelism and convey the idea of lower interest rates.


Passage number 653.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not the second one. It doesn't say lower;it just says they wouldn't be as high as they otherwise would be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply providing a clarification or correction about the information presented in the second part, without expressing any disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 654.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, okay. But [conditions are]easier in terms of interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges the previous point and agrees with it.


Passage number 655.
MS. TEETERS. Why.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 656.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no clear statement or argument provided in the passage for there to be contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 657.
 That's the thrust of both sentences,given the fact that we are making--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, no. I think that's unclear yet,[though they are] easier than they otherwise would be. The firstsentence says interest rates would be going down and the secondsentence presumably says they wouldn't be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The first sentence suggests that interest rates would be going down, while the second sentence implies that they would not be going down as much as they could. This discrepancy creates disagreement or contradiction within the passage.


Passage number 658.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The second sentence says we wouldtolerate more rapid growth, which means we would have lower interestrates than we would otherwise have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The second sentence is simply stating a hypothetical scenario that if there were more rapid growth, it would lead to lower interest rates.


Passage number 659.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage only mentions Chairman Volcker without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 660.
 Than we would otherwise have, but higherthan--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Okay. The thrust of both sentencesis for easier conditions in the markets, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a hypothetical scenario and confirming the intended result.


Passage number 661.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, the thrust of the second sentence isnot for easier conditions in the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The second sentence merely states that there is a desire for easier conditions in the market, without presenting any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 662.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 663.
 Well, you are interpreting--MR. PARTEE. We won't let it tighten the [market] up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker will not allow the interpretation to have a restrictive effect on the market.


Passage number 664.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm talking relatively.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "I'm talking relatively" suggests that the speaker is providing a comparative or relative perspective on something, but it does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 665.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, there is nothing in the secondsentence that says the more rapid the growth the lower the interestrate will be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the sentence. It simply states a relationship between the rapidity of growth and the interest rate without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or contradictory statements.


Passage number 666.
MS. TEETERS. Why don't you just take out the words "arecontinuing to".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by MS. TEETERS suggesting the removal of the words "are continuing to" for unspecified reasons.


Passage number 667.
MR. BALLES. And put in instead "are leading to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement by Mr. Balles without any opposing opinions or conflicting information.


Passage number 668.
"MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 669.
 CORRIGAN and MS. TEETERS. Yes, say "lead to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Yes, say 'lead to'" indicates that CORRIGAN and MS. TEETERS have differing opinions or perspectives on the topic being discussed.


Passage number 670.
"MR. PARTEE. Well, I really think "in the light of" also isvery ambiguous. It ought to be "if, in the presence of evidence" orthat kind of thing. We used "in the light of" up above in a way thatI didn't quite understand and we're using it again here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MR. PARTEE is expressing his opinion and suggesting an alternative phrase to clarify the ambiguity, but there is no opposing viewpoint or argument present.


Passage number 671.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the name "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" without providing any information or context that can be used to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 672.
 It [needs] something a little less awkwardbut "in the presence of" sounds like the presence of a---65-10/5/82MS. TEETERS. Take out that whole thing "in light of theevidence that" and just put "if." That would work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting a change to make the sentence less awkward and more concise.


Passage number 673.
MR. PARTEE. Or "should economic and financial uncertaintieslead to exceptional liquidity demands.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 674.
"MR. AXILROD. There's the language of the last directive--"are leading to...
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod is simply stating that there is language in the last directive.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 675.
"MR. PARTEE. I guess nobody else shares my preference thatthis sentence be dropped. None of those who plan to vote for thedirective shares my preference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Party, expresses his preference to drop a sentence, and states that none of those who plan to vote for the directive share his preference.


Passage number 676.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe everybody is going to vote for it."Should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptionalliquidity demands, somewhat more rapid..." Is that what we're saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no explicit contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement or question without any conflicting ideas or viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 677.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, I think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident from the word "Yes" at the beginning of the speaker's response, indicating a disagreement with an opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 678.
MS. TEETERS. I don't think it really matters whether it'ssomewhat more rapid.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 679.
MR. PARTEE. And that, of course, has to be interpreted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement made by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 680.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Actually, that previous sentence almostgoes without saying and I don't know whether that's necessary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the necessity of stating the previous sentence but does not indicate any disagreement or contention with it.


Passage number 681.
MS. TEETERS. Well, it gives us a little [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. TEETERS seems to be expressing a thought or opinion but it is not clear due to the unintelligible part.


Passage number 682.
It puzzles--MR. PARTEE. Well, I think it says that if we could do itwithout a lot of effort, we'd prefer to meet our targets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that if meeting the targets requires minimal effort, they would prefer that option.


Passage number 683.
MR. CORRIGAN. I think that second to the last sentence isvery helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement simply states that the second to the last sentence is helpful, without any signs of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 684.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think we have to leave in somethingmore or less like the last two sentences since we have now said"consistent with M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing the speaker's opinion on the inclusion of certain sentences, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement with others.


Passage number 685.
"MR. PARTEE. Yes, we have a target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 686.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Earlier, I didn't think it wasnecessary to leave in those sentences.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a personal opinion or belief without presenting any opposing viewpoints or creating an argument.


Passage number 687.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. What about the federal funds ratesentence. In or out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply asks about the inclusion or exclusion of the federal funds rate.


Passage number 688.
MR. PARTEE. I'd prefer not to have it. It's enough of achange that it's difficult to know what the funds range should be.Our tradition on the funds range has been to make it above and belowthe present rate; apparently that's not acceptable. And the rangethat was suggested was a 3-point spread; we dropped it from 5 pointsto 4 points last time and to go on to 3 points seems to me woulddestroy more than it would accomplish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only expresses the personal preference and opinion of Mr. Partee. There is no indication of contention or disagreement between multiple parties.


Passage number 689.
MS. TEETERS. But it also gives us the trigger for aconference call, which I think is useful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that they find the trigger for a conference call useful, suggesting agreement with its usefulness.


Passage number 690.
10/5/82MR. PARTEE. We don't need to have a trigger for a conferencecall. There could be another understanding.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that there is an alternative understanding or possibility regarding the need for a trigger for a conference call.


Passage number 691.
MS. TEETERS. The understanding could be when the federalfunds rate is below 7 percent or above 10 percent. We may not have toput it in the directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement by Ms. Teeters regarding the understanding of when the federal funds rate could be below 7 percent or above 10 percent.


Passage number 692.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. As we're meeting here, the federal fundsrate is roughly 10-1/2 percent. I guess I don't have any problem withleaving in the sentence if you want to and saying 7 to 10-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a factual statement about the current federal funds rate and does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 693.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I'm against it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker clearly states that they are against something, without any opposing viewpoint being presented.


Passage number 694.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It certainly seems a lot lessimportant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 695.
MR. WALLICH. If we drop it, that would convey less of aninterest-rate-oriented directive. And I think it's desirable to avoidbeing very specific about our interest rate [objective] here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, is simply expressing his opinion that it would be better to avoid being specific about their interest rate objective.


Passage number 696.
MR. CORRIGAN. Who knows how the market will interpret it. Ithink the other argument is just as likely: That the absence of itwould lead to the view that we really have zeroed in on a specificnumber. I don't know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker presents two different arguments without favoring one over the other.


Passage number 697.
MR. FORD. How about just saying that the fed funds rate willnot rise above 10-1/2 percent. Isn't that what we mean. Why not saywhat we mean if that's what we mean. I don't mean to be facetious,but if we wanted to convey the true feeling of the group, I thinkthat's what we mean, so why not say it. That would be conveyingaccurate information to the market as to what our objective is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and suggesting that they should accurately convey their objective to the market.


Passage number 698.
MR. MARTIN. Of course, if we say 7 to 10-1/2 percent, we'reconveying a little more information, which is that we might reallytolerate a low rate. That 7 percent might get their attention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply explains how stating a specific percentage might capture someone's attention.


Passage number 699.
MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it is not provided.


Passage number 700.
 MORRIS and MS. TEETERS. It was in there last month.SPEAKER(.).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 701.
 But of course, that's--MS. TEETERS. They haven't seen it yet, though, Frank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that someone has not yet seen something.


Passage number 702.
MR. GUFFEY. I would opt to have a funds rate range of 7 to10 percent; I would hope that it will be at 10 percent tomorrow andthat that would be the maximum we'd tolerate on the up side. I had asimilar question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Guffey's opinion on the preferred funds rate range.


Passage number 703.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Or lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 704.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, that's all right. We'll be theretomorrow. But the point is that the 7 percent is also an importantfigure to me. I would hate to see interest rates drop quickly if, forexample, we get very slow growth in M2--if that's what we aretargeting on or trying to use as the target. But 7 percent is equallyimportant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing the importance of the 7 percent figure to Mr. Guffey.


Passage number 705.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Following up on what Roger isimplying, I think the chief advantage of having a sentence on the-67-10/5/82range is that if--and I say if--the market reacts to this with greatuncertainty, this gives some sense of reassurance that we are notthinking of simply an all-out drop. I don't see that it's importantotherwise; I don't think it's much of a guide. But there is someadvantage of having it in, if we get an unfortunate interpretation. Idon't think, though, that we'd want to have 7 to 10-1/2 percent; Ithink we'd want 7 to 10 percent. I don't see what the problem is.
