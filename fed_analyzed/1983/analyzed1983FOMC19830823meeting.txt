****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 3.
MR. CROSS. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the given passage, there is an example of contention or disagreement. The presence of "[Statement--see Appendix" suggests that there is likely a disagreement or differing viewpoint present, as it indicates that there is additional information or evidence that may contradict or challenge the statement.


Passage number 4.
]VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What remaining foreign currencybalances does the Treasury have now after paying off the Carter bonds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is simply asking a factual question about the remaining foreign currency balances held by the Treasury. There is no contention or disagreement present.

Passage number 9.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a direct question and does not present any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 10.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I have a general comment tomake. I think there are two types of intervention: One is [based on]the modest, narrow concept of countering disorderly markets; the otheris when one wants to lean against stronger trends. And the secondreally should be done not only in concert with other key central banksbut in a package approach in which other actions--not justintervention--are taken. I think what was done fell between those twoschools. Now, it still had a useful purpose. I wouldn't agree withsome of the public comment that it was a complete failure. It had thepolitically useful--and I use the word politically in the verybroadest sense of the term--function of demonstrating that the UnitedStates was willing to meet its Williamsburg Summit commitments ofcooperation. And it certainly checked for a few days the very strongupward trend that seemed to be out of all proportion to the upwardmovement in U.S. [interest] rates. It's quite clear that it didn'tleave a good taste in people's mouths, although some people in themarket thought it was a useful thing to do. On balance, I think thegeneral consensus was that it didn't turn out to be very effective.Secondly, I think there was some irritation on the part of Europeancentral banks that on the key night, a Thursday night, we did notfollow through and do any intervention in the Far East--we had noauthority to do that--when there was a very major movement. And thisfollowed a day on which the Bundesbank on its own had asked thecentral banks of many small European countries to join in on theintervention. And, therefore, it left a rather bad taste in theirmouths and they later came out with this statement that Sam referredto, and I think that just about finished the possibility of any reallyeffective concerted intervention. I only make these comments to giveyou my perspective--a report card, so to speak, of this particularincident. I don't know whether Paul agrees or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker mentions disagreement between central banks about the effectiveness and timing of intervention in the market. This is evident in their comments about different approaches to intervention and the irritation felt by European central banks.


Passage number 11.
8/23/83MS. TEETERS. I didn't realize we didn't have the authorityto intervene in the Far East.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they were not aware that they lacked the authority to intervene in the Far East.


Passage number 12.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We're kept on a very close leash.When I first became Undersecretary of the Treasury and we had the needto intervene, Arthur Burns also would keep the New York Fed on a veryclose leash. That went on for a week or two. He would say that [theDesk] had $25 million and when they used it up they had to come back.And then there would be a consultation with the Treasury. I wasfollowing it very closely and I felt policy with that close a leashdidn't make any sense. So, I said to Arthur Burns that if we wereserious about it, we had to give the New York Desk more room; and heagreed finally. The Desk ended up having a very substantial amount ofdiscretion, including in the Far East, and also with not too small adollar amount. Frequently there was not a dollar limit as such. Justthe process of consultation alone [is cumbersome]. If we need tointervene and are getting close to the end of the money authorizationfor the day--[which might be] $25, $50, or $75 million depending onthe market--by the time we get through to the Treasury and theTreasury consults with the Chairman and then they get back to us, at aminimum that will be 20 minutes; sometimes it can be an hour or two.So, I personally feel that if it's a serious concerted intervention,we have to give a little more discretion to the Desk. I don't thinkthat view is very popular, certainly not in this Treasury. John.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, who is also the Undersecretary of the Treasury, is recounting a period of time when the New York Fed was kept on a close leash in terms of their intervention activities. The speaker ultimately suggests that giving the New York Desk more room and discretion would be a better approach. There is no disagreement or conflict between the speaker and anyone else mentioned in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 13.
MR. BALLES. I saw at least one press report that indicatedthe initial intervention by the Treasury was unilateral and did notinvolve coordination with any foreign central bank. I was just goingto ask, Tony, if it's a fair question: Is that true or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is contention or disagreement regarding the involvement of foreign central banks in the initial intervention by the Treasury. The question asked suggests that there may be differing opinions or information regarding this matter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 14.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No, I don't think that's true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. Although the response begins with "No," it is followed by an explanation that disagrees with the statement in the passage. Therefore, there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 15.
MR. CROSS. The first day that we intervened, which occurredrather late in the afternoon, it was intervention by the United States[only] but we had talked with the other central banks about what weintended to do. Then, subsequently, we were acting more or less inconcert.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the sequence of events and actions taken by the United States.


Passage number 16.
MR. BALLES. Well, as usual, the press got things screwed up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply stating the press made an error. There is no evident contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 17.
MR. CROSS. Yes, I saw some reports that were wrong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they saw some reports that were incorrect.


Passage number 18.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Now, what was a little unusual wasthat the Treasury went out and made an announcement. In hindsight,I'm not so sure that was a great idea. Normally that isn't the way wewould do it unless we were planning a very major effort, which we usedto do by activating swap lines, taking a monetary policy measure--whatI call a package approach. Then when we make an announcement, we getmore credibility. Anyway, that's a minor point. They announced it,or simply after a couple of days answered questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. The speaker is simply reflecting on a past event and expressing their thoughts and observations.


Passage number 19.
MR. ROBERTS. Question: Did I hear that the historical costof the currencies we own [is $4 billion and] the current value is $3billion. Does that mean an unrealized loss of a billion dollars oncurrencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a question and seeking clarification about the value of the currencies.


Passage number 20.
MR. TRUMAN. No, those are the Treasury's losses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is a direct response to a question and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 21.
8/23/83MR. ROBERTS. I mean for the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not include any indication of contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple statement or reference without any conflicting perspectives or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 22.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. But on the other hand, Ted, wehad made an enormous amount of money in our intervention. Just on theCarter bonds alone--selling those, which is done to get foreigncurrency--not only was there a large interest rate savings but therewas also a big profit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a contention or disagreement because the phrase "But on the other hand" implies that a conflicting viewpoint or opinion is about to be presented. The statement "we had made an enormous amount of money" suggests that there is a difference of opinion or perspective on the financial success of the intervention.


Passage number 23.
MR. ROBERTS. Where does all that flow through--the ExchangeStabilization Fund.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question being asked is a simple information-seeking question about the flow of funds.


Passage number 24.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, and the Exchange StabilizationFund when I was there was in the red. By the time I left it was inthe black because of the profits that we had made, even though not allof the profits went into the Stabilization Fund. Some of them endedup in the general account.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply provides information about the financial status of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.


Passage number 25.
MR. PARTEE. We have some book losses, though, don't we,Tony. That's my impression.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a question and does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply asks for confirmation or further information.


Passage number 26.
MR. TRUMAN. The Federal Reserve has about $830 million inunrealized losses at the moment, if you want to call it that. Butunrealized losses of the Treasury are about $900 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states the amount of unrealized losses for both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury without indicating disagreement or contention.


Passage number 27.
MR. FORD. So that I understand, I'm trying to summarize formyself what you said just now. Would it be fair to say that you'resaying either do it whole hog or don't do it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply trying to summarize and clarify what was said.


Passage number 28.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I think in a case of counteringdisorderly markets, in the very narrow sense of that term, we can dothat on modest basis. That involves more a quasi-continuing presencefrom time-to-time in the market without making a big deal out of it.The second type is concerted intervention or leaning against the wind,which was a situation that was posed to us because in the larger senseof the term one can argue that this was a very disorderly movement.The abruptness and the size of the market movement in response to arelatively modest uptick in U.S. interest rates was out of proportion.Yes, I feel that we shouldn't do that kind of major, concertedintervention unless there's a package approach and we really mean itand don't keep such a close hold on the Desk. That's my own view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing the speaker's personal view on the matter.


Passage number 29.
MR. PARTEE. But you would still sterilize it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement by Mr. Partee is a straightforward statement without any conflicting opinions or differing views.


Passage number 30.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Oh, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Oh, yes" is a simple affirmation or agreement without any opposition or conflicting viewpoint.


Passage number 31.
MS. TEETERS. Tony, what do you consider a majorintervention. This totaled $3.7 billion over those few weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. TEETERS is simply asking Tony a question about his perspective on a major intervention, and providing information about the amount of money involved.


Passage number 32.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Our share was $300 odd million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states that "Our share was $300 odd million" without any contradictory statements or conflicting perspectives.


Passage number 33.
MR. CROSS. Our share of the intervention was $250 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about the amount of money allocated for intervention.


Passage number 34.
MS. TEETERS. But the total intervention was just over $3.7billion. That looks big to me and just not on the proper scale.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and contemplating the scale of the intervention amount as being large.


Passage number 35.
MR. CROSS. Intervention by the Europeans and others was $2.4billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply provides a statement about the amount of intervention by the Europeans and others being $2.4 billion.


Passage number 36.
8/23/83MR. RICE. What was the total in 1978.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking for information about the total in 1978.


Passage number 37.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I can't give you a gross figure forall central banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve contention or disagreement. It simply states that the person cannot provide a specific figure for all central banks. There is no indication of a conflicting viewpoint.


Passage number 38.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The United States alone did billions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not contain any statements or ideas that would suggest contention or disagreement. It simply states that the United States did billions of something, without providing any context or further information.


Passage number 39.
MR. PARTEE. Yes. Of course, the dollar was weak.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Of course, the dollar was weak" is presented as a statement of agreement or affirmation.


Passage number 40.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We started off without foreigncurrencies so we had to activate the swaps, and I suppose we got inhock by about as much as $8 billion. Sometimes we have to stick withintervention. It's not an easy, simple, black and white thing. Forexample, when we announced that big dollar rescue package onNovember 1, [1978], even though we had a whole package of measures andeven though there was worldwide consultation and even though thedollar turned around very sharply on the first day, we had to make itstick and make the markets believe we meant business and that [what wewere doing] was credible. To give time for the fundamentalimprovement in our balance of payments to become more and moreapparent, we had to stick with substantial intervention all throughNovember and December. On January 2 the markets turned around ontheir own and then there was such an inflow that we were able to repayour swaps and over the year to begin accumulating foreign currenciesbecause the dollar was rising too fast. That was a situation where wehad very effective concerted tactics and yet still neededintervention. Sometimes I hear the argument that [if] it is aneffective concerted package which involves domestic monetary policy,then intervention isn't needed at all. That was a case where we didneed it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is describing a situation where intervention was necessary and effective in managing the foreign currency exchange. There is no opposition or differing viewpoint presented.


Passage number 41.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [We need to] ratify the transactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement suggests a need for ratifying transactions, indicating agreement or consensus rather than disagreement.


Passage number 42.
MS. TEETERS. So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the passage. The statement "So moved" is a phrase commonly used in meetings or discussions to indicate agreement or support for a motion.


Passage number 43.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection we will ratify thetransactions. Mr. Sternlight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "without objection" indicates that there is unanimous agreement to ratify the transactions. The mention of "Mr. Sternlight" also does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 44.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Statement--seeAppendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a statement and expressing gratitude.


Passage number 45.
][CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states "Questions" but does not provide any information that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 46.
]MR. BALLES. Yes, I have one, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to getPeter's perspective on the new wrinkle added--or should I sayreintroduced--at last month's meeting of the Committee, which was topay attention not just to borrowing but to excess reserves as well.In other words, we were going back to a free reserve or net borrowedreserve concept if I understood that correctly. Just from yourperspective, how if at all does that new wrinkle affect your abilityto carry out the Committee's instructions or goals.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question and asks for Peter's perspective on a new concept discussed in a previous meeting.


Passage number 47.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I think it worked satisfactorily inthis period. I don't know that it will always be that satisfactory.It depends on the behavior of excess reserves, which tended not to beas high this last period. They averaged a little over $400 million,and we were pretty much programming them in our path-building at the$350 million level. One week we moved that up to $400 million. If we8/23/83were to get weeks when there was a much stronger demand for excessreserves, it could be more troublesome to operate on that basis. Butit has not been a significant problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their perspective and expressing a potential concern for the future.


Passage number 48.
MR. BALLES. The reason I raised that question, Mr. Chairman,is that if you go back and look at the history of the relationship ofexcess reserves to the economy, it appears to me at least to betrendless and erratic. I would have to judge that any sustained moveto instruct the Desk to follow free reserve or net borrowed reservetargets would be counterproductive, and I would advise against it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 49.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know what the basis for thatis. I don't know whether one would get any better results followingborrowings alone; I would suspect not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses doubt and uncertainty about the effectiveness of following borrowings alone. They suggest that it is likely not the best approach but do not provide a clear basis for their skepticism.


Passage number 50.
MR. BALLES. Pay your money and take your choice, I guess.Personally, I'd have more faith in just following the borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It presents a personal opinion or perspective without conflicting with any other views.


Passage number 51.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I think there has been some rise [in excessreserves] this year; it abated a bit in just the last month or so. Weessentially have somewhat higher levels of excess this year thanearlier; and I tend to relate that to some of our Reserve Bankoperational reviews of overdrafts and things like that, which I thinkhave made some bankers want to hold higher levels of excess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 52.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. On another matter, in view of theexperience we've had in the last few weeks in the way the marketsabsorbed this large U.S. Treasury borrowing: You said earlier thatthere had been some econometric analysis indicating that if there weresubstantial reductions in the deficit, interest rates might be, say, acouple points lower. Was that analysis done on the basis of currentconditions in the economy or was that analysis based upon a morerobust economy or higher utilization of capacity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question seeking clarification about the basis of the earlier mentioned econometric analysis.


Passage number 53.
MR. KICHLINE. It was done taking the quarterly econometricmodel and keyed off what was the equivalent of the staff's forecast--the one that we had prepared in July--and then taking a $50 billionexpenditure cut. We also did it with a $50 billion tax increase.Essentially the starting point, the initial conditions, would be theJuly staff forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining a process that was carried out, stating the use of the econometric model and the application of a $50 billion expenditure cut and a $50 billion tax increase. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 54.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. So, common sense would tell me thatif a year from now the economy were functioning at a much higher levelof utilization of capacity and you did the same econometric analysis--and at that time we got a major move to reduce the budgetary deficit--we would get an even bigger impact in terms of interest ratereduction. Is that a sensible conclusion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing a logical conclusion based on hypothetical scenarios and potential outcomes.


Passage number 55.
MR. KICHLINE. I think, unfortunately, that's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply agrees with the statement that was made.


Passage number 56.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Why "unfortunately".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The word "unfortunately" is used to express a personal opinion or sentiment of the writer, indicating a negative view or disappointment. It does not introduce any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 57.
MR. KICHLINE. One of the problems with these exercises isthat they are all dependent on the structure of the model one isusing. Use a different model and get a different answer. It alsodepends on initial conditions. In our model it's a non-linearrelationship so that we get a bigger bang for the buck as we getcloser to potential or full capacity utilization.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating that the outcome of the exercises depends on the model and initial conditions.


Passage number 58.
8/23/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why is that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage provided. The passage simply states a date (8/23/83) and asks a question ("Why is that"), but it does not present any conflicting opinions or conflicting statements.


Passage number 59.
MR. KICHLINE. It has to do with the non-linear demand formoney function, essentially. The elasticity of money varies overtime, and in that model as we get closer to capacity utilization,short-term rates would be rising substantially. And if you take theheat off in absolute terms--and this is done absolutely, the number ofbasis points involved--short-term rates would drop more than theywould otherwise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining a concept and does not involve any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 60.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Peter may not agree with me, but whatthe experience of the last few weeks--with this very large Treasuryborrowing in the markets--indicated to me at least is that the otherfactors swamped, or were more important than, the size of theborrowing in ultimately determining the level of interest rates in themarkets. So, even though in the early stages of the borrowing therewere considerable interest rate pressures geared to the size of theborrowing, the whole amount got digested very easily with interestrates ultimately coming down somewhat because of other factors. Itwasn't the size per se that caused that much of a problem in theoverall context of current conditions and perceptions about monetarypolicy. I don't know if you would agree with that or not, Peter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that Peter may not agree with their analysis of the situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 61.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I don't entirely. I think the size was afactor in the extent to which the market backed up. It came downagain very fast, but I think it may be premature to say that themarket has really digested this; it may be regurgitated again, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, Mr. Sternlight expresses a difference of opinion or uncertainty about whether the market has fully digested the situation and whether it may experience further complications in the future.


Passage number 62.
MR. PARTEE. Of course, we're talking about a very largefinancing. I guess it's true of the particular set of financing thatoccurred, but my recollection of the statistics is that both the monthof July and the third quarter show substantially reduced federalfinancing compared to the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of someone's recollection of statistics.


Passage number 63.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The third quarter is going to beabout $50 billion, isn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents a question about the projected value of the third quarter without expressing any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 64.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It is reduced, seasonally adjusted, fromthe very high seasonally adjusted amount in the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the amount is reduced, seasonally adjusted, from a higher amount in the second quarter. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 65.
MR. PARTEE. It was $65 billion or something like that in thesecond quarter. And as a matter of fact, total credit expansion inJuly, for which the Bluebook reports a number, is down considerably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the total credit expansion being down in July.


Passage number 66.
MR. GRAMLEY. Generally speaking, $50 billion a quarter iswhat we'll be looking at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley is stating a general statement about the amount of money they will be looking at.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 67.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is because the second quarter was sohigh; I think that's an illusion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "I think that's an illusion" indicates that the speaker is expressing a different opinion or perspective than what was previously mentioned about the second quarter being high.


Passage number 68.
MR. PARTEE. Well, that may be because they also had all thattax-exempt financing that went into governments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about tax-exempt financing that went into governments.


Passage number 69.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No other questions. We'll ratify thetransactions. Without objection. Mr. Kichline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states that there are no other questions, and the transactions will be ratified without objection. There is no indication of differing opinions or conflicting viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 70.
MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The statement is not given in the passage, so there is no way to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 71.
]8/23/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [The floor is] now open for questions andcomments and disagreements and alternative scenarios.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The inclusion of "disagreements" suggests that there may be differing opinions or conflicting views among the speakers or participants in the discussion.


Passage number 72.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You seem to be assuming that nextyear we will have a downward drift in long-term interest rates,notwithstanding the improved economy, etc.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is stating a perception or assumption about the future direction of long-term interest rates, specifically that they may decrease despite positive factors like an improved economy.


Passage number 73.
MR. KICHLINE. That's right. The rates in the forecast arein Appendix I of the Bluebook. We do have in there, for example, inthe mortgage area about a percentage point reduction in rates from thefourth quarter of this year to the end of 1984. We have had this kindof pattern for a while. We also have corporate bond rates driftingdown. It comes out of our forecast; it's sort of an iterativeprocedure. But our major view is that inflation will still be quitemild and that indeed, with the slowing of nominal GNP growth that weforesee, we could have a little drifting down of short rates and stillmeet the Committee's targets and that the good inflation performanceover time ought to show through in some reduction in long rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and expressing their viewpoint on inflation and interest rates.


Passage number 74.
MR. PARTEE. Now short rates are down too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply states that short rates are down.


Passage number 75.
MR. KICHLINE. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage consists of a single statement that does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 76.
MR. WALLICH. And this would be about a constant real rate,given some decline in inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement made by Mr. Wallich is simply discussing the possibility of a constant real rate given a decline in inflation. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 77.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, we have a decline in real rates impliedbecause inflation this year and next year is about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states a fact about the decline in real rates implied by inflation being about the same for this year and next year. There is no conflicting opinion or argument presented.


Passage number 78.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. An act of faith.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "an act of faith" does not provide enough context to determine if there is any contention or disagreement. It simply refers to the action or expression of faith, without suggesting any conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 79.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, in large part.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any explicit contention or disagreement. It is incomplete, but the provided portion does not indicate any conflicting opinions or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 80.
MR. PARTEE. [Unintelligible] starting it; there's noquestion about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 81.
MR. KICHLINE. Maybe even when it's econometrically derived,it's an act of faith.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that even when something is derived using econometrics, it may still require an act of faith.


Passage number 82.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any forecast is an act of faith.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that any forecast is an act of faith. There is no contention or disagreement presented in the statement.


Passage number 83.
MR. GUFFEY. I'd like to step back. You spoke of next year'srates. [In the Bluebook appendix] an increase in rates is shown inthe fourth quarter, which I assume is built into your Greenbookforecast. Can you comment on the background of that assumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply requesting information and asking for clarification.


Passage number 84.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I might note that a good part ofmy briefing is devoted to these questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no mention of any disagreement or contention in the passage. The statement simply mentions that a significant portion of the briefing is focused on the mentioned questions.


Passage number 85.
MR. GUFFEY. I'll wait.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a single statement made by Mr. Guffey, indicating that he is willing to wait. There is no contention or disagreement present in this statement.


Passage number 86.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 87.
MR. BALLES. I have a healthy respect for the forecastproduced by the Board staff. In light of yesterday's discussion, Ifeel it necessary to "fess up," as it were: We [in San Francisco] dohave a significantly different forecast, though not for this year,where we come in very close to the [Board staff] forecast. By the8/23/83time we get to 1984 there is a difference that I feel compelled tocomment on. I'll try to explain very briefly why. On real GNP, theBoard staff reduced its forecast for the end of '83 to the end of '84fractionally this time. They were at 4.2 percent in July and they'reat 4 percent in the latest revision; so, they're down fractionally.We had already been higher than they were in our July forecast, whichwas a 5.1 percent increase. Our staff, rightly or wrongly, has nowupped that to a 5.8 percent real GNP gain fourth quarter-to-fourthquarter. In trying to track down the differences--because what Iexpect every time from my staff is some explanation or attemptedreconciliation of differences between their forecast and that of theBoard staff--it gets down to the basic methodology. The Board staffhas a model that's driven by M2 and we're old fashioned enough to beback to using Ml. The reason I feel compelled to comment on this isthat I have in front of me a chart that shows the relationship betweenM2 and personal income going back quite a ways. It tracked prettywell up until 1978 when all these things began to happen to rates paidon various components of the Ms. Since that time any relationshipbetween M2 and income is just invisible. In fact, they quite often goin opposite directions. We have some faith that we're about to see arestoration of normal velocity patterns in Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing different forecasts and the reasons behind the differences, but there is no argument or disagreement between the parties involved.


Passage number 88.
MR. PARTEE. Does Ml look better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not demonstrate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 89.
MR. BALLES. Yes, except obviously for 1982, when it justfell out of bed and was hopeless. What we're expecting--and it's aforecast not a fact--is that we're in the process of seeing therestoration of the normal velocity trend in Ml which, if realized bythe fourth quarter as we forecast, would mean a considerably fastergrowth of the economy going into 1984. Our specific monetaryassumption is that for the balance of this year Ml will grow at theupper end of its range and that as we move into 1984 it will grow inthe middle of the 4 to 8 percent range. I think your forecast, Jim,was based on M2 in the middle of the range both for the balance ofthis year and next year. So, it's simply the difference inmethodologies. All sorts of details, of course, would have to beexplored, but just in a gross sense that's why we come out with adifferent forecast. Since we have stronger real growth, we have lessunemployment. Time will tell which of these views is correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker explains that they have a different forecast based on different methodologies and outlooks for M1 and M2 growth. They mention that time will tell which view is correct, implying a disagreement over the outlook for economic growth.


Passage number 90.
MR. CORRIGAN. What does that forecast have for inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking a question about the forecast for inflation.


Passage number 91.
MR. BALLES. It's a little more than the Board staff has.Specifically, they're expecting 4.3 percent this year, fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, versus our 5.1 percent; next year they're at 4.4percent and we're at 5.2 percent.SPEAKER(.). What about the interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 92.
MR. BALLES. We don't forecast interest rates. We don't knowhow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents disagreement because Mr. Balles states that they do not forecast interest rates, but the implication is that the speaker may believe that they should forecast interest rates.


Passage number 93.
MR. WALLICH. Do you assume that velocity will grow at thesame old rate hereafter or is it a reduced but stable rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 94.
MR. BALLES. We assume velocity will approximate itshistorical growth rate more than what we saw in 1982. I'm not sure--Idon't think anybody can be, Henry--that it's going to come back right8/23/83on or somewhere around the historical average, but it's certain tobounce back and be reasonably similar to what it used to be--up 2 or 3percent a year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 95.
MR. FORD. I'm just looking at the trend for the last fourquarters: Starting with the third quarter of 1982, Ml has grown by6.1, 13, 14, and 12 percent and nominal GNP [growth] was well below itfor the first three of those four quarters. Then in the last quarter,the second quarter of this year, velocity has finally made a comebackand is now running ahead. That reinforces in my thinking what John issaying about the likelihood of a rebound toward more normal velocity.What worries me was that we could really see this surge. M1 wassurging way ahead of nominal GNP and now all of a sudden nominal GNPhas zoomed ahead on a concurrent basis. That obviously isn't theright way to look at it, but that's the way a lot of people aroundhere have been talking about it for the last few quarters. So, if youwant to continue talking in that vein, we should now be concernedabout the fact that the second-quarter nominal GNP went up by 13percent when Ml went up by a little less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Ford, expresses concern about the surge in M1 compared to nominal GNP. He mentions that some people have been talking about it in a certain way for the last few quarters, suggesting that there might be disagreement or differing perspectives on the issue.


Passage number 96.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Coming back to the real economy, Jim:What level of housing starts and what level of automobile sales areyou assuming for the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 97.
MR. KICHLINE. Housing we have at 1.55 million units at anannual rate; that would be down from our guess of 1.65 million unitsfor the current quarter, which entails some decline for August andSeptember. So, we have a further drop of 100,000 units in the fourthquarter. For auto sales in the fourth quarter we're assuming 9-3/4million units in total, of which domestic sales would be 7.4 million,and that's about where they've been running in the first half of thisquarter to date. We have domestic auto sales at this higher level butnot rising further.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides information and forecasts about housing and auto sales, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 98.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I would guess, although it's nothingother than gut instinct, that those levels are somewhat optimistic.Housing transactions are beginning to fall. And as the pent up demandfor automobiles begins to be satisfied to some degree, I have afeeling that that's a very high level of automobile sales to beprojecting for the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing personal opinions and gut instincts about housing transactions and automobile sales projections, but there is no contradictory information or opposing viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 99.
MR. MARTIN. I would join Tony only in the comment onhousing. I was convinced yesterday that the interest concessions havebeen so narrow in automobile financing that their removal is not goingto be a material factor in the fourth quarter. But I would argue thathousing in the fourth quarter will be down more likely by 200,000 to250,000 than 100,000 units. The cancellation rates in the escrows inDallas, Chicago, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlantaare such that the sales will not be completed. The rates are floatingup 150 and in some cases 200 basis points. Those sales are just notgoing to be closed and that, of course, will back up into starts andother housing figures. So, as usual, I would indicate a deeper,further degree of pessimism on the housing front.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in the passage. Mr. Martin disagrees with Tony's statement on housing and argues that housing in the fourth quarter will be down by more units than Tony suggests. He provides evidence for his viewpoint by mentioning the high cancellation rates in multiple cities and predicts that this will negatively impact sales and housing figures.


Passage number 100.
MR. ROBERTS. Are you referring to single-family primarily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and does not express any conflicting opinions.


Passage number 101.
MR. MARTIN. New single-family homes primarily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It simply states that new single-family homes primarily belong to married couples.


Passage number 102.
8/23/83MR. ROBERTS. Isn't there some increase in the multifamilyarea that is partially offsetting that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a straightforward statement without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 103.
MR. MARTIN. Yes, but there, Ted, we have the condition ofhigh vacancy rates for apartments in the major markets in the Sunbeltand a very low household formation rate in 1982. There is somecontroversy about what the formation rate was last year; some peoplesay there wasn't any for the first time in twenty-five years orsomething like that. I think that's a bit too pessimistic, but theBoard's staff indicated that it's several hundred thousand households.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply discussing different factors and viewpoints related to high vacancy rates for apartments and low household formation rates.


Passage number 104.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Is that because of the demographicsor because people aren't getting married, or what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply posing questions and does not express any disagreement or contention. It is seeking to understand the reasons behind a certain phenomenon.


Passage number 105.
MR. MARTIN. The staff comment yesterday [at the Boardbriefing referred to] the impact of the recession. I think it goesbeyond that. I think there are some changes. Some younger folks arestaying with Momma and Poppa a little longer and I think there's adefinite slowing in the rate of [household] formation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is simply stating his own opinion and observations about the impact of the recession and the changes he perceives in household formation. There is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 106.
MR. PARTEE. They are spending their money on a new car.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that someone is using their money to buy a new car.


Passage number 107.
MR. MARTIN. Or a new computer. Then there's a question, ofcourse, of the thrift industry problems, if any, at today's interestrates. We had some work done here a while back--I'm not sure that Jimwould still underline that work--in which we second guessed the thriftindustry economists and it came down to this: A very rough figure of100 basis points in weighted average costs for the thrifts means apre-tax impact of about $1 billion. If you remember the rise in ratessince June, which is the month in which we received those data fromthe thrifts and translated that into a post-tax profitability, [itmeans that] they don't have any [profit]. And, of course, for thesavings banks you get a figure that's in the red. But some of you inyour own Districts know that picture of the savings banks a lot betterthan I do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily discussing the issue of thrift industry problems and the impact of interest rates on their profitability.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 108.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I thought John Balles was going tomake my speech for me. He started off pretty much the same way, butwe come out with less real growth next year than he did, though a tadmore than the Board staff is projecting. The main difference is thatas we looked at prices next year, we paid right much attention to thebehavior of money in recent months in addition to the effects, as theBoard staff suggested, of a great firming of labor markets, adepreciation of the dollar, and the drought this year. And we believethat's going to result in somewhat higher prices than the staff isprojecting. If I figured it right, they have the implicit deflator[rising] about 4-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of '83 to thefourth quarter of '84; we think [the increase] might be near 6percent. That's really the significant difference between us andJohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black states that he and John have different projections for real growth and inflation rates. He specifically mentions that they differ in their views on the effects of money behavior, labor markets, dollar depreciation, and the drought on prices.


Passage number 109.
MR. PARTEE. You have prices and he has real growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that one person has prices while the other person has real growth.


Passage number 110.
MR. BALLES. I like mine better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "I like mine better" simply expresses a personal preference without indicating any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 111.
MR. BLACK. I hasten to add that I hope we [are wrong]. Ithought we were going to end up the same place but that's exactly thedifference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It reflects the speaker's personal hope for a particular outcome but acknowledges the potential for a different result.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 112.
-10-8/23/83MR. KEEHN. By way of a District report, I must say thateconomic conditions in the Middle West are very significantly improvedand would be broadly consistent with the outline that Jim has given[for the nation]. The only point I'd make--and I think Jim used thephrase "capital goods are poised for recovery"--is that the people whoare running the major capital goods firms in the Middle West reallyare becoming very, very discouraged by the outlook. I'm now talkingabout the heavy capital side: foundry equipment, railroad equipment,and heavy trucks. Though things may look a little better off a veryweak base, people on that side of life are becoming terriblydiscouraged that 1983 is by now largely gone and the early part of1984 is to a large extent gone as well. Most of them say the earliestthey expect recovery is in late 1984. So, they continue to be verypessimistic. Perhaps that's typical for this point in a recovery but,as a consequence of all this, our outlook for 1984 would be modestlylower than the Board staff's outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing pessimism about the outlook for the capital goods industry in the Middle West, while the Board staff's outlook is more optimistic.


Passage number 113.
MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, I sense a somewhat different tonedeveloping at this meeting in regard to where the economy is goingthan I detected at the last meeting. We have seen some signs ofslowing in retail sales, although it's hard to assess what one month'snumbers mean. Prospectively, in housing we've heard a lotqualitatively about the slowdown in mortgage applications and so on.Still in all, I think it's wise to recall that if anyone had forecast6 months ago that we were going to be looking at a 9 percent real GNPgrowth in the second quarter and 8 percent in the third, he would havebeen considered slightly off his rocker. [The expansion] hasdeveloped much, much more strongly than nearly everybody had foreseen.In my judgment, probably the best single analogy one can use for theeconomy is that of the fly wheel: What happened in this quarter isgoing to happen in the next one. My guess, if I had to make one,would be that we're more likely to see somewhat faster growth than thestaff has forecast for 1984. And I think the big candidate for anoverrun is business investment. It's something I cannot pin downexcept to say that the increase in contracts and orders for plant andequipment in the past two quarters has been very, very substantial,but I have a hunch that more is developing in this area than what wasallowed for.Still in all, if I had to put out a forecast, it wouldn't bedrastically different from what the staff has for next year. It mightbe a half point more or something like that, but certainly nothingthat would change in major ways the outlook for employment and forprices. One of the things that we do need to think about and concernourselves with is what may be happening in the food area. The staffhas a 7 percent rise in food prices fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter.Unless we get some rain of substantial magnitude soon, it could be alot more than that. It would be worrisome if that got built into theunderlying inflation. It's awfully hard to keep that from happening.I'm not quite sure what to do about it, but I worry about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing his personal judgment and speculation about the state of the economy and potential future growth.


Passage number 114.
MR. PARTEE. Seed the clouds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. The speaker, Mr. Partee, states a suggestion or proposal to "seed the clouds." There is no indication of any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 115.
MR. MORRIS. Some work I've done is supportive of yourfeeling on the capital goods sector. I've compared the currentexpansion to the expansion of 1975-76 and in general the broadmeasures show that we're tracking very closely to that expansion. Onesector that is different, even though the capital goods people in the-11-8/23/83Middle West may not appreciate it at the moment, is that capital goodsorders are coming in much stronger than they did at the correspondingphase of the 1975-76 expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Morris, is stating that his work supports the feeling on the capital goods sector and that the current expansion is similar to the one in 1975-76. He also mentions that capital goods orders are stronger now compared to the corresponding phase of the previous expansion.


Passage number 116.
MR. RICE. Isn't the composition different, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Rice is asking a question and seeking clarification, not expressing disagreement or starting a debate.


Passage number 117.
MR. KEEHN. It's a different segment of the capital goodsside. I'm talking about machine tools, foundry equipment; I don'tthink perhaps you are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Keehn is simply expressing his viewpoint on the topic of machine tools and foundry equipment. There is no opposing viewpoint presented.


Passage number 118.
MR. MORRIS. But doesn't that side hit the lag in any event.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by Mr. Morris.


Passage number 119.
MR. KEEHN. Perhaps so, but it has been lagging so long thatthe guys are getting awfully discouraged. For example, to give youjust one quick figure: The delivery of railroad cars this year willbe 5,000 units. It typically runs about 80,000 to 85,000 units and in1980 it ran 120,000. This year's figure will be lower than any yearsince 1933 and I'm not sure the figures in 1933 were that good. Thisprovides the kind of environment in which people are thinking andthey've become very discouraged about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply presents statistics and observations about the low delivery of railroad cars, which is causing discouragement among people.


Passage number 120.
MR. PARTEE. Is there some increase in orders.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asked by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 121.
MR. KEEHN. No, orders have been absolutely flat. Now, thereare some reasons for that; nonetheless, it provides a very difficultenvironment in which people are operating.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact and providing an explanation for it.


Passage number 122.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Union Pacific people tell me thatcarloadings have not gone up as much as the rest of the economy andnormal relationships would indicate, although the published data don'tseem to make that very clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The author mentions that Union Pacific people claim that carloadings have not increased as much as expected based on normal relationships with the rest of the economy, but the author also acknowledges that the published data may not clearly support this claim. However, there is no explicit dispute or contradiction presented.


Passage number 123.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. While I was on the phone the other day Iwas looking at Business Week, which has this business indicator[measure] on the front page. They compared last month to two monthsago and last year, and they had a comparison with five or seven yearsago. They included the steel industry, which is running 40 percentbelow the figures of five years ago. Every other industry theyincluded was up 30 to 40 percent compared to whatever it was 5 or 7years ago. There's a tremendous contrast between what is going on insteel, as reflected in that, and in the rest of the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating the facts and observations from the Business Week article without expressing any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 124.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The barge business is also very, verybad. It has not picked up. There seems to be less movement of coal,heavy material, steel, and even of grain. But coming back to foodprices: I thought we were sitting with such huge surpluses. I'm notquite sure I understand why there is such a big price impact.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their observation and confusion about the current state of the barge business and food prices.


Passage number 125.
MR. GRAMLEY. We are, in wheat. But the inventories of cornand soybeans are going to be quite low. If the crop forecast isreduced much further, I think we will get some liquidation oflivestock herds, hogs and cattle both, and then a very large run-up ofmeat prices next year. That is the big risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing a statement about the potential consequences if the crop forecast is reduced, leading to low inventories of corn and soybeans. They mention the possible liquidation of livestock herds and a subsequent increase in meat prices as a risk.


Passage number 126.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
As an AI language model, I am unable to see or perceive anything visually. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement present in this statement.


Passage number 127.
 So, it's meat prices ratherthan corn that you think---12-8/23/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just the feeling that everybody buys,including the Russians.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents a possible thought or belief about meat prices and corn without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 128.
MR. GUFFEY. Just to follow up on that comment: Our peoplehad [forecast] an increase in food prices in 1984 of about 5 to 6percent until this drought really hit the corn and small grain crops;now they've moved it up to 7 percent or a little over. And the reasonthe rise is only that modest is the fact that in the early part of1984 there will be a liquidation of red meat [animals], both hogs andcattle. As a result there will be a depressed meat price and theimpact on food prices won't occur until later in 1984. So, the yearlycontribution to inflation [from the food] price increase will bemodest--in the 7 percent range. But by the end of 1984 quite likelywe'll see food prices rising much more rapidly than 7 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of the speaker's analysis and forecast regarding the increase in food prices due to the drought and the liquidation of red meat animals.


Passage number 129.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they'll get that new crop in by theend of 1984.SPEAKER(.). Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 130.
MR. PARTEE. Then people will stop liquidating their meatanimals and that will really push meat prices up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is suggesting that if people stop liquidating their meat animals, it will cause an increase in meat prices.


Passage number 131.
MR. GUFFEY. As somebody observed, the PIK program was illdevised but what they also missed was Mother Nature being aparticipant in it. It essentially has been much more effective inbringing down the excess stocks of corn and other crops that normallywould be harvested in the fall than anybody ever imagined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 132.
MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have a different forecast,which I've had since February. I did have growth of 8-3/4 percent forone quarter, but I think interest rates at these levels will calm downthe economy, bringing it to the levels we had previous to the lastrun-up during the fall. And my real [GNP] forecast for next year isat the bottom of the FOMC [members' range]. I think [GNP growth] willprobably slow down to below 4 percent, fourth quarter-over-fourthquarter, which will both reduce the inflation rate and increaseunemployment next year. We don't have a stable relationship onvelocity. It may return. Until it does, it seems to me that what ismore important is the level of rates and what that does to economicperformance. So, I'm anticipating a much slower recovery, with allthe consequences that go with that slower rate of growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Teeters presents a different forecast and predicts a slower rate of growth and increased unemployment, while the prevailing view among FOMC members is a more optimistic forecast.


Passage number 133.
MR. ROBERTS. Since that hasn't been true up to now--realrates have not slowed the growth at all--why will it be true later inthe year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply referring to a fact stating that real rates have not slowed growth up to now and questioning why they would be expected to do so later in the year.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 134.
MS. TEETERS. I think there was a great deal of pent updemand, particularly in the housing and automobile areas, that cameout in the early parts of the recovery. As that pent up demand is metand as the rate [increases are felt]--obviously, [housing] is verysensitive to a mortgage rate somewhere between 12-1/2 and 14 percent--we also are going to run out of people who qualify for mortgages atthis level or even at 12-1/2 percent as we move further into therecovery. So, I think that we will see a moderation in housing demandand that automobile demand probably will moderate also. GM, as youknow, raised its prices about 2 percent today. Well, 2 percent, giventhe level they're starting from, makes the real cost of owning an-13-8/23/83automobile very high and rising. And I think people are responding tothat in a very economic way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Teeters, suggests that there will be a moderation in housing and automobile demand due to the increase in mortgage rates and the rising cost of owning a car. This implies that there may be a decrease in consumer buying power. Others may disagree with this viewpoint and believe that demand will remain strong or that other factors will mitigate the effects of the increases in rates and costs.


Passage number 135.
MR. ROBERTS. We should keep in mind, though, that thehousing recovery started at a higher level of mortgage rates thanyou're suggesting would be a problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts is simply stating a different perspective or point to consider.


Passage number 136.
MS. TEETERS. Well, it means that more people who couldqualify have been wiped out already.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Ms. Teeters about a situation.


Passage number 137.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Did you really have an 8 percentthird-quarter projection back in February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage states a question about a specific event or projection, without any conflicting opinions or contrasting viewpoints.


Passage number 138.
MS. TEETERS. No, for the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that there is no disagreement for the second quarter according to Ms. Teeters.


Passage number 139.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Even when you were so worried aboutinterest rates back in February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that the person being addressed was worried about interest rates in February.


Passage number 140.
MS. TEETERS. Yes. It was obvious what the inventories weregoing to do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information or context to suggest that there is any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement by Ms. Teeters about her observation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 141.
MR. PARTEE. I sort of agree with Nancy but for differentreasons. And that is--though I realize Jim has put the saving rateback [up] some--that I just think the projected saving rate is toolow. For the projection period it's around 4-1/2 percent as we gothrough 1984. I think that's an extraordinarily low rate. And it'snot consistent with all the incentives to save that the government hasprovided with IRAs and deferred compensation. I'm not sure whetherthe problem is that income is being understated--it could be--in theforecast. But that means stronger plant and equipment or something toprovide the income that will make for a higher saving rate. Or maybeconsumption is too high. I realize that people, because of pent updemand, can go in and use credit actively and draw down theirfinancial assets in order to take care of their needs; [but] as soonas that's over, I should think that the saving rate would be around 6percent. Therefore, I would come in with a little lower forecast forthe year from the fourth quarter of '83 to the fourth quarter of '84--certainly lower than John Balles has, and lower I think than Lyle has.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee disagrees with the projected saving rate and believes it is too low. He suggests that the government's incentives to save should result in a higher saving rate than what is projected.


Passage number 142.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. How much of the increased spending doyou attribute to the stock market and bonds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a question asking for an attribution or explanation. It does not involve any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 143.
MR. KICHLINE. I can't answer explicitly in terms of anumber. I don't know what the model has on that; I don't remember. Ido think that part of what we saw in the second quarter was a wealtheffect, and that was important in the kind of forecast that we have.It's hard to see stock prices zooming on up in the near term; thatmarket has cooled a bit. So, I would use that wealth effect argumentas helping to explain the second quarter. And that [effect] isweakening now, given what is happening in the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the wealth effect was an important factor in the forecast for the second quarter, while also stating that the market has cooled and the wealth effect is weakening. This indicates a contradiction and differing viewpoints.


Passage number 144.
MR. MARTIN. Jim, in terms of wealth effects for middleincome consumers, their assets are tied up in a single-familyresidence, which they can't sell. In city after city those people aresitting there with a number on paper or in their minds as to what theequity in their home is and they can't realize it. So, I wonder howimportant the stock market is to the middle of the pyramid.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Martin about the potential impact of the stock market on middle-income consumers.

Passage number 149.
MR. FOUSEK.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I can't provide a response without a passage or context. Could you please provide the passage or give more information?


Passage number 150.
 Of the excess increase of the--MR. FORD. It seems high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact or observation about something being high without indicating any disagreement or further discussion.

Passage number 153.
MR. FOUSEK.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 154.
 Well, all our past relationships would havesuggested about half--MR. MARTIN. And what was the offsetting decrease. I don'thave our [forecast] here so I can't--. There was a decrease in thevalue of the equity of housing of $30 to $40 billion for households.Is there an offset. They have a perception of a decrease in theirwealth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply providing a specific time frame without any conflicting information or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 160.
MR. MARTIN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is impossible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage with just the provided fragment "MR. MARTIN." This fragment does not provide enough context or information to make a judgment.


Passage number 161.
 I believe that's exactly--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Housing prices [were] firm.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a belief or opinion about housing prices being firm.


Passage number 162.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think the statistics show that householdwealth has gone up somewhere between 3/4 of a trillion and a trilliondollars in the past year, taking the two things together. Now, thedistribution of this is another question. But certainly the householdwealth statistics have looked much, much better in the past year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply presents statistics about household wealth increasing in the past year without any contradictory information or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 163.
 Howmuch of that one can really expect to influence consumption is hard tosay because it is rather narrowly distributed among a small---15-8/23/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You have to look at the volume ofrefinancing of existing house mortgages to begin to get some kind ofclue as to whether it influences consumer spending or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating that it is difficult to determine the extent to which refinancing of house mortgages influences consumer spending and suggests looking at the volume of refinancing as a clue. There is no clear contention or disagreement expressed in this statement.


Passage number 164.
MR. PARTEE. And there you're talking about 14 percentinterest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply mentions the topic of "14 percent interest rates" without expressing any conflicting views or opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 165.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've had a number of different viewsexpressed here about the outlook. Out of curiosity, how many peoplewould have a forecast significantly higher than the staff forecast. Iwill define significantly higher as roughly 1/2 percent or more on therate of growth over the next 18 months. [Secretary's note: Messrs.Balles, Black, Gramley, Ms. Horn, Mr. Morris, and perhaps a fewothers.] How many would have a significantly lower forecast.[Secretary's note: Messrs. Partee, Rice, and Ms. Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

There is disagreement in the passage as different views are expressed about the outlook. Some individuals have a forecast significantly higher than the staff forecast, while others have a significantly lower forecast.


Passage number 166.
]VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There are a couple of us left whomore or less agree with it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that there are a couple of people who agree with something, implying an absence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 167.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think that's quite possible. Whydon't we turn to Mr. Axilrod.

]MR. BOEHNE. Steve, what has been the pattern of growth forthe old M1A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking a question about the pattern of growth, indicating a desire for information.


Passage number 170.
MR. AXILROD. The quarterly figures, starting with the thirdquarter of 1982 are: 2.4 percent; 7.8 percent; 5.6 percent--held downby shifts, I think, but I don't know the exact amounts--and 6.7percent. And it looks like Q3 1983 will be 6.9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the quarterly figures without expressing any disagreement or debate.


Passage number 171.
MR. BOEHNE. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 172.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other questions. Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 173.
 Axilrod answeredall the possible--MR. BALLES. Steve, may I ask: What is your velocityforecast or expectation for Ml for the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question asked is a straightforward request for Steve's velocity forecast or expectation for Ml for the fourth quarter.


Passage number 174.
MR. AXILROD. It's around 2 percent or that order ofmagnitude for current M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a statement about the percentage of M1 without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 175.
MR. BALLES. The historical average was how much higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply presents information about the historical average without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 176.
MR. AXILROD. Well, if you use Ml without NOW accounts, whichis what we used to have, the history is that in the fourth quarter ofa recovery, its growth is around 7 percent or something like that.Take out [unintelligible] and it'll be lower--more like 6 to 7percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing a historical fact about the growth rate of M1 without NOW accounts during the fourth quarter of a recovery.


Passage number 177.
MR. BALLES. True, but is that a fair comparison.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any statement or indication of contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges a point and questions if it is a fair comparison.


Passage number 178.
 That iskind of old M1 with--MR. AXILROD. No, that's what I was trying to say. I don'tthink it is. I don't think you would then reason that the 2 percentis too low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individuals in the conversation are clarifying and expressing their opinions.


Passage number 179.
-16-8/23/83MR. BALLES. What I'm trying to get is: What would be thecomparable figure of the old Ml velocity given the new M1 content.Would it be 3 percent or 2 percent or what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a direct question and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 180.
MR. MORRIS. We don't know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a statement by Mr. Morris expressing uncertainty about something. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in the statement.


Passage number 181.
MR. BALLES. I'm just trying to smoke out, if we can, whatSteve meant by "velocity is recovering but it will remain low." Ithink those are the words you used.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a straightforward inquiry to clarify the meaning of a statement.


Passage number 182.
MR. AXILROD. What I meant was, if you go back to historywhen Ml had a different composition, the numbers in the fourth quarterof a recovery run around 5 or 6 or 7 percent. What we have now, basedon our current estimates, is something on the order of 2 percent,which will mean GNP doesn't pick up and Ml doesn't pick up with it.If you use the old M1A, you'd have something like 4 or 5 percent,which would be more in line with past cycles. It just says it's somesort of a residual transaction element if this keeps up and old M1A ismoving like it used to. One conclusion I drew from that is that thenew Ml does have this additional element, which is holding down itsvelocity. So, one might not want to extrapolate from that to highernominal GNP a few quarters ahead. Velocity is behaving a littledifferently; that could change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the differences in numbers and compositions of M1 and M1A and how they impact the velocity and potential growth of the nominal GNP.


Passage number 183.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ford.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage.


Passage number 184.
MR. FORD. Since you asked yesterday for some comparisons: Idon't know how many of the models you follow, but we do that all thetime. And I feel great listening to Steve and Jim and so on, if onecan only believe all this. The others that we track, such asTownsend-Greenspan, DRI, and Harris--your alma mater is forecastingeven lower rates, as you must know--and Chase all are giving forecastsvery similar to what the staff has. So, that kind of alternativemakes one feel better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with Steve, Jim, and others and stating that the forecasts from other sources are similar to the staff's forecasts.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 185.
 I think it would be beautiful if it comestrue, but--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It could just be that everybody iswrong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "but-- It could just be that everybody is wrong" indicates that the speaker is skeptical or disagrees with the idea mentioned before.


Passage number 186.
MR. FORD. That's what worries me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Ford, expresses his worry, which indicates personal concern or anxiety, but there is no clear indication of disagreement or contention with anyone else.


Passage number 187.
MR. ROBERTS. But so far the consensus is better than theindividual forecasts; that's been the experience of this guy out inArizona.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It mentions that the consensus is better than individual forecasts, based on the experience of someone in Arizona.


Passage number 188.
MR. RICE. But isn't it true that the majority of outsideforecasters expect higher interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple question asking for confirmation or clarification.


Passage number 189.
MR. FORD. No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Ford is simply responding with a short answer.


Passage number 190.
MR. RICE. Don't they expect higher long-term rates in 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple question asking about an expectation for higher long-term rates in 1984. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 191.
MR. FORD. Well, I just have the T-bill and the prime rates.All four of those outsiders expect, by the second quarter of 1984, theprime to be the same as it is this quarter on average and T-bill ratesto be maybe 1/2 percentage point or more lower. I don't know aboutbond rates; I didn't get that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the information Mr. Ford has regarding the T-bill and prime rates.


Passage number 192.
-17-8/23/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are there any other questions addressed toMr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a date and inquiring if there are any other questions addressed to Mr. Axilrod.


Passage number 193.
MR. PARTEE. Did I understand, Steve, that you wereexpressing the view that foreign demand for U.S. investments affectsU.S. interest rates rather than U.S. exchange rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage is presenting a question from Mr. Partee to Steve, seeking clarification on Steve's view. There is no evidence of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 194.
MR. AXILROD. I think they are probably not unrelated. I wasassuming that the large capital inflow we've had this time, without asharp depreciation in the dollar so far, reflected a willingness ofthe foreigners to put their money here not [wholly] independent ofinterest rates but more or less independent of interest rates--thatis, there is a wide range of interest rates that wouldn't havemattered. But that willingness really meant that the exchange ratestayed higher than it would otherwise be instead of depreciating.That kept our prices from being higher than they would otherwise beand it was the price effect in my mind that kept the interest ratesfrom being higher. It's somewhat like in the olden days of fixedexchange rates when we could run big balance of payments deficits andlose [foreign] exchange reserves and in some sense have biggerdomestic purchases without getting right away the inflationary impactof the purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 195.
 And in my head, subject to Ted's contradiction,something like that has been going on--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why wouldn't it have a direct effect oninterest rates as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 196.
MR. AXILROD. Well, yes. One would think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply agrees with the previous statement or question.


Passage number 197.
MR. PARTEE. I'd understood this as a circularity question.I'd really dismissed foreign demands ebbing and flowing as having aneffect on U.S. interest rates because of the circularity of flow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is simply expressing his understanding that foreign demands ebbing and flowing do not have an effect on U.S. interest rates due to the circularity of flow. He does not indicate any disagreement or contention with others.


Passage number 198.
MR. TRUMAN. It depends a bit on what you--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It only mentions Mr. Truman's response without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 199.
 You get thesame results as Steve's--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There isn't circularity when you'rerunning great big current account deficits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states a fact about getting the same results as Steve's and mentions that there is no circularity when running great big current account deficits.


Passage number 200.
MR. GRAMLEY. If you think [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 201.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That may be caused by the exchange rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that something may be caused by the exchange rate without expressing any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 202.
MR. TRUMAN. It's a question of how you break into thecircle. If you think the current account deficit to some extent hasbeen pushed by fiscal policy or an increase in aggregate demand in theUnited States, then to the extent that you can open as opposed to notbeing able to open up a current account deficit, in effect the savingthat comes in does damp the rise in interest rates that a givenimpetus to domestic demands would give you in a closed economycontext. That's a slightly different way of putting the same pointthat Steve was making, though you obviously know, Mr. Chairman, thatone has to say where one is going to start the circle.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of a perspective on the relationship between the current account deficit and fiscal policy in the United States.


Passage number 203.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If there are no other questions, we'll goand have some doughnuts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 204.
[Coffee break]-18-8/23/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've had some differences of opinionexpressed about the business outlook. There are some indications of alittle slowing [in the recovery] from the pace to date. Differencesof opinion on the outlook seem to be rooted in [unintelligible].There are some tentative signs of a little slowing in Ml; M2 and M3are doing pretty well in terms of the objectives. It doesn'tnecessarily strike me as a time for pronounced moves, but I'm open tocomments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the phrase "We've had some differences of opinion expressed about the business outlook." This indicates that there are differing views on the current business outlook.


Passage number 205.
MR. PARTEE. Let's vote on alternative B and go home.SEVERAL. I'll second that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Partee and several other individuals are expressing agreement and support for alternative B.


Passage number 206.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, I'd like to suggest that alternative Cwould be no change. We agreed last time that we wanted 7 percentgrowth in Ml and alternative C would take us there. I think theeconomy is doing great and we shouldn't change what we're doing, whichis working. And I would recommend that we go to alternative C.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing his opinion and suggesting a course of action, but there is no obvious contention or disagreement with others in the passage.


Passage number 207.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I don't think we have to arguereally about whether it's "B" or "C." We maintain the sameoperational paragraph and simply say we maintain the existing degreeof reserve restraint. And we assume [borrowing of] $700 to $900million. I guess that's the difference between us. If we go all theway down to alternative C, that assumes a borrowing range as high as$1 to $1-1/4 billion, and then we would be pushing up the federalfunds rate to 9-3/4 percent plus, whereas if we stick with $700 to$900 million, then it's about 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply discussing two different options and explaining the potential implications of each option.


Passage number 208.
MR. PARTEE. You're objecting to the Ml number, isn't thatright. You would rather have the old Ml range. That's all he'stalking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee is simply clarifying that the person he is speaking to is objecting to the Ml number and would prefer the old Ml range.


Passage number 209.
MR. MORRIS. I would remind you, Ted, that we're nottargeting Ml; we're only monitoring it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply reminding Ted about the purpose of their actions, clarifying that they are only monitoring M1, not targeting it.


Passage number 210.
MR. ROBERTS. It seems we could use our monitoring a littlemore sensitively, though, which I'd appreciate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Roberts suggests using monitoring more sensitively, indicating he would appreciate it.


Passage number 211.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The operational paragraph says 8-1/2and 8 percent for M2 and M3 and it says 7 percent for Ml. I don't seethat we have to change any language, but I feel very strongly that wenot go higher than $700 to $900 million on the initial borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show contention or disagreement. The speaker is stating the current percentages for M2, M3, and M1, and then expressing their personal opinion about the initial borrowing amount.


Passage number 212.
MR. GUFFEY. I would agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, agrees with a statement or point made. The passage does not mention any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 213.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, I don't know what the right level is.You remember the discussion the last time; we were so panicked overgoing to $400 million and nothing dreadful seemed to have [happened]in the market when we went to $900 million. In fact, the rates havesubsided here. I'd let the borrowing go up if necessary to maintainthe path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about what the right level of borrowing is and reflecting on previous discussions about panic over borrowing levels. The speaker also mentions that the rates have subsided, indicating a positive outcome. The statement about letting borrowing go up if necessary to maintain the path suggests a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances, rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 214.
MR. PARTEE. Well, the rates did go up a half point, Ted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the rates increased by a half point.


Passage number 215.
MS. TEETERS. Including long-term rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any sort of disagreement or contention. It only provides a statement or topic of discussion related to long-term rates.


Passage number 216.
-19-8/23/83MR. MORRIS. Net, I don't think it's a half point except forthe prime rate and the funds rate; the bill rate went up 25 basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses numbers and rates.


Passage number 217.
MR. WALLICH. This isn't the time, really, to make a change.Two weeks ago, I must say, I would have thought we should tighten up alittle, but the data that have come in have made me think we'd betterwait--as Steve said in his final remarks, wait and be cautious. Itlooks almost too good to be true that we can get off this bulge of Mlwith no further increase in interest rates. And, if true, it makes methink that something is happening to M1 in that it fails to send us avery useful message. But both from the point of view of the monetaryaggregates and the point of view of the economy, the right thing to meseems to be to go with "B," leave things as they are, and hope that[the forecast] as projected here is true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, agrees with Steve's suggestion to wait and be cautious. He believes that the current data suggests that they should leave things as they are and hope that the projected forecast is true.


Passage number 218.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think that's reinforced by the factthat we're getting credit--I'm not sure we deserve it--in that there'sa widespread perception in the financial community that it was ourtightening that started correcting that bulge. Whether it's true ornot true, we're getting the credit for it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing a perception in the financial community and acknowledges uncertainty about deserving the credit.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 219.
MR. PARTEE. We deserve anything we can get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a potential for disagreement in the passage. The statement "We deserve anything we can get" might lead to differing opinions as it can be interpreted as promoting entitlement or suggesting that individuals should receive whatever they desire without merit or effort. Some may disagree and believe that rewards should be based on deserving criteria rather than entitlement.


Passage number 220.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think Henry is probably right and that thingsaren't really as nice as they seem, but I'd just like to relax andenjoy it awhile.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, agrees with Henry's perspective but expresses a desire to simply enjoy the current situation.


Passage number 221.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know whether these viewsthat are expressed are the consensus, but I have a certain aversion tomaking unnecessary changes in these targets in the middle of thequarter. That appears to be an extreme fine-tuning. All we reallyhave to do, if this is the course we want to go, is say "The Committeeseeks in the short run to maintain the existing degree of reserverestraint." We'll discuss how that gets interpreted. Maybe we saythat the action is expected to be associated with growth in M2 and M3at around 8 percent--that's about what we have--and leave in the 7percent for Ml.MESSRS. GUFFEY, FORD, and CORRIGAN. Yes. Let's go home.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 222.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have to discuss just preciselywhat we mean by the borrowing assumption. As Steve suggested, allthings considered, the $700 to $900 million might be appropriate. Itis $100 million higher than we set before, but it encompasses therange that we've actually had.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speakers are discussing the borrowing assumption and the range of $700 to $900 million that they consider appropriate. While there is a slight difference in the amount previously set and the current range, it is not portrayed as a point of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 223.
MR. PARTEE. It's $100 million higher. Is that because youthink that the demand for borrowing is a little higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement followed by a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 224.
MR. AXILROD. It has been running, generally, quite a lothigher. This week it's running over $1 billion; even taking out acouple of what I think are special cases it would be running $800 to$900 million. And the federal funds rate is at 9-1/2 percent. Itseems that the demand for borrowing is running a little higher than wethought.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating information about the current running of the market and the demand for borrowing.


Passage number 225.
MR. WALLICH. Would that be matched by higher excess reservesthan usual.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of fact or inquiry.


Passage number 226.
-20-8/23/83MR. AXILROD. I was looking at the $350 million; I was notnecessarily assuming that, Governor Wallich. I assumed that the rangewould encompass some variation in excess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Axilrod was looking at $350 million and mentions his assumption about the range encompassing some variation in excess reserves.


Passage number 227.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we're still talking specificallyof excess reserves in the $350 to perhaps $400 million area when wemake that borrowing assumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating their belief about the range of excess reserves and is not presenting any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 228.
MS. TEETERS. Well, they've been running $650 million in thelast two weeks on the chart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the amount of money that has been spent over the past two weeks without presenting any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 229.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What--excess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question asking for clarification or explanation about excess reserves.


Passage number 230.
MS. TEETERS. No, the net borrowing ran about $650 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the net borrowing amount without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 231.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This would imply [excess reserves of] $350to $550 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating a range of values for excess reserves.


Passage number 232.
MR. BOEHNE. What set of numbers would keep the funds ratemore or less around 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about what set of numbers would maintain the funds rate around 9-1/2 percent.


Passage number 233.
MR. AXILROD. I would say somewhere between $700 and $900million on borrowing, but one can't be absolutely certain. Mr.Sternlight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Axilrod provides an estimate for borrowing, acknowledging that there is uncertainty but not engaging in any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 234.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I agree with that. And I agree with somelooseness of that relationship, because we seem to be gettingborrowing a little over $1 billion and yet the funds rate looks as ifit's going to average a little under 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the idea presented about the looseness of the relationship. They also mention the borrowing and the funds rate but there is no indication of disagreement or contention on those points.


Passage number 235.
 When I look backat some rough equations I tried to draw up, $700 to $900 million mightsuggest to me 9-1/2 percent or a little higher on average, but it--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where the funds rate is in the short run,I suspect, is partly affected by whether the market thinks interestrates are going to go up or down. If they think they're going up, thefunds rate will be higher; if they think they're going down, the fundsrate will be lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the possible factors that could affect the funds rate based on the market's perception of future interest rate movements.


Passage number 236.
MR. BOEHNE. Borrowing of $700 to $900 million seems like areasonable starting point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. The speaker simply expresses their opinion that borrowing $700 to $900 million is a reasonable starting point.


Passage number 237.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Also, we have a fairly long time beforethe next meeting. I thought we ought to have some sort of aconsultation in between.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating a suggestion to have a consultation before the next meeting.


Passage number 238.
MR. BOEHNE. It's October 4th, I think. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply stating the date, there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 239.
MR. PARTEE. I think it's an ordinary six-week interval.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee is expressing his opinion about the length of the interval, but there is no opposing viewpoint or contradictory statement provided.


Passage number 240.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have the question of the federal fundsrate range. We left it at 6 to 10 percent last time and I don't knowif there's any great reason to change it. I think its only relevancewill be when it is published.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is informing that there is a question about the federal funds rate range but does not express any disagreement or alternate viewpoint.


Passage number 241.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'd leave it alone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given statement 'I'd leave it alone'. The speaker expresses their opinion or preference to not intervene or take any action regarding a certain topic or situation. However, without more context, it is not possible to determine if there is any disagreement or contention between multiple parties.


Passage number 242.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't want to conclude thediscussion prematurely.-21-8/23/83SPEAKER(.). That's a blessing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their desire to not conclude the discussion prematurely, which is seen as a positive thing (indicated by "That's a blessing").


Passage number 243.
MR. BALLES. I'll start an argument here, just so that we canhave something to do between now and lunch time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that someone wants to start an argument for entertainment purposes.


Passage number 244.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have some other things we can talkabout, though. I don't want to encourage it unnecessarily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any conflicting opinions or argue against a particular point of view. The speaker simply suggests there are other topics available for discussion but prefers not to encourage them unless necessary.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 245.
MR. BALLES. Based on the San Francisco money market model,we do not share the view that Ml is in the process of slowing down.Therefore, that leads me to wonder whether the 10 percent funds rateis going to be enough to contain Ml anywhere near the path that wehave set for this quarter. We've already overshot as it is and Iwould expect some further overshoot based on our analysis. That leadsme in the direction of at least "B-" if not all the way to "C.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Balles, disagrees with the view that M1 is slowing down and expresses concern that a 10 percent funds rate may not be sufficient to contain M1. He also suggests that there will be further overshoot based on their analysis. This suggests disagreement or differing perspectives on the effectiveness of the current approach.


Passage number 246.
"VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But how can you get that significanta move upward for it to go over 10 percent if we're running policy aswe are and interpreting it as maintaining the existing degree ofreserve restraint. That's the operative sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing confusion about how to achieve a significant upward move if they continue to interpret and implement policy in the same way.


Passage number 247.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if the aggregates ran high, we couldtighten up on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses the possibility of tightening up on something if the aggregates ran high.


Passage number 248.
MR. PARTEE. But our main aggregates are M2 and M3, which arewithin their ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that "our main aggregates are M2 and M3, which are within their ranges." This information is presented without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 249.
MR. BALLES. I guess I'm quarreling about whether "existingdegree of reserve restraint" is in fact what we need or whether weneed a bit more restraint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they are questioning or debating whether "existing degree of reserve restraint" is sufficient or if a bit more restraint is needed.


Passage number 250.
MS. HORN. It comes down in part to whether we trustourselves to deal with the problem you raise when it happens, doesn'tit, John.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a potential factor to consider when dealing with a problem.


Passage number 251.
MR. BALLES. That's right. We have two choices: We can putour confidence in the forecast, which may be wrong, or wait to seewhat happens, in which case it may be too late.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Balles is simply presenting two options and discussing the potential outcomes of each.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 252.
MR. PARTEE. Well, since you're the one who has that forecast--Steve doesn't have the same forecast--it's putting our trust in yourforecast as against Steve's forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating that there is a difference in forecasts between someone (the person being addressed) and Steve, and implying that they need to decide whose forecast to trust.


Passage number 253.
MR. AXILROD. That was one of the two models I referred tothat did run higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states a fact or information without indicating any disagreement or contradiction.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 254.
MR. GUFFEY. I would just change the focus a little. Itisn't clear to me what establishment of a borrowing figure by thisCommittee really means. We've been operating on nonborrowed reservesor net borrowed reserves. It appears to me that what we're doing issimply pegging the funds rate at some level and turning over to theDesk and in a sense to you, Mr. Chairman, where that funds rate willrest on a week-to-week basis. I guess I'm raising a question on theoperational procedures that are being followed. If we're following aregime of merely pegging the funds rate, then establishing a borrowinglevel isn't very meaningful because it all cues off of what Peter andSteve believe will give us a 9-1/2 percent funds rate. And then it is-22-8/23/83adjusted from there depending on, I guess, their judgment and theChairman's judgment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Guffey is questioning the operational procedures being followed and the meaning and significance of establishing a borrowing figure. He suggests that the decision of the borrowing level is based on the judgment of Peter, Steve, and the Chairman, and questions how meaningful it is in the overall process.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 255.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, there is some variation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some variation. 

The word "some" suggests that there is a range or degree of variation, indicating that there may be differing views or perspectives on the topic being discussed. This suggests the presence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 256.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How much weight you put on the funds rateis in our minds when we make the decision. And we're obviouslyconstraining the funds rate in some sense but we're not aiming at aparticular funds rate. The funds rate came out a little higher--aquarter point maybe--than we anticipated at the last meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their thought process and the uncertainty surrounding the funds rate decision.


Passage number 257.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, to illustrate the point, the fact is thatthe funds rate ran up in the last two weeks; it then came back down,to be sure. It may have been affected by technical considerations ofthe [Treasury] refunding and other things. But as a member of thisCommittee, I have a very difficult time saying that $700 to $900million is the right borrowing figure when it is meaningless after thefirst day, if you will, after the paths are built. I'd rather talkabout some appropriate funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own perspective and difficulty in determining the right borrowing figure, but there is no disagreement with any other person or entity mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 258.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you can talk about what you want totalk about or what you want to aim at, but I don't think it'smeaningless after the first day. We haven't basically changed that.We could change it in light of all these factors mentioned here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 259.
MR. GUFFEY. When borrowing ran at the $900 to $1 billionlevel, we did not follow the regime of earlier days by adjusting thenonborrowed reserve path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It is stating a fact about the borrowing levels in the past and how they did not follow the same path as earlier days.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 260.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But in planning the nonborrowedreserve path you still have been using the assumption for everythingyou've said, haven't you, Peter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

The speaker is questioning Peter about his use of assumptions in planning the nonborrowed reserve path. This implies that there is disagreement or contention between the two parties.


Passage number 261.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. It only indicates that Mr. Sternlight responded affirmatively to something without specifying what the question or statement is.


Passage number 262.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Irrespective of the fact that someweeks borrowing comes in higher or lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present or discuss any conflicting viewpoints or opinions. It simply states a fact or observation without any disagreement.


Passage number 263.
MR. GUFFEY. [Unintelligible] and then you accommodate thatborrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, is likely discussing a topic related to borrowing and finding a solution or accommodation for it. However, the passage is insufficient to determine the exact context or the parties involved in the discussion.


Passage number 264.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, it looks to me as if we've had aconstructive effect. The policy has resulted in a path that hasslowed the [growth of the] monetary base, which is getting reflectedhere in a slowing in the stock of money.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Roberts is expressing his opinion that the policy has had a positive impact by slowing the growth of the monetary base and stock of money.


Passage number 265.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's a larger question. He'stalking about a narrower question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that a larger question is being discussed, while also acknowledging that the speaker is referring to a narrower question within that broader context.


Passage number 266.
MR. GUFFEY. Yes, I am.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement of agreement by Mr. Guffey.


Passage number 267.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm not on the phone every day, butmy understanding--if I'm wrong, Steve or Peter ought to speak up--isthat they are following the Committee's guidance in calculating thenonborrowed reserve path. They are not adjusting the nonborrowedreserve path to the actual borrowing that happened to occur in aparticular week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their understanding and inviting others to correct them if they are mistaken.


Passage number 268.
-23-8/23/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Except that, as kind of a footnote, theyhave had these weeks when [borrowing] came in very high early in theweek and the market may get pretty [unintelligible]. We get a lot ofexcess reserves as a result. The Desk hasn't been driven to supply alot of money to get the borrowings way down to balance off whathappened in the first half of the week on some occasions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a situation regarding borrowing and excess reserves.


Passage number 269.
MR. GUFFEY. But those weeks have followed one after theother; that is my point. It's not just one week in isolation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement of disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Guffey, emphasizing that the weeks have been consecutive.


Passage number 270.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, there were several weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there were several weeks


Passage number 271.
MR. STERNLIGHT. We got a lot of borrowing early in the week.There was one week when we were just about explicitly making the kindof adjustment that President Guffey referred to. We were prepared toaccommodate--to make some allowance for the high level of borrowing inthat week, as it closed out. We were going to make an allowance forhigh excess reserves as we were closing out the week but then itturned out that the reserve factors caused a big miss that pretty muchoffset the kind of allowance we thought we were making there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Sternlight, is simply describing a situation where they were planning to make an adjustment for high borrowing and excess reserves, but unexpected reserve factors caused their plans to be offset.


Passage number 272.
MR. PARTEE. Consider that confirmation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply introduces a statement or suggestion for consideration.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 273.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's clear that members of theCommittee, in varying degrees, have the level of the funds rate inmind when they think about the borrowing level. But we're notstrictly adjusting the operations so that we are aiming at aparticular federal funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a possible contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement mentions that members of the committee have the level of the funds rate in mind when considering borrowing levels, but they are not strictly adjusting operations to target a specific federal funds rate. This suggests a difference of opinion or approach within the committee regarding how closely they should align their operations with the funds rate.


Passage number 274.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, you try to hit a net borrowed reservefigure that will give you a [particular] funds rate, though, if Iunderstand the way you've been operating most recently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Guffey is simply seeking clarification or confirmation of the operating procedure.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 275.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is no clear statement of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 276.
 But that net borrowed reserve figurecomes out of the Committee's discussion on borrowing and--MR. PARTEE. I guess, though, that I can understand Roger'spoint. Another way to put it, precisely, is that you think $700 to$900 million is closer to giving us a 9-1/2 percent funds rate than$600 to $800 million was. So, Roger's point is: Well, why not justspecify a 9-1/2 percent funds rate and forget about the borrowingnumber. There's some logic to that, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a discussion and different perspectives on how to achieve a 9-1/2 percent funds rate.


Passage number 277.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can do that, but that's not what we aredoing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It acknowledges the possibility of doing something, but clarifies that it is not currently being done.


Passage number 278.
MR. WALLICH. It is true that we don't operate on theautomatic system where a rise in money supply and, therefore, demandfor reserves automatically leads to a rise in the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the operating system of the entity being discussed.


Passage number 279.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement "That is correct" implies agreement and acknowledgement of the information or statement that precedes it.


Passage number 280.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's why we changed the paragraphto put emphasis on the degree of tightening--or maintaining orloosening, even--of reserve restraint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 281.
MR. WALLICH. I think that is what Roger is saying, if Iunderstand him correctly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any clear statement of contention or disagreement. Mr. Wallich is summarizing Roger's point, indicating that he may have understood it correctly.


Passage number 282.
-24-8/23/83MR. GUFFEY. That's correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply acknowledging that the previous answer given is correct.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 283.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It certainly limits the amount ofvariability in the fed funds rate. There's no question about that.But I think it's also correct to say that we're not pegging it. We'veseen within a week a considerable movement in the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The author acknowledges that there is some limitation on the variability of the fed funds rate, but also argues that it is not being pegged. This suggests a disagreement or contention about the degree of control or influence on the rate.


Passage number 284.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With that clarification or lack thereof, Iguess where we are specifically is that we replace "increase slightlyfurther" with "maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint." Iwould just summarize that 8-1/2 and 8 percent by saying 8 percent [forboth M2 and M3] and take out the "respectively." We leave in the 7percent for M1 and I guess we're leaving in the 6 to 10 percent forthe federal funds range. And we are assuming a borrowing level of$700 to $900 million, unless these other factors suggest that thatshould be changed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 285.
MR. GUFFEY. And this implies a funds rate of around 9-1/2percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a factual statement without any disagreement or contention. It simply implies a specific funds rate of around 9-1/2 percent.


Passage number 286.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's where they are guessing, that'sright.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement or agreement of some sort.


Passage number 287.
MR. GUFFEY. Or a little less. [Laughter.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any specific sentence or clause related to an interest rate. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 290.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not true, is it. Mr. Bernard islooking at the last sentence of the boilerplate on interest rates."Interest rates rose appreciably through most of the intermeetingperiod but recently market rates have retraced much of their rise."We should just be putting in "all of their rise." Is that correct.SPEAKER(.). Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with Mr. Bernard's statement that the sentence should be modified to say "all of their rise" instead of "much of their rise."

MR. MARTIN. Some, but not all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
