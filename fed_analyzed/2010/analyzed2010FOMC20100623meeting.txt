Passage number 1.
 Frost, Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkTranscript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on June 22–23, 2010 June 22—Afternoon Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Let me update you on our Board nominees.  With some luck, we expect to have hearings before the Senate Banking Committee in the next three weeks or so.  And with some skill and luck, we might have our additional members here for the August meeting.  However, because we remain without reinforcements—[laughter]—I took the liberty of asking Governor Kohn to hang around for another meeting, and he very kindly agreed.  That will not stop us from honoring you tomorrow at lunch, but we appreciate your willingness to stay on for a bit longer. As usual, this is a joint Board–FOMC meeting, so I need a motion to close the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply provides updates and expresses gratitude.


Passage number 2.
  MR. KOHN.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "So moved" indicates agreement and support for the motion, rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 3.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  The first item is our briefing on financial developments, open market operations, and System facilities.  Brian, you have a lot of work to do today.  Let me turn to you first for open market developments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that there will be a briefing on financial developments and then asks Brian to provide information on open market developments.


Passage number 4.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Brian, either on market developments or on these two operational issues—the coupon swap or the draining tools.  Any questions for Brian.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if there are any questions for Brian on market developments or operational issues.


Passage number 5.
 MR. HOENIG.  You mentioned in your comments, Brian, the possibility of selling MBS and indicated that this coupon swap might be a better alternative.  Given the demand there is for MBSs, and the lack of supply, do you think selling our MBSs would be disruptive to the market.  Or, with the right explanation, would it be helpful to the market.  My own view is that it might be helpful, given some of the conversations that I have been in with bankers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing a topic and seeking opinions.


Passage number 6.
 MR. SACK.  Strictly in terms of market functioning, I think selling a small amount of MBS would be helpful.  As I mentioned in the briefing, it’s the sell leg of the coupon swap that alleviates some of the pressures that we see in the market.  Of course, the decision of whether we want to enter into a regime of selling assets doesn’t depend just on the market functioning, but it also depends on how it would affect financial conditions.  Depending on the size of that approach, the risk is that it could lead to a rise in long-term interest rates.  But in terms of a pure market functioning perspective, the market is very tight right now, and some more supply, particularly of these higher coupon securities, would probably be helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker suggests that selling a small amount of MBS would be helpful for market functioning and alleviating pressure. They also acknowledge the potential risks and considerations in terms of financial conditions and long-term interest rates. Overall, the passage presents a balanced perspective without any conflict.


Passage number 7.
 MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the reason I ask is that I’ve had some—not many, but some—bankers of the $10 billion size saying, “We can’t get these.  These are things we would like.  Why don’t you sell some of them.” And I thought it was a very fair question to ask us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement made by Mr. Hoenig and mentions that some bankers have expressed a desire for certain things.


Passage number 8.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply starts with an acknowledgement or agreement by saying "Okay" and then mentions the position of Vice Chairman.


Passage number 9.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I want to follow up on that point, and then I have another set of questions.  We could potentially alleviate the supply issues by doing other swaps if we wanted to, as opposed to actually selling assets outright, right.  We have other 5.5 percent coupons in our portfolio, so, in principle, if we wanted to address the market functioning, we could think about doing other swaps.  Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement that presents a suggestion or possibility for addressing supply issues.


Passage number 10.
 MR. SACK.  That’s correct.  The proposal here is only to do the coupon swaps for the $9 billion of unsettled transactions.  There is a broader question about whether there could be some swap program that would be broader to address market function.  I think your point is right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the previous statement and acknowledges the broader question but agrees with the point made by the other person.


Passage number 11.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So, on the market function issue, that might be worth evaluating, in order to see if it’s a good idea or not. The second thing I wanted to ask is about reserve-draining tools.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their thoughts and simply suggesting the evaluation of a potential idea and asking a question.


Passage number 12.
 MR. HOENIG.  May I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 13.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No - The word "sure" typically indicates agreement or certainty, rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 14.
  MR. HOENIG.  But part of my goal would be to shrink our balance sheet as well, without disrupting the market.  So I don’t want to get confused in terms of where my objective is relative to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their goal of shrinking the balance sheet without causing any disruptions in the market.


Passage number 15.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I understand.  The question I want to ask is on the reserve-draining tools.  As I see it, we have four of them, right.  We can run off maturing assets, we can do asset sales, we can do term deposit accounts, we can do reverse repos.  My question is:  Have we really evaluated what our preferences are among those four things.  Do we pull each lever equally, or do we prefer one lever over another.A related issue is:  How do we think about our preferences in terms of the cost.  Presumably the costs of all of these things are not going to be quite the same—either the interest expense that we’re paying to borrow the money or the forgone interest in letting the maturities run off.  Has the staff started to do any work on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply discussing different options and considerations related to reserve-draining tools.


Passage number 16.
 MR. SACK.  Well, certainly, a distinction has been drawn between selling assets or letting the balance sheet run down on the one hand, and using the reserve-draining tools on the other.  I think the staff has pointed out that the former tools, including asset sales, have additional effects, because they put duration back out into the markets and presumably put upward pressure on long-term interest rates.  In contrast, the draining tools don’t do that—they simply get reserves out and improve our control of short-term interest rates.  I think that distinction has been made pretty clearly in the staff memos.  We haven’t gone a further step and asked the question about which draining tools would be more costly, for example, comparing term deposits and reverse repos.  I think it’s hard to judge right now which one might be more costly, but it’s something we can certainly continue to think about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating their understanding of the distinction between different tools and expressing the need for further analysis.


Passage number 17.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I presume that, once you do the test, you’ll get some evidence about where the market wants to clear, at least for small quantities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement expresses a presumption or assumption about the outcome of a test, without any opinion or conflicting viewpoint being presented.


Passage number 18.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not include any statements or indications of contention or disagreement. It simply states "Mr. Sack" without any further information or context.


Passage number 19.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But you still won’t know exactly what the supply curve is for bigger quantities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not expressing any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating that even with more information, the exact supply curve for larger quantities is still unknown.


Passage number 20.
 MR. SACK.  Right.  And, of course, there’s always the possibility of having a very dynamic strategy and making adjustments over time, because we certainly will learn a lot about the effects of the tools as we start to use them in greater size.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the possibility of having a dynamic strategy and making adjustments over time based on the effects of using certain tools in greater size.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 21.
VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  I just want to suggest that the cost should be one of the parameters, because there is an effect on the taxpayer in terms of how we do this, namely, what the net amount of money that we rebate to the Treasury is.  So I think that should be one of the criteria, though certainly not to the exclusion of all the other criteria.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the cost should be considered as one of the parameters for a decision, while acknowledging that it shouldn't be the only criteria. This implies that there might be differing opinions on whether cost should hold more or less importance in the decision-making process.


Passage number 22.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only includes a statement without any conflicting viewpoints or opposing opinions.


Passage number 23.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to come back to President Hoenig’s point.  I’m a little uncomfortable with the idea of swaps on the FNMA 5.5s.  I’m intrigued by the idea of actually making outright sales, assuming the market would accommodate them without backing up significantly.  We bought them for a purpose; the purpose was achieved; your own charts show the accomplishment that took place in terms of their present levels.  But your chart 17 on MBS fails tell us there’s an imbalance in the marketplace.  I would imagine, although I’m guessing, that we probably would have a profit on these instruments.  I’m not sure. You also gave some other pretty compelling arguments:  the flight from risk that you noted—these are absolutely government-guaranteed securities, and, not unimportantly, the extension of expectations as to when we are going to tighten, which ought to provide any buyer of these securities, assuming they’re available at a decent price, some comfort that it will be some time before we tighten and might push up yields on the longer end.  My guess is, given what I used to do for a living, that sales would go well.  Let me give you an example of how things worked—it’s an exaggeration, but it illustrates the point.  We would go to a large group, Fidelity or anybody else, and say, “We’re willing to give you a portfolio, a very large one, of these mortgage-backed securities.”  They would have no trouble finding investors to take down these coupons as they now are, because otherwise their yield on cash is negligible.So, Mr. Chairman, I would like to suggest, if we’re going to talk about coupon swaps, that we broaden the discussion to talk about selling outright, and perhaps buying short-term Treasury bills.  The objective would be to affect our portfolio, assuming this could be done without sending a signal that we’re tightening monetary policy. We have experimented with demand deposits, with repos, and so on.  I’m wondering, Mr. Chairman, if there’s not a way we could do this and send a signal to the marketplace that this doesn’t have implications for monetary policy, but that we do have an imbalance in the marketplace, and we’re seeking to solve that imbalance, rather than getting into the business of swaps, which, I think, just prolongs the issue. So here’s my bottom-line question:  Would we consider outright sales, taking advantage of the fact that we will probably book a slight profit, take the proceeds, buy shorter-term Treasuries that help shorten the duration of the portfolio, and sell into a market that seems to be eager to buy this kind of paper.  That would be my question.  I suppose it’s a Committee question.  I’m not putting pressure on Brian, but Brian gave us a partial answer and indicated that there was a market appetite for these securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their discomfort with the idea of swaps on FNMA 5.5s and suggesting the possibility of outright sales instead. They provide reasons and arguments to support their suggestion and ask a question about considering outright sales.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 24.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, your conditional clause there was very important, that we would have to do this in a way that didn’t signal broader monetary tightening, and our ability to do that is at least debatable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that the ability to carry out the conditional clause without signaling broader monetary tightening is debatable, which implies differing opinions or opposing arguments exist regarding this matter.


Passage number 25.
 MR. FISHER.  Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states "exactly" in response to something that was said.


Passage number 26.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We can certainly debate it.  After the next round, where Brian is going to talk about redemptions, we have an open discussion period, and at that time we could talk about the broader policy issue, if you would like.  Let me suggest that, at this point, we consider the Desk’s proposals—assuming for the moment that we don’t go into a broaderselling regime—with the understanding that, if we were to begin to sell, that would then dominate these kinds of strategies.  So let’s assume for the purpose of this discussion that we’re not going to be selling, but then we can discuss that broader policy issue—it’s really not a technical issue; it is a broader policy issue—in the discussion period in just a few minutes.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily discussing the process of debate and the suggestion to consider certain proposals.


Passage number 27.
 MR. FISHER.  As long as it doesn’t preclude our having that discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker simply expresses their willingness to have a discussion without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 28.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Absolutely not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 29.
 MR. FISHER.  I think that’s totally fair.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher expresses agreement with the Chairman's statement.


Passage number 30.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Any other questions for Brian.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if there are any additional questions for Brian. The mention of President Lacker does not indicate any conflict or disagreement either.


Passage number 31.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In chart 17, the MBS fails, there’s a pretty big number, $700 or $800 billion.  How much of that is in the 5.5 coupons.  Actually, I don’t care how much is in the 5.5s.  How much is in the 4.5s.  Are there fails in the 4.5s now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and specific information about the amount of fails in different mortgage-backed securities (MBS).


Passage number 32.
 MR. SACK.  We don’t have complete data on the distribution of fails across coupons.  We believe that more than half the fails are in the 5s and the 5.5s.  I highlighted the 5.5s.  There are fails as well in the 5s.  And there are fails across the coupon stack.  But it’s certainly concentrated in higher coupons.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they do not have complete data on the distribution of fails across coupons and gives their belief that more than half of the fails are in the 5s and the 5.5s. They also mention that there are fails in the 5s and across the coupon stack, but it is concentrated in higher coupons. This is all presented as information and there is no disagreement or conflicting viewpoints expressed.


Passage number 33.
 MR. LACKER.  But there are fails in the 4.5s, you suspect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact or observation made by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 34.
 MR. SACK.  I think there are, but they’re much more limited, and we are, as I said in the briefing, much less worried about delivery of the 4.5s, and even the 5s, because there is still production in those coupons.  Actually, there are other market dynamics that are somewhat complicated that are increasing the supply of deliverable securities into the TBA market.  Some of the older vintages of those coupons are cheapening up enough to come into the TBA market. So, as I said, we’re particularly worried about the 5.5s, and much less worried about the 5s, and much, much less worried about the 4.5s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement about the speaker's opinions regarding the delivery of certain coupons in the TBA (to-be-announced) market.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 35.
 MR. LACKER.  In our purchase agreement, if our counterparty is failing to us, what obligation do we have.  Can we cancel it.  Can we unwind it.  Can we renege.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the following passage. Mr. Lacker is asking a series of questions regarding the purchase agreement's provisions in case the counterparty fails to fulfill their obligations. The use of terms like "cancel," "unwind," and "renege" suggests a potential disagreement or contention between the involved parties on how to handle such a situation.


Passage number 36.
 MR. SACK.  We can do any of those things.  The question is:  What obligation do they have.  They owe us the security and aren’t delivering it.  They have an obligation to deliver.  There’s an ability to fail, essentially without penalty now, because the short-term interest rates are close to zero.  And after several months, we have the right to initiate buy-in procedures, which would essentially force a negotiation with the counterparty for terms at which the transaction would be canceled. Our view is that going down the road of forcing delivery, whether just through communications with the primary dealers or eventually through initiating buy-in procedures, would be even more disruptive to market functioning.  We’re seeing all of these pressures in the market right now under a strategy where we’re allowing the counterparties to fail and where we’re actually doing dollar rolls to postpone their settlement.  So our view is that, if we turned around and forced delivery of that final $9 billion, it would tighten that coupon significantly and be very disruptive to the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the potential consequences and potential disruptions to the market if they were to force the delivery of the $9 billion.


Passage number 37.
 MR. LACKER.  You described the transaction as a sale. To some extent, it’s just like saying you have an option, and you engage in the opposite option, and that cancels the first option contract—right.—and any sort of forward thing.  You could use the word “unwind” for that, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 38.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions Mr. Sack without providing any context or presenting any conflicting opinions or ideas.


Passage number 39.
MR. LACKER.  So you could describe it any way we want.  We could say we dumped $9 billion on the market, or we could say we’ve unwound a transaction that had failed.  And you could describe it in sort of antiseptic terms, couldn’t you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement that discusses different ways of describing a transaction.


Passage number 40.
 MR. SACK.  That’s right.  Whether we sell outright or do the coupon swap, what we’re doing is we’re unwinding that transaction, but we’re doing it at market prices, as opposed to the other procedures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining a process and the different options available, without expressing any disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 41.
 MR. LACKER.  Forcing through, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about someone or something forcing through.


Passage number 42.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. It only mentions someone named Mr. Sack.


Passage number 43.
 MR. LACKER.  Do you really think that if we said we were doing this one time because of the fails, then markets would believe we were sneakily taking the first step down the road to an asset sales program.  You really don’t think we can convey to markets that this is a one-time deal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is posing a question to someone, seeking their opinion on whether the market would believe the Federal Reserve's explanation for a one-time action.


Passage number 44.
 MR. SACK.  I think you probably could effectively communicate that.  We just thought the coupon swap was a simple, elegant solution to it, because it’s a common transaction in the market, and because it provides 100 percent clarity that the Fed is not starting a sales regime.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of one person's opinion on a particular topic.


Passage number 45.
 MR. LACKER.  But, to some extent, you’re just shifting the problem to the 4.5s, where the problem isn’t as strong.  But, on net, there are all of these fails in MBS.  Ironically we entered this market to improve functioning of financial markets, and now we seem to be a force for bad in this market rather than a force for good.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 46.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s important to understand that fails can occur for two reasons.  One is a shortage of security.  The other is because the interest rate is so low and there’s no penalty for not delivering.  In the Treasury market, of course, there are penalties for not delivering, and there are essentially no fails in that market.  There is under way, I understand—   Brian, you can correct me—a process now to have an analogous penalty in the MBS market.  Presumably, at least for the 4.5s, that must be the principal source of the fails.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the principal source of fails in the MBS market is the lack of penalties for not delivering, while someone named Brian may correct them by stating that there is a process in place to implement penalties similar to the Treasury market.


Passage number 47.
 MR. SACK.  Right.  That effort is under way.  It is a complicated issue that the Treasury Market Practices Group is studying.  But let me make one point clear:  Market conditions in the 5.5s are extremely different from those in the 4.5s or the 4s—extremely different.  So we think it’s highly unlikely that we would do the coupon swap and then find ourselves in such a difficult situation with the new coupon we enter into.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and stating their opinion about the likelihood of a difficult situation arising after a coupon swap.


Passage number 48.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there are other questions, without offering any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 49.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Shifting to the time deposit trial, do you have a sense, when we really do this at scale, of what will happen to the rate that clears the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking if the speaker has an understanding of what will happen to the market rate when the time deposit trial is implemented on a larger scale.


Passage number 50.
 MR. SACK.  I would say that we don’t have a strong sense.  There are reasons to think that the capacity of the facility should be pretty high at relatively low rates.  As mentioned, the institutions that have signed up for the TDF hold a large amount of excess reserves currently—over $500 billion.  They’re holding those earning, obviously, the interest rate on excess reserves, so we think that’s a situation that will lead to significant demand—that is, they’re able to pick up some yield by entering into the term deposits.  But I don’t have a more precise answer than that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they do not have a precise answer to the question.


Passage number 51.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only states the name and title of President Plosser without indicating any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 52.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I’d just like to emphasize that I kind of agree with President Lacker and President Hoenig here.  I don’t see any reason why we cannot just unwind this position, sell our claims to these 5.5s to somebody else, and get out from it, and explain that given the short supply of these securities and the demands out there for them, that this is a technical operation.  I think we can do this without aggravating the situation or engendering the belief that this is the beginning of a more aggressive selling campaign.  Given the number of fails, $800 billion—Ithink I remember we’ve got about $9 billion in these securities, so it’s a relatively small volume here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is agreeing with President Lacker and President Hoenig and expressing his opinion on how to unwind the position and sell the claims without causing any harm or panic in the market.


Passage number 53.
 MR. SACK.  $9 billion that has not settled.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states a fact about the amount of money that has not settled, without expressing any opposing viewpoints or conflicting information.


Passage number 54.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, right. That’s what I meant, the $9 billion that hasn’t settled.  My understanding is that we’ve got an awful lot of the 5s and 5.5s on our balance sheet already.  So I would really be in favor of not doing the swaps but of unwinding the position and putting them back out in the market.  That’s my view.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is stating his opinion or view on a specific matter, but there is no indication of any disagreement or argument with someone else.


Passage number 55.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is there a way to cancel the transaction without loss, as opposed to having to go out and actually sell to a third party.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply asks whether there is a way to cancel a transaction without loss, contrasting it with the alternative of selling to a third party.


Passage number 56.
   MR. SACK.  Yes.  We can negotiate with the counterparties and cancel the transaction at a negotiated price.  We thought there was an advantage to doing what effectively cancels the transaction, but doing so at market prices.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 57.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  As an arm’s-length transaction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents an arm's-length transaction as a concept without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 58.
  MR. SACK.  Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement or indication of disagreement or contention. Mr. Sack simply responds with the word "exactly," which suggests agreement or confirmation.


Passage number 59.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Excuse me, I don’t quite understand.  There are two sides to that transaction.  You’re doing a swap to get rid of those 5.5s in exchange for the 4.5s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply expressing that he doesn't quite understand the transaction being discussed.


Passage number 60.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage mentions Mr. Sack, but does not suggest any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 61.
 MR. PLOSSER.  What we’re saying is, why don’t we just do one side of that transaction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is suggesting a specific course of action without any apparent opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 62.
 MR. SACK.  Yes.  I understand your point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sack expresses that he understands the speaker's point, which indicates agreement rather than disagreement.


Passage number 63.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I guess what I’m saying is:  Why isn’t there a market price for that as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by Mr. Plosser regarding the absence of a market price for something.


Passage number 64.
  MR. SACK.  Yes, I am sorry.  Whether you do it as a pure sale or a coupon swap, you are using market prices to essentially cancel the 5.5s, that’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging and confirming a statement made by someone else.


Passage number 65.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context about Governor Tarullo's stance or actions that could indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 66.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I understand Tom Hoenig’s position, which is very straightforward and consistent with what Tom has said before, namely, that he’d like to begin to reduce the size of the balance sheet.  That’s why, when presented with Brian’s issue, he responds accordingly.  But I’m, maybe not bemused, but a bit interested in, Charlie and Jeff, how you are parsing this.  On the one hand, you say, “Couldn’t we explain it in a purely technical fashion.”  On the other hand—this may be the equivalent of taking judicial notice—I’m aware of your views on asset sales as well.  So I’m wondering:  Aren’t you, in all honesty, sort of motivated by some of the same things that are motivating Tom.  And if that’s true, isn’t this saying, “Well, couldn’t we convince people that it’s really technical.” even though it may not be the sole motivation that we would have for doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo questions Charlie and Jeff's motivations for advocating for explaining the issue in a technical manner, suggesting that they may have similar motivations as Tom Hoenig, who wants to reduce the size of the balance sheet.


Passage number 67.
 MR. LACKER.  I’ll start.  It’s true.  I’ll admit it.  There’s this third option, but let’s focus on the choice between selling $9 billion and swapping $9 billion of 4.5s.  Let’s suppose we sell $9 billion, and then we decide whether to buy 4.5s.  At this point, I look at financial conditions, I look at the market, and I ask, “Why buy 4.5s.”  Would I like to start selling assets.  Sure.  But, to me, that’s separate, that’s not on the table today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contains any disagreement or contention. It is a statement giving an opinion on a possible option and discussing potential actions.


Passage number 68.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I’ll stand by his answer.  That’s a good one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser expresses agreement with the answer given.


Passage number 69.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions President Lockhart without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 70.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Just to clarify, if you think in terms of a general market observer:  If you do the swaps, the balance sheet stays the same; if you follow Jeff’s provision, the balance sheet shrinks.  And the interpretation of that is what we are debating, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact and mentioning that there is a debate about the interpretation of that fact.


Passage number 71.
 MR. SACK.  Correct.  I think the coupon swaps are a very simple technical adjustment.  It’s as if, along the way to buying $1¼ trillion of assets, we had just bought $9 billion less of the5.5s and bought $9 billion more of the 4.5s.  If we had done it along the way, I don’t think anyone would be sitting here talking about it.  Unfortunately, we got caught with the settlement problem.  But I think there’s a very simple, commonly used solution in the market, which is the coupon swaps.  Of course, we’re doing transactions already to facilitate settlement: We’re doing dollar rolls, where we’re willing to swap settlement across delivery days.  And this is just another variant of that, except that it gives us some range to swap across coupons.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply explaining a technical adjustment and suggesting a solution to a settlement problem.


Passage number 72.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I can see that this question is not as separable from the broader ones, as I had hoped.  We will have an opportunity discuss the broader issues in just a minute, if that’s okay.  Does anyone else have any questions for Brian on either this issue or the broader market concerns.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not include contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the interconnectedness of a question and the broader issues, and then asking for additional questions on the given topic.


Passage number 73.
 MR. FISHER.  Just for clarity here, in following up on President Lockhart’s question:  If we were to sell these and buy Treasury bills, we don’t shrink our balance sheet, is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply clarifies a question asked by President Lockhart and does not express any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 74.
  MR. SACK.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The response simply confirms the correctness of the statement.


Passage number 75.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a polite expression of gratitude and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 76.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The provided phrase, "President Kocherlakota," does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the title or position of an individual without any context or indication of conflict.


Passage number 77.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I’ll just say briefly now that in a few minutes I will speak in favor of selling in general.  But I think that’s a distinct policy decision we should contemplate and discuss.  Speaking for myself, I think this is a perfectly reasonable way to address this particular problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and suggesting a possible solution to a problem.


Passage number 78.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Anyone else.  [No response.]  As I said, we’ll come back to this issue.  We now turn to Brian Sack for a briefing on the Treasury redemption issue.  This was—like the first issue—also supported by a memo last week.  Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply mentions that there was no response from anyone and then states that they will come back to the issue later. It then transitions to a new topic, discussing Brian Sack and the Treasury redemption issue.


Passage number 79.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I think we’re going to end up having a go-round, so everyone is going to get a chance to give their views.  For the moment, let’s just restrict ourselves to questions for Brian.  Does anyone have questions.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges that there will be a discussion and invites questions for Brian.


Passage number 80.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Brian, I have a couple of questions about market effect in the last row of Table 3.  One is that I couldn’t understand why the effect under option 4 was twice as large as the effect under option 3.  And, relatedly, I guess, what’s the source of those estimates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they have some questions and seeking clarification or information.


Passage number 81.
 MR. SACK.  Let me start with the second question.  The source of the estimates is the same set of staff analysis that we’ve used in the past.  I think the staff has argued that the full asset-purchase program of $1.7 trillion would, perhaps, lower longer-term interest rates 50 to 80 basis points.  If we scale that down to $300 billion, which is the change discussed here, you’ll get something on the order of 10 to 15 basis points, which is actually the lower end of this range. As for the first question of why the effects are so much smaller under options 2 or 3, there’s implicit in that an assumption that the Treasury will be willing to shift more issuance to shorter-term securities given our participation there.  So, actually, the amount of duration that ends up being pushed into the market is greater under option 4 than under options 2 and 3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the source of the estimates and the rationale behind why the effects may be smaller under options 2 or 3 compared to option 4. There is no disagreement or debate presented in the passage.


Passage number 82.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Oh.  That’s what I couldn’t figure out, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a statement made by Mr. Kocherlakota expressing his confusion or inability to understand something.


Passage number 83.
MR. SACK.  Now, just to be clear, the Treasury I think has some concern about rollover risk even regarding our holdings.  It’s much less concern than with the public, but not zero concern.  So under any of these options, given that we’re holding less duration, there will be more duration pushed out into the markets.  At this time, Treasury is quite interested in extending its debt maturity for this particular reason.  So I think all of these options produce some upward pressure on long rates, but it’s more severe under option 4.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply explains the Treasury's concern about rollover risk and their interest in extending debt maturity.


Passage number 84.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement, "Thank you," demonstrates gratitude or appreciation, not contention or disagreement.


Passage number 85.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren, a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation:
The given passage doesn't contain enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. It merely states that President Rosengren has a question, but it doesn't provide any context or opposing viewpoints to suggest disagreement or contention.


Passage number 86.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes, a technical question.  It seemed that some of the options were based just on when things would be redeemed versus when an auction would occur so that you could put the funds back to work.  Once something matures, is there any problem with just doing repos until a Treasury bill auction occurs.  Is there something I don’t understand about the mechanics that would make it difficult to have a bridge between the maturity of a longer-term security and rolling into a Treasury bill auction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question seeking clarification on the mechanics of using repos as a bridge between the maturity of a longer-term security and rolling into a Treasury bill auction.


Passage number 87.
 MR. SACK.  The problem with that is that there’s a legal interpretation that we can only acquire securities at an auction when we have securities maturing that day.  We are required to obtain securities in the open market in general, but the interpretation has been that we can roll securities over when their maturity date matches the settlement date of a new issue.  The problem with your outcome is that, as soon as we start to do repos, we’ve lost the option to jump back into the new auction in the primary market.  We have explored other options—such as whether Treasury could issue a bridging security to us, and so on—but we’ve been able to come up with a solution that circumvents the problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining a problem and discussing potential solutions.


Passage number 88.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. "Thank you" is a polite and neutral response to the preceding statement.


Passage number 89.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage because the passage only mentions President Plosser without providing any context or information about specific opinions or viewpoints.


Passage number 90.
 MR. PLOSSER.  My question is related to that as well.  I was looking at options 2 and 3 and trying to figure something out.  From the memo, it looked as if the way you got the volume of bills that you held in 2 was driven exactly by the matching up of the auction dates, and that’s how you got to the mix of bills and lower coupons in 2 versus 3, or in 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply questioning the information in the memo and seeking clarification.


Passage number 91.
 MR. SACK.  That’s exactly right.  It may help to understand that there are three different settlement structures in play in the Treasury market.  There are Treasury bills, which settle every Thursday; and then there are the coupons, which are either on a mid-month cycle or an end-of-month cycle.  Given the restriction that we can roll securities over in the primary market only when the maturity of one security matches the issue date of the new security, we’re left constrained in terms of how we can reallocate across coupons. That’s actually one advantage of option 2—by including Treasury bills, two-year notes, and three-year notes, we cover that full range of settlement days, because the two-year notes settle at the end of the month, and the three-year notes settle mid-month.  So that’s a solution that allows us to be present on every single Treasury issuance day, while still achieving a shortening of the portfolio.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply explains different settlement structures in the Treasury market and discusses the advantages of option 2.


Passage number 92.
 MR. PLOSSER.  So, under option 2, the $68 billion of bills is likely to be the maximum amount of bills that you could purchase under that strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 


Passage number 93.
 MR. SACK.  That’s correct.  And just to be clear to everyone, in option 3, to go to a bills-only portfolio would, therefore, require sizable secondary market purchases of bills.  That could present communication difficulties, because with one hand, we’d be trying to pull reserves out of the system through term deposits and reverse repos, and with the other hand, we’d be making short-term investments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a fact about the potential communication difficulties that could arise from going to a bills-only portfolio. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 94.
MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is simply expressing gratitude for something.


Passage number 95.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is not providing any information or statements that can be disputed or disagreed upon. It simply mentions the title of the person being referred to as "President Evans" without presenting any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 96.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I think you implied that this will be a change in policy and it would be a surprise in financial markets.  Could you discuss a little bit more how markets have formed expectations regarding how we will deal with our Treasury holdings and that they will be rolled over.  I don’t believe we’ve really discussed this explicitly in our FOMC statements.  It’s an element of our policy decisions, and the discussion seems a bit incomplete relative to our previous decisions.  This is something that we’re going to be grappling with for some time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of a speaker (Mr. Evans) expressing his desire for further discussion and clarification on a particular policy decision.


Passage number 97.
 MR. SACK.  Right.  The past several sets of FOMC minutes have stated, I believe, that the Committee has discussed the reinvestment strategy and that the current reinvestment strategy will be continued, which suggests that it is a policy decision in play.  Yet the financial markets still see it as very unlikely to change it in the short term.  You can see from our dealer survey that over, say, a two-year horizon the chance of some type of Treasury redemptions actually moves up to about a third, but, in the short term, redemptions are seen as very unlikely.  I think there hasn’t been a broad enough discussion of the other options that we’re entertaining—options 2 and 3, where we reinvest in the shorter coupons—for market participants to have caught on and be considering that as a possible outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing different perspectives on the current reinvestment strategy and suggesting that there may be other options that have not been fully considered or understood by market participants.


Passage number 98.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Brian.  [No response]  I think the most efficient thing is to have a go-round and to have some discussion of both the sales issue and the redemptions issue.  I assume that, once we determine what we’re doing on those two, the question about the MBS swaps will kind of fall out of that.  We went through this at great length in the last meeting.  To try to minimize the repetition, I happen to have with me, by coincidence,the minutes, and I thought I could just remind you of what we agreed to when we voted on the minutes and what the public has heard from us. First of all, there were four principles on which we had essentially uniform agreement.  First, whatever strategy we adopt, we should be consistent with our objectives of maximum employment and price stability; in other words, we have to take into account the financial and economic conditions when we think about this.  Second, we are looking to normalize the balance sheet, both its size and composition, over time.  Third, doing number two would eventually entail sales of agency debt and MBS; in other words, we’re in agreement that we’re not going to go strictly through a redemptions strategy.  And, fourth, any sales would be communicated in advance, conducted at a gradual pace, and potentially adjusted in response to changes in economic and financial conditions.  So those are the four principles that I think we all agree on:  macro objectives, normalize the balance sheet, sell at some point, but do it in a way that’s gradual and well-communicated. The next portion of the minutes talked about areas where there was diversity of views.  I’ll quote: “Most participants favored deferring asset sales for some time.”  So, at this point, the market does not expect a near-term sale.  It doesn’t mean we can’t do it.  We also communicated that a majority preferred beginning asset sales some time after the first increase in the FOMC’s target for short-term interest rates.  That was option 2, you recall, when we looked at the various issues.  Again, it was a majority, not everyone.  The rationale given was that such an approach would postpone any asset sales until the economic recovery was well established and would maintain short-term interest rates as the Committee’s key monetary policy tool. Given the four conditions on which we agree, I think the question at hand is whether we should reverse the communication we’ve already made, namely, that assets sales would bedeferred for some time and that asset sales would come after interest rate moves, and communicate a different strategy that would involve at least announcing very soon what our schedule of asset sales would be. Let me make two additional points, if I could.  First, while I think it is important to discuss issues of market functioning and so on, I think we all should recognize that the key issue here is the signal that we give in terms of policy:  What is the market going to infer from the announcement that we make.  In particular, when we talked about sales in the scenarios that the staff did in the last meeting, we talked about situations, for example, where sales would be combined with a more extended period of low interest rates rather than a less extended period.  Can we do that communication.  I think that’s a very important issue. The second and final comment I’d like to make is sort of a request.  As we’ll discuss later on, it seems to me, at least, that the economic and financial outlook is somewhat weaker today than it was in April.  Therefore, if the Committee instructs me to undertake either a significant redemptions policy or a sales policy, I would ask you to allow me to use the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to provide additional warning and preparation for such a change, given what we’ve communicated—if, in fact, that’s what we decide to do.  But, of course, again, that’s your option.  With those background comments in the hope of trying to make this an efficient and effective discussion, why don’t we begin a go-round.  Before we do that, Matt reminds me that we need to vote to approve domestic open market operations.  If there are no objections to doing that—[no response] I see no objection.  Okay.  Who would like to go first.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the agreement on principles and the need for further discussion and decision-making.


Passage number 99.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I’ll try to be brief.  Let me just cut to the chase about what I’m thinking about this.  I think one of the things that we did learnlast time from the memos was that the process of sales in terms of its macroeconomic impact was going to be modest, particularly if the sales were gradual and at a measured pace. Consistent with those four principles, one of the things that we haven’t emphasized in our communication, though, is a pre-commitment to the mix of what the balance sheet looks like.  We’ve done something, but we haven’t committed to the observation that that mix is going to remain fixed over time.  In fact, it obviously is changing some because of our redemption policies on MBS.  When I look at these two proposals on the MBS swap, as President Lacker suggested, the MBS swap amounts to a sale of the 5.5s and a purchase of the 4.5s, in effect.  So that is a sale and it is a purchase, in effect.  I’m thinking, though, that maybe to help normalize our balance sheet in terms of the mix, selling the 5.5s and purchasing Treasuries would keep the balance sheet the same, but just says we’re buying Treasuries instead of buying MBS to replace those. That leads me to thinking about the Treasury redemption strategy, and I am comfortable with option 2.  I think that’s a sensible strategy and it’s consistent with our goal to normalize our balance sheet and get the maturity structure down.  My preference would be to have a little more shorter-term assets in the mix than what option 2 offers, but, given the constraints that we face for the foreseeable future, at least, maybe that’s not feasible, and trying to match what’s available in the marketplace would be best.  Because we haven’t made a commitment to the public or talked much about what the mix of the portfolio looks like, I think my preference is to forgo the opportunity to purchase extra MBS or purchase the 4.5s instead of the 5.5s, let the 5.5s go, take that resource and invest it in short-term Treasuries in line with option 2 of the staff’s memo.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser is expressing his thoughts and preferences on the topic at hand, but there is no indication of disagreement with anyone else or a debate taking place.


Passage number 100.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentions or disagreements. It simply expresses gratitude to President Rosengren.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 101.
MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the last meeting, a majority of us thought that sales should occur after tightening.  I don’t think we should be revisiting this at each meeting.  I think we should come to a conclusion and stand by it.  I think the reason that a majority of us thought that sales should go after a tightening is because sales are a tightening.  They may be of a small magnitude, but the direction is clear—it’s a tightening. The reason mortgage rates have fallen is not because the economy is so strong, it’s because the economy is weaker than it was before.  What was striking in Brian’s first memo was a 20 percent chance that somebody falls off the euro.  Well, I think the reason mortgage rates are so low is that the possibility of a tail event has gone up substantially, and that wasn’t the case at the previous meeting.  So I think it would be particularly puzzling right now—in this environment, with the inflation rate forecast lower, the unemployment rate forecast higher, the market as a whole thinking that interest rates are lower because a bad outcome is more likely, and the stock market down—if we said we’ve decided to do a tightening.  I find it quite inconsistent that we would do a tightening at this meeting, even if it is of a small magnitude.  So I don’t think that we should take back what we had agreed to and what we represented in the minutes at the last meeting. On the Treasuries, my preference spills over a little into our forecast discussion in the next two parts of the meeting, but I don’t think this is the time to make any changes at all.  My preference would be to make no change in what we’re doing for the Treasury portfolio.  Over time, I can see some logic in shortening the maturity, but I don’t think this is the time to do it.  If anything, the probability of having to do more purchases has gone up rather than down.  We’re closer to a deflationary scenario, and we’re closer to an environment in which we could have a really bad outcome, and we don’t have many tools to deal with a really bad outcome.  Interestrates are already bound by zero, so our only option is sales or purchases of other assets.  In that environment, this is a particularly good time not to do anything and see if we might actually have to do more purchases rather than more sales as time goes on.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Rosengren argues against tightening and suggests that the current economic conditions call for no changes or even additional purchases. He disagrees with the idea of doing a tightening at this meeting.


Passage number 102.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 103.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  The more I think about this, the harder it is for me to shake this idea that the size and the composition of our asset holdings are two distinct things that we can vary differently.  I’m struck by the extent to which, at the last meeting, some earlier meetings, and the discussion now, asset sales are viewed as synonymous with reducing the size of our asset holdings.  I read over the minutes of the last meeting.  Everyone who spoke against asset sales was speaking against reducing the size of our asset holdings.  No one opposing asset sales said anything about the composition of our balance sheet.  The minutes accurately reflect that a majority were in that camp.  I think it’s misleading—and I wish I had brought this up when we had a chance to edit the minutes—to refer to that as asset sales.  In fact, a majority favored not taking steps to reduce our asset holdings. We all want to normalize our balance sheet and return to Treasuries-only—it’s one of our principles.  It looks to me as if we can have both.  We have these four principles here.  There’s a Pareto improvement available to us, where we can normalize our balance sheet more rapidly without sacrificing anything on the other dimensions.  So I’d advocate selling.  We’re talking about taking the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and buying assets with them.  Not only is this the status quo, but we’re buying new assets as we go along.  I don’t see why we can’t embark on a program of selling mortgage-backed securities.  And if the majority of the Committee believes we shouldn’t reduce the size of our asset holdings until after the first interest rate increase, well, then, so be it—we’ll put the proceeds into short-term Treasuries.  As for the narrow question, Ifavor option 2, because I don’t want to reduce our Treasury holdings—we’re only going to increase them later as we roll off MBS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Lacker is disagreeing with the idea that asset sales are synonymous with reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's asset holdings. He argues that they can vary the size and composition of the holdings separately.


Passage number 104.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage doesn't present any information or statements that can be accepted or disputed, so there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 105.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, if we were to go in a particular direction, I would totally agree with giving you all the time you need to explain it in terms of the Humphrey-Hawkins.  I certainly understand that, and it needs to be explained.  The reason I raised the question is partly because we did say circumstances had changed, and I looked at it as an opportunity to reduce our balance sheet without necessarily disrupting the markets or our longer-run objectives, provided we give the right explanation.  I still feel that we can do that.  We’re already experimenting with term auction facilities to bring excess reserves down.  This is a favorable selling into a favorable market that would further allow us to reduce those holdings.  It seemed like a reasonable thing to do, in my opinion. In terms of what President Lacker was saying, if we have that opportunity and the goal is not to shrink the balance sheet, I would just as soon put shorter-term Treasuries on as other mortgage-backed securities.  So that’s where I am.  On the narrow question, I suppose I could go with option 2 as well, so we would move towards Treasuries.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage reflects a discussion between Mr. Hoenig and President Lacker. There is no clear contention or disagreement between them. Mr. Hoenig expresses his agreement with giving more time to explain a particular direction, while also offering his opinion on reducing the balance sheet. He also mentions his preference for investing in shorter-term Treasuries rather than other mortgage-backed securities. President Lacker's views are not explicitly mentioned, so it is difficult to determine if there is any disagreement.


Passage number 106.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude towards Governor Kohn.


Passage number 107.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see, President Lacker, selling mortgage-backed securities and buying short-term Treasury securities as a tightening action—we would be putting more duration in the market and reducing the duration on our balance sheet.  I agree that we want to go there at some point, and the question I think that’s confronting us is at what point.  Compared with you, perhaps, I put less emphasis on the total level of the balance sheet.  I don’t think all of those excess reserves are having much of an effect on economic activity, bank credit,or anything else, and I put much more emphasis on the composition of the balance sheet.  So I would be somewhat hesitant at this point to take what I would see as even a slight tightening action. Let me go through the various options.  On MBS sales, I’m where I was last time and where the majority of the Committee was last time.  Selling MBS or even exchanging them for Treasury bills would be a tightening action.  I would like to keep the Committee’s attention and the public’s attention on short-term interest rates as the most active and the least confusing instrument we have for affecting monetary policy.  I think the communication challenges of doing what you suggested, or just selling MBS outright as President Hoenig suggested, without triggering an expectation that this was the first step in tightening would be very, very considerable. If we do this and it does have even a small tightening effect, it does imply that short-term rates are lower for longer, so the “extended period” is extended.  I’m not sure that the distortions of extending that carry trade issue—raising long-term rates and keeping short-term rates lower for longer—aren’t greater than any distortions we’re causing by having a bunch of MBS in our portfolio.  So I would still favor waiting for the MBS sales. On the redemptions, or the exchange of Treasuries in any size for Treasury bills, I, too, was drawn to some extent to option 2—reinvest in shorter maturities.  I saw it as a way eventually of reducing a duration risk, giving Brian more options to absorb reserves when the time comes to do that, moving back towards a more traditional Treasury portfolio.  But I think, as I indicated in my opening comments, even option 2 would be a slight tightening of policy.  Whether these basis points are right, no one has any idea, right.  But it is a move in that direction, and, like you, Mr. Chairman, and President Rosengren, I see the economic outlook ashaving weakened just a little bit over the intermeeting period, and I don’t think this is the appropriate time to take even a potentially slight tightening alternative.  So I think at some point the Committee should look at option 2, but I wouldn’t do it right now. As for the swaps, $9 billion isn’t a big deal.  I certainly agree with that.  I guess what worries me about selling the $9 billion or rolling it into Treasuries is that it’s unusual, and we ought to be doing kind of what the markets do to facilitate this fails situation and not set ourselves communications challenges by doing something that’s inconsistent with regular market practice.  So I guess I have a slight preference for the swap alternative as opposed to some of these others.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Kohn, is expressing his own opinions and preferences on various options, but there is no mention of any disagreement with other individuals in the passage.


Passage number 108.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply a polite expression of gratitude from the speaker, President Lockhart.


Passage number 109.
 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only provides the name of Mr. Lacker and his title (Mr. Chairman), but there is no indication of any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement of identification.


Passage number 110.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without having the passage provided, it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement. Please provide the passage for a more accurate analysis.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 111.
 MR. LACKER.  Can I respectfully pose a question to Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of the phrase "Can I respectfully pose a question" implies a disagreement or difference of opinion between Mr. Lacker and Governor Kohn.


Passage number 112.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This word does not indicate contention or disagreement. It simply expresses agreement or certainty.


Passage number 113.
 MR. KOHN.  A long as it’s respectful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 114.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Two hundred twenty-two FOMC meetings—it had better be respectful.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "laughter" suggests a light-hearted or joking atmosphere during the FOMC meetings. The statement "it had better be respectful" indicates the expectation for a respectful tone during the meetings, but it does not imply disagreement.


Passage number 115.
 MR. LACKER.  How would Governor Kohn feel about selling MBS and buying equivalent duration Treasuries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking how Governor Kohn would feel about a certain scenario.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 116.
 MR. KOHN.  Obviously, less concerned.  I think if we had a good reason for doing that, and if it were well advertised ahead of time, and if I could be pretty sure it wouldn’t upend the mortgage market, obviously I’d be a little bit less concerned.I’m a little surprised, to tell the truth, about this discussion about buying Treasuries.  For example, when we talked about buying Treasuries, President Fisher, you were really concerned about its implications for perceptions of our independence.  I’m glad to hear you’re less concerned now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kohn, expresses surprise and disagreement with the concerns raised by President Fisher about buying Treasuries. While President Fisher was initially concerned about the implications for perceptions of independence, Mr. Kohn states that he is glad to hear President Fisher is now less concerned. This difference in opinion and perspective indicates contention or disagreement.


Passage number 117.
 MR. LACKER.  It’s eroded on so many other fronts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact, that something has eroded on many other fronts.


Passage number 118.
 MR. FISHER.  First of all, I wasn’t the only member—Governor Warsh also had some interesting arguments on that.  But I think it threatens our independence more to have skewed our holdings toward longer-term mortgage-backed securities.  But we can talk about that when I get my chance in the round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that Governor Warsh also had interesting arguments on the topic, but the speaker's main point is that skewing holdings toward longer-term mortgage-backed securities threatens independence.


Passage number 119.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Where are we.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Where are we" and mentioning President Lockhart does not indicate any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 120.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I line up with President Rosengren and with the gist of what Governor Kohn said.  First, I think we have two questions:  a direction of policy question, and a timing question.  I think there has been quite remarkable change since the last meeting—risk is higher, and uncertainty is a whole lot greater.  So, from a timing point of view, I would do nothing at this meeting that risks misinterpretation. I tend to look at these questions in a risk–reward sense.  I do not see the great reward in acting at this meeting on any of the moving parts of the policy direction.  I do see a risk not only of market misinterpretation, but, depending on the compounding effects of conditions that develop over the next few weeks, also of conceivably a policy error of some kind.  Directionally, then, I line up pretty much with what Governor Kohn just said—to shorten the maturities using option 2 or, conceivably, option 3.  I think that decision can be made at a later date.  Because it is a relatively small sum and it, in effect, will be interpreted as preserving the status quo, I would favor the coupon swaps idea.  I continue to favor sales after tightening.  And finally, at least asI’m thinking of it at this point, I see tightening as multi-modal.  We’ve talked about the tightening effects of a number of different possible actions, but I see it as one decision that comes at a particular time, and I would not want to risk the possibility that something that we do not think is tightening is interpreted by the market as tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is primarily expressing their opinion and agreement with other individuals.


Passage number 121.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only states "President Plosser" without any additional context or information, so there is no contention or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 122.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Can I just ask one clarifying question of Brian.  If we were to hold the 5.5s, given that they have large prepayment risks, what’s the anticipated duration of those securities.  In other words, if you replaced them with Treasuries of similar duration—this goes back to what President Lacker said—what would they be.  Five years, seven years, four years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply asking for clarification from Brian about the anticipated duration of the 5.5s securities.


Passage number 123.
 MR. SACK.  Oh, no.  It would be much shorter.  The duration of our agency MBS holdings broadly is between three and three and a half years, and presumably the duration of the 5.5s would be less than that on average.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It purely states the expected duration of the agency MBS holdings and mentions that the duration of the 5.5s would be less on average.


Passage number 124.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Because of prepayment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 125.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage only includes a statement from Mr. Sack but does not mention any opposing or conflicting viewpoints or claims.


Passage number 126.
  I don’t have the exact reading for that coupon, but— MR. PLOSSER.  So if you replaced those with Treasuries, you’d be looking at Treasury durations of three to five years, presumably.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a response to a question without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 127.
 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman, can I follow up on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification or further information.


Passage number 128.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the sentence "Okay."


Passage number 129.
 MR. LACKER.  Three to three and a half is the duration of our MBS holdings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a straightforward statement of the duration of the MBS holdings.


Passage number 130.
 MR. SACK.  Correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The speaker simply states that something is correct without expressing any contradictory opinion or disagreement.


Passage number 131.
 MR. LACKER.  And the duration of our overall Treasury portfolio is five and a half years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact about the duration of the overall Treasury portfolio, without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 132.
 MR. SACK.  Right.  Treasuries are our longest-duration asset right now in aggregate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a factual statement about the current state of Treasuries as the longest-duration asset.


Passage number 133.
MR. LACKER.  So our MBS are less than average duration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker simply states a fact about the duration of their MBS.


Passage number 134.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, it’s because of the level of interest rates.  It’s very sensitive to the level of interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the sensitivity of something to the level of interest rates. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 135.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  That’s because interest rates are so low that it means that the prepayment will be very rapid, and as a result, our balance sheet will shrink quite rapidly if interest rates stay this low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the impact of low interest rates on prepayment and the subsequent shrinkage of the balance sheet.


Passage number 136.
 MR. LACKER.  So what’s the duration of the public’s portfolio.  I’m trying to think, with respect to what Governor Kohn said—if we sold the MBS, that would increase the average duration of our portfolio, wouldn’t it. PARTICIPANT.  It depends on what you buy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange of information and clarification among the participants.


Passage number 137.
 MR. LACKER.  Because it’s below the Treasury duration, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage is simply stating a fact, that the duration is below the Treasury duration. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 138.
 MR. SACK.  Right, but if we just sold MBS and didn’t do anything else, it would be putting more dollar amounts of duration into the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Sack.


Passage number 139.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You are absolutely right.  If you swap for long-duration Treasuries, you increase the duration.  President Rosengren, you had a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the statement made by "President Rosengren" and adds information to support that statement.


Passage number 140.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  But it would also presumably change the mortgage rate relative to the Treasury rate.  So if the housing sector is one of the sectors that you think is particularly weak, it would be relatively unusual.  Even though it’s a change in duration, it’s also a change in composition that does have potential compositional effects, particularly on a sector that may be weak otherwise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It discusses the potential effects of a change in mortgage rate relative to the Treasury rate on the housing sector, acknowledging that it could have compositional effects on a potentially weak sector.


Passage number 141.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information given to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 142.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If it weren’t for the communication issues about what it might signal for monetary policy, I’d tend to think that redeeming Treasuries alonewould have relatively small effects, and I’d tend to favor doing something like that to get our balance sheet down.  But that’s not the case—there are communication issues. I think it would have been nice if, along the way, we had known that it was okay to make technical adjustments in the size of our balance sheet—in some of these components, in relatively small dollar amounts—over, say, a six-month period; we’re obviously struggling with a whole number of these issues.  You know, I’m the kind of person where, within certain bands, small adjustments don’t bother me.  The markets apparently are going after nickels and so on, so that a small change matters a lot to them.  But we’re going to struggle with this with the term deposit facilities, the $9 billion of coupon swaps, and other things that are going to come along, and it’s always going to have an effect of a couple of basis points.  It would be nice if we could have somehow communicated that there’s a range of noisy adjustments that are going to be natural for us to do. However, it does have implications about what it means for tightening, and so I don’t think there’s much of a reward here.  As President Lockhart mentioned, the risk is larger than I would like, and the dual mandate issues say to me that we need to maintain accommodation.  So I tend to favor option 1—roll over the Treasuries and keep the monetary policy accommodation.  I certainly would not object to reinvesting in shorter-maturity Treasuries.  But I would go ahead and roll them over.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their own thoughts and preferences regarding monetary policy.


Passage number 143.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And on the asset sales, the MBS sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the passage. It simply states that MBS sales are happening without any indication of conflicting perspectives or opinions.


Passage number 144.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes, I wouldn’t do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans simply states that he wouldn't do something without any opposing or conflicting opinion being expressed.


Passage number 145.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 146.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Three questions, I think, have been raised.  One, on the coupon swaps, let me just underscore what Brian said, which is that this is veryordinary, customary, boring, not very exciting or surprising news to people in markets—these things do happen all the time.  So in that way I’m in total agreement with him and the New York folks.  I would just point out that I don’t think that this is a one-off problem.  If only we had bought one class of securities instead of another, then things would be fine.  This is symptomatic.  This is indicative of a very messed up mortgage finance system and of extraordinary efforts by all sorts of government actors, including the Federal Reserve, to intervene in it.  So, while we’re clearing up this symptom, and I think that we should, I wouldn’t be dismissive of this problem, and I’d suggest that we’ll see different strings of it manifest themselves in different ways over the course of the next couple of years. Second, on the redemption policy, I favor option 2 in substance.  I think that gives to Brian, who has to deal with all of us, a little bit more flexibility than option 1 does, so I think that’s necessary to ensure that we can functionally provide what he and the Desk need to provide.  So option 2 is fine.  In terms of the communication of option 2, I would add that to the burdens we are going to put on the Chairman for Humphrey-Hawkins.  I think that if the Chairman can lay out at a high level what the music is, then Brian and the New York Desk can play out the lyrics as to the technical issue of what’s going on and do that in a way which is not scary.  I think all of us around this table, myself included, do tend to make a lot out of the communications challenges and what markets want and need, but these markets can be led, and they can be led ably to good places, so we ought not be intimidated by that prospect. On the subject of asset sales, Mr. Chairman, I think I’m going to take your counsel and not re-litigate the discussion we had last time.  I’ll just make two points in light of more recent events coming out of Europe.  First, I think Europe should remind us of the need to have optionality associated with all that we’re going to do under a narrative that is playing out withmarkets.  The downside risks that are now obvious in Europe, which were feared and understood six weeks ago, should remind us of the multiple policy tools that we now have, and, speaking for myself, I think that we should keep plenty of flexibility about the deployment of those tools.  Some of those are little water pistols, and some of those are nuclear weapons, and I wouldn’t want to confuse them and say we’ve got this big closet and it’s just filled with a bunch of guns.  So my own view would be that, when we think about the size and composition of our balance sheet, we would be well served to keep that separate from, but certainly related to, our decision on policy rates.  I think the minutes accurately reflected where we were last time.  I think that optionality would be a good thing for us to get back to in future discussions, but we’re probably not going to be able to accomplish that today.   The second new news, it strikes me, out of Europe that informs this decision is that the problems there, which are very significant, have had a far more material impact on risk-free rates—on the Treasury curve and on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for folks that are buying a first house—than a trillion dollars of assets that this Committee has undertaken.  I just want to put that which we’re debating in the broader context:  Europe should remind us that what we’re contemplating is relatively small.  I have great confidence that it can be properly communicated both in the forthcoming discussions the Chairman has in Humphrey-Hawkins and beyond.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their agreement with certain points and offering their own perspective and suggestions.


Passage number 147.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any statements or arguments that can be considered contentious or lead to disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Pianalto.


Passage number 148.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On asset sales, I am where the majority of the Committee was at our last meeting, and I prefer to wait on asset sales until we start raising interest rates.  I support giving the Desk the authority to conduct the coupon swaps to facilitate the settlement of our MBS purchases.Regarding Treasury redemptions, given my outlook, which I’ll talk about in the next go-round, I prefer option 1.  I, too, would like to reduce the duration of our Treasury holdings as presented in option 2, but, given the communications risk that we’ve talked about and also Brian’s comment that option 2 could put some modest upward pressure on long-term interest rate, I prefer to stay with option 1 at this meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Pianalto is expressing her support for waiting on asset sales until interest rates are raised and her preference for option 1 regarding Treasury redemptions.


Passage number 149.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Who’s next.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Thank you. Who's next. President Yellen" seems to be a series of polite expressions and a potential question about the next speaker or participant in a conversation or event.


Passage number 150.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to associate myself particularly with the comments of President Rosengren and Governor Kohn.  I agree with everything they’ve said.  To me, a key issue is that the macroeconomic outlook is weak, and, since our last meeting, I think it has deteriorated.  So I think macroeconomic considerations continue to call for accommodative policy and, ideally, even more accommodative policy than we have now.  I wouldn’t do anything now that could be interpreted in any way as a tightening of policy or undertake anything that could, because of the communications difficulties associated with it, lead markets to believe that we are likely to tighten policy any sooner than they now think. On asset sales, I feel we’ve had an excellent discussion.  I think every possible issue has surfaced.  I was certainly in the majority at the last meeting.  My views on this haven’t changed at all.  I think it is a sound decision to sell assets, but to do so only after we’ve made a decision to tighten monetary policy, and to start that off with an increase in our target for a short-term interest rate. On issues like President Lacker’s suggestion—selling off MBS and replacing them with Treasuries within a constant size balance sheet—I certainly agree that eventually we want to get back to a portfolio that’s Treasury-only.  That’s a principle I don’t have any trouble endorsing.  But I don’t see a compelling reason to get out of MBS and to get into Treasuries at a very rapidrate that would necessitate the kind of strategy that President Lacker has proposed.  I don’t see any enormous distortion that the composition of our portfolio is causing at this point that makes me see a compelling reason for doing this quickly. On Treasuries, I would see anything other than option 1 today as some tightening in policy, and certainly there are communications challenges associated especially with option 4, but also even with option 2.  I do, like others, see a good reason to proceed eventually to shorten the maturity of our portfolio, to reduce interest rate risk.  So option 2 is attractive, but I wouldn’t move on that today. With respect to the coupon swap issue, I would proceed precisely as Brian proposed and replace the 5.5s with 4.5s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement with the comments of President Rosengren and Governor Kohn, and states their own views on macroeconomic considerations and asset sales. There is no mention of any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 151.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota, would you like to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents an invitation for President Kocherlakota to make a comment.


Passage number 152.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Sure.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll talk about the three issues that are on the table.  I’ll talk first about the coupon swap issue.  On that, I think President Lacker phrased it exactly right.  We would be talking about whether or not we should be selling.  The transaction is twofold—we’re selling and then buying.  I think we basically committed to a particular amount of MBS that we wanted to buy, and we should just stick to that.  I think Brian has outlined a way to get around what I see as a largely technical problem, so I’m happy to go along with that.  I think doing otherwise, as some have suggested, is essentially to undo the commitment we made to get to the level that we were talking about.  If the amount of money involved were $100 billion as opposed to $9 billion, suddenly it wouldn’t be viewed as largely technical. Let me move to President Hoenig’s memo, which I thought was excellent.  In general, I’m in favor of trying to put a cap on the amount of reserves that are out there, that is, the size ofthe monetary base.  I think this cap on the size of the monetary base coming out of the reserve requirement puts a cap on the size of M1.  That cap is a backstop that keeps the price level in check, even if we, for some reason, fail to use our interest rate tools in a sufficiently aggressive fashion.  Maintaining a large monetary base essentially means that we’ve discarded this backstop against the consequences of our own mistakes; I think experiences, for example, the Gulf of Mexico, show the value of having good backstops, ones that actually work.  We’ve talked about asset sales at great length, as President Yellen said.  I’ll just say one argument that occurred to me recently that I had not thought of before, which is about communication.  I think it’s going to be a lot more difficult to separate the communication about interest rates and balance sheets when we’re actually starting to move interest rates.  Right now, we’ve got this commitment on the table—this “extended period” language—and I think it quite rightly, I will add, given the economic conditions, says to markets that we’re at zero for a long time to come.  In those circumstances, it’s much easier to say, “Okay, we’re going to start to reduce our balance sheet, but that’s not going to be spilling over into our management of short-term interest rates.”  That’s the main thing you have to worry about here—that spillover.  These 5 to 10 basis point estimates—yes, it’s tightening.  The term deposit facility test itself offered people 27 basis points as opposed to 25—that was 2 basis points of tightening.  Everything we do to take out reserves in some sense will have some amount of tightening. I don’t think it’s this 5 to 10 basis points we’re talking about.  It’s the spillover into short-term interest rates that we’re worrying about.  I think it will be much easier to control that communication now, when we’ve got this strong commitment on the table.  So I’d be very comfortable with the gradual five-year program that President Hoenig suggested starting in mid-2011.  We’ve moved expectations about when we were going to start sales tremendously.  If youlook at the June dealer survey that the New York Fed did, now I think about 50 percent the respondents think we’re going to sell within the next two years.  That’s a big change relative to where we were in January of this year.  So I think moving to starting to sell by mid-2011 would have very little impact on long-term interest rates. Finally, consistent with my vision that we should have a smaller balance sheet, I like the idea of holding only Treasuries in the long run, but I want to get our balance sheet down fast.  Zero reinvestment, full redemption policy is consistent with that.  I think communication is critical to this.  This is a Committee that has done wonders over the last two and a half years with communication.  I don’t view this as being a huge obstacle for us to overcome.  I’ll sketch some language tomorrow about how I’d like to proceed on that.  I think we could use the minutes now, Humphrey-Hawkins testimony along the way, and make a formal statement in the statement about going to zero reinvestment in August.  I think I’ve touched on all three issues.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any significant disagreement or contention. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, is discussing various issues and stating his opinions on each of them.


Passage number 153.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher, would you like to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking President Fisher if they would like to provide a comment.


Passage number 154.
 MR. FISHER.  May I first ask two questions.  The first is:  Are we indemnified from losses on MBS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply stating a question asked by Mr. Fisher.


Passage number 155.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Indemnified.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The term "indemnified" does not necessarily imply any form of disagreement or contention. It simply means that someone is being protected or compensated for potential losses or damages.


Passage number 156.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I can't generate a response without more information about the passage or context.


Passage number 157.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage is not providing any conflicting viewpoints or expressing disagreement. It is simply asking for a yes or no response.


Passage number 158.
 MR. FISHER.  Not by the Treasury.  Second: When is the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information about the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.


Passage number 159.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The third week in July.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "The third week in July" does not express any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a specific time period without any conflicting statements.


Passage number 160.
MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, you went back to the last meeting and the four principles agreed upon, which reminded me that I had forgotten my manners.  I just wanted to thank everybody for the support they’ve given me during a very difficult period. Setting aside sentiments—and central bankers are not supposed to have any feelings whatsoever and are supposed to be objective—the one thing about taking a month off is this:  When you read these materials and think about the things that we have discussed and look at them with fairly fresh eyes, at least to me—and Narayana touched on this—the issue of whether we wait to tighten before we sell assets is interesting.  I can envision circumstances where we might tighten, and the impact would be such that, at the longer end of the yield curve—at least in the middle section of the yield curve—we might shift from gains to losses on our holdings.  We’re not indemnified against those losses, and I could see where the political costs—I know we’re not supposed to think about politics just like we’re not supposed to be emotional—could be great, and we could be criticized for having pursued a bad strategy ex post.  I would note that we pursued this strategy deliberately, and Governor Kohn and I supported the purchase of mortgage-backed securities for a specific purpose, and I think we have achieved our goal. As you, Mr. Chairman, and President Yellen and others have correctly pointed out, the macroeconomic situation has deteriorated, but it hasn’t disintegrated.  It’s not as bad as it was, and the financial conditions now are much better than they were when we implemented this program.  So I think we need to take that into account. The reality is that there is a demand for this product in the marketplace.  What people are being offered for cash is negligible.  I would be willing to submit that we could sell a decent portion of our mortgage-backed securities to hungry buyers.  However, I would agree that this is not the time now to reduce our balance sheet size, and in fact, if you do worry about some of thetail risks of a weaker economy because of the trip wire of Europe or whatever it may be, I’d like to have a little dry powder in my pocket.  I think we could achieve this by taking advantage of market conditions.  I’m not going to go as far as Governor Warsh—actually rooting for further weakness in Europe and disintegration of Europe—but we are the beneficiary of the misfortune of others.  Whatever the reason, it gives us an opportunity at least to consider the subject of whether or not we can sell some of this portfolio, which we all agree is disproportionate to our long-term goals; that is, we could take advantage of that and at least test the possibility.  I would be in favor of reinvesting it in Treasuries.  I think President Lacker raised a good point, which is that we might even, if we wanted to—and I’m not sure that’s the objective of the exercise—extend the duration of the portfolio by doing so. So I’m uncomfortable with taking it off the table, Mr. Chairman.  I think it is a question of communication.  I don’t think it necessarily leads to tightening, Governor Kohn.  I’m not necessarily in favor of tightening right now, but I am concerned that this is a tool that we used.  It worked.  It may no longer be entirely appropriate to carry this in our portfolio, if we can shed it without taking losses and without necessarily impacting the current duration of the portfolio or even shrinking our balance sheet. That would be my perspective on this issue.  It sounds like there are many people at the table who disagree, but whatever we decide, I would be in favor of your doing this through the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, because, I hope, by then, we will have gotten through all of the deregulation and re-regulation and all of that political argument that’s taking place on the Hill and get back to discussing monetary policy.As to the options laid out by Brian, my favorite, although I don’t view it as optimal, would be option 2.  It reduces the duration.  It keeps the balance sheet roughly the same size for now.  It gives us a bigger chunk of securities with maturities a year or less to work with. But I’m a little concerned, Mr. Chairman, that we’re just ruling out taking an opportunity here when the market is very strong, and I think we can do it in a way that isn’t disruptive.  The question is:  How do you communicate it.  That’s a tough one.  I think we can come up with answers.  We can talk about that later.  I think you could communicate in Humphrey-Hawkins, and we can do so without damaging our obligation to live up to the dual mandate that we are governed by.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is expressing his perspective and opinions on the topic being discussed, but he does not directly challenge or disagree with any other members of the group.


Passage number 161.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard, would you like to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite request for President Bullard to comment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 162.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On the Treasury redemption and reinvestment policy, I just wanted to say I found the memo on this topic from Brian Madigan and Brian Sack very helpful.  So thanks a lot to you and to everyone who worked on that. I prefer the status quo policy for today, which is to continue to reinvest according to long-standing practice without any additional attempt to shorten the maturity structure.  Mainly I agree with many others here that we probably should not try to send a signal on monetary policy today.  We could move to that policy later.  I don’t think it would have a big effect at the time that we decide to do that. On the full redemption policy, while I have some sympathy for that, I think that would move the Committee away from the desired ultimate asset composition, which is Treasuries-only.  I think that would send a confusing signal and might be confusing to us as well about what we’re trying to do here.  We can achieve much more by simply selling agency MBS at the appropriate pace and at the appropriate time so as to reassure markets that the FOMC remainscommitted to achieving low and stable inflation outcomes.  I think there’s some good news, namely, that the MBS are actually in demand—that’s encouraging.  I’m also fine with the swaps for the 5.5 fails.  The main concern I’d have there is whether we’re doing anything unusual or anything that would look like a favor to those that have failed to deliver.  As I understand it, I don’t think that we’re doing that—we’re using normal market procedures here.  But I would be concerned about anything that would smack of somehow letting people out of a contract or something.  But I don’t get the sense that that’s what we’re doing here. On asset sales, I still advocate the LIFO policy—last in, first out—which would put asset sales before the first increase in short-term interest rates.  I think it makes sense to take back the quantitative easing at the appropriate time—not today, but at the appropriate time—without tying it to short-term interest rate increases. I actually am quite concerned about the policy that seems to be gelling around the table here—raising short-term interest rates and simultaneously signaling the end of the quantitative easing policy—because that is an “everything at once” policy, and we’re not taking advantage of the fact that we have two instruments.  One could interpret the policy of raising rates, or even hinting that we’re going to raise rates by changing the language, as simultaneously signaling two things:  that we’re going to raise rates and that, within some short period of time, we’ll start to end the quantitative easing policy.  That might be more tightening than is desired at that moment. I think the better way to play this is to say that we would take back the quantitative easing, which is the last thing we did, without necessarily signaling anything about what we’re going to do with interest rates; we even could extend the “extended period” language and say we might wait on interest rate policy, and we’ll get the balance sheet back to a more normal size and a more normal composition in a reasonable amount of time.I am very concerned about this “everything at once” policy, and I think I’ll remain an advocate for the LIFO policy for now.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, expresses disagreement with the policy of raising short-term interest rates and simultaneously signaling the end of the quantitative easing policy. He advocates for a different approach, known as the LIFO policy, which would involve taking back quantitative easing before increasing short-term interest rates.


Passage number 163.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply expresses gratitude.


Passage number 164.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m where many others have already expressed themselves.  I would not want to do anything that would be or could be construed as a monetary policy tightening in light of the fact that the economic outlook has deteriorated since the last meeting.  Financial conditions have tightened, and tail risks have increased.  I thought it was interesting that, in the submissions of the participants’ forecasts, there’s a big shift in the Committee’s view about risks lying to the downside now in terms of their growth outlook. With that in mind, while I don’t like the composition of our Treasury portfolio—I would prefer it to be shorter-dated—I don’t think this is the time to make any changes.  At some point I might favor option 2, but not today. In terms of asset sales, I’m very much where I was at the last meeting, and that was with the majority.  I thought the majority of the Committee had come out pretty clearly that first it’s language, then it’s interest on excess reserves, and then it’s asset sales.  I would, if anything, want to reinforce that, if we could, because there’s too much confusion in the marketplace about whether the Committee has decided this or not. Regarding the swap, I think what Brian has proposed is very straightforward, completely technical, standard operating procedure, and involves the least drama.  So I very much favor doing the swap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 165.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a simple expression of thanks and a greeting to someone named Governor Duke. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 166.
MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I think we run the risk of getting a little too cute in what we’re trying to do.  It’s my belief that, in execution, consistency is a strength.  Given the communication challenges that we face, I think consistency is even more important for us than would normally be the case. Starting with asset sales, I think we should have a reason to revisit the conversation we had last time rather than having this constant tug of war with one side or the other making marginal progress at any given meeting. With that said, in terms of the swap, I think our policy decision was to purchase MBS.  It wasn’t to purchase specific coupons, and risking a communication problem for $9 billion just doesn’t make any sense to me. On the Treasury redemptions, I strongly favor option 2, with the caveat that there be enough time for it to be well communicated.  We have said that we want to return to a more normal portfolio composition, and I think that should also apply to the maturity structure and the duration within the Treasury portfolio.  Option 1 basically never exits from the $300 billion Treasury LSAP—it mainly exits from our old position.  Option 3 presented challenges of execution in the secondary market.  So I particularly like option 2.  I view option 2 as sort of the equivalent of gradually letting MBS roll off, in that it’s a gradual and incremental type of strategy.  It would give us future flexibility at a time when we might really need it, and it would reduce the political risk of large, unrealized, or potentially realized losses as rates increase.  I don’t think this is a sudden decision.  We’ve had the discussion of what to do about Treasuries at least three times, by my count, and we’ve been talking about it just as long as we’ve been talking about the exit.  I think if we wait for the perfect time to address the duration in the portfolio, then the actions that are required to do so might be even more disruptive to markets.  Option 2 seemsto me the easiest strategy to communicate, and while markets might not be expecting it now, it would be easy to change that expectation.  As Brian points out, one reason that markets might not expect options 2 or 3 is that they just haven’t thought about it, so if we gave them a chance to think about it, it might make sense. Finally, to the independence question, it seems to me that option 1 totally relinquishes our independence, because we’re buying whatever Treasury wants to sell.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any significant contention or disagreement. Ms. Duke is expressing her opinions and preferences on various matters, but there is no indication of conflict or debate.


Passage number 167.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What about the asset sales, the MBS sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply mentioning the asset sales and MBS sales without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 168.
 MS. DUKE.  No—I think we ought to stay with what we did last time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. DUKE simply expresses her opinion that they should stick to what they did last time, without any opposition or contradiction mentioned.


Passage number 169.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 170.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was looking for one of what is now a fleeting number of opportunities just to agree with everything that Don says.  The problem is that, he said so many wise things, I can’t remember them all, so I’m going to have to go one by one, but I think I agree with virtually everything that he said. I would just add one thought.  Classic risk–reward calculus suggests to me that now is not the time to be taking any action on asset sales or anything that looks unusual to the markets at all.  I am mindful of what Kevin said and agree with him that we should be prepared as a Committee and through the voice of the Chairman to lead market expectations rather than just feel as though we’re slaves to those expectations, but I guess I would say, Kevin, that I don’t think this is one of those moments for two reasons.  First, with the deterioration of real economic conditions and the big potential problems in Europe, it seems to me that markets are likely to regard as particularly curious and perplexing any indication of a shift in policy by the Committee right now.  Second, the Chairman doesn’t testify until the third week in July.  We’re just barely into the fourth weekof June right now, and a lot can change between now and then.  So I would be inclined, as Dennis said, to stand pat across the board. With respect to asset sales, what Jim and Kevin have said is something that we may want to think about at some point in the future, although my default position is still the majority one that the Chairman read. With respect to the Treasuries, I’m with a substantial majority of the Committee, in that option 2 strikes me as the right one eventually.  But, for the reasons I just stated, now is not the moment.  I guess this next point is almost anticlimactic, but in light of all of that, I obviously endorse the proposal that Brian made on the swaps.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with virtually everything that was said by another person in the conversation.


Passage number 171.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I think everyone has spoken.  I recognize that we have not been completely efficient in our discussions, but I found this very useful, and I think positions are at least gelling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage indicates that there was some inefficiency in the discussions, but it also suggests that the speaker found the discussions useful and feels that positions are coming together (gelling). There is no explicit mention of contention or disagreement among the participants.


Passage number 172.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  The refrigerator’s not cold but it’s gelling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement about the refrigerator not being cold but gelling is likely meant to be humorous, as indicated by the laughter.


Passage number 173.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me try to make a couple of points, which I took from this discussion, and then we’ll be able to enjoy a cup of coffee. First of all, Brian, I think that most people think that the coupon swaps idea is worth doing, and we’ll put that into the directive tomorrow. On the Treasury redemptions—it was a very interesting discussion.  We’ll discuss these issues further in the policy go-round tomorrow.  I think that many people were motivated today by concerns about not rocking the boat or conveying any change in policy at this juncture and, therefore, the preference was clearly for no change, for option 1, for this meeting.  However, there was a lot of interesting discussion not so much about the size of the balance sheet, but about the composition of the balance sheet; in particular, the change that got the most attentionwas shortening the Treasury maturities, option 2.  I heard quite a bit of interest in the possibility that, if conditions warrant, if the outlook strengthens, we might prepare the ground for a shortening of maturities in that way—I thought there was considerable interest in that.  We may try to clarify a bit tomorrow exactly what conditions would warrant it, but I think it’s entirely possible that something about the composition of the balance sheet could be in my testimony, for example. The other issue of composition involves MBS versus Treasuries, and President Lacker was, I guess, the strongest advocate.  I think that’s certainly worth considering.  Not too many people picked it up at this juncture, but it certainly is true that, if communicated adequately, we could change the composition of our balance sheet without changing the overall thrust of the duration, at least.  As President Rosengren pointed out, there would be some implications for mortgage markets versus other markets, but I think that that is an interesting alternative. I didn’t hear much support at this juncture for reducing the size of the balance sheet at this time.  I think it should be noted, and the minutes should continue to note, that the absolute majority of people who spoke still prefer the notion of sales after increased interest rates.  But what I took from that is that we shouldn’t be selling until we believe that we are close to the point where policy needs to be tightened, that is, where macroeconomic and financial conditions are such that tightening looks to be in the offing.  I could imagine, for example that, at a point at which tightening is beginning to look necessary, we might start with an announcement that in six months we will begin sales, and then be able to observe that effect, and then make an announcement on interest rates subsequently.  Then, temporally, the interest rate would still be in front of the sales, but the announcement might come first.  So I think there are variants that we could talk about, but, for the time being, I did hear very little interest in immediate sales, and, inparticular, I heard a preference for holding sales as a part of the tightening process once we are convinced that financial and economic conditions warrant it. Are there any comments.  [No response]  Well, again, I thank you for a very frank and very useful discussion.  Why don’t we take 20 minutes for coffee.  We’ll come back for the chart show.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply summarizes different points made during a discussion and does not show any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 174.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don’t we reconvene.  Item 2.  We’ll have the presentation on the economic and financial situation by Bill Wascher, Chris Erceg, and Nellie Liang.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply provides instructions for reconvening and mentions the individuals who will give a presentation.


Passage number 175.
 MR. ENGLISH.4  Thank you, Nellie.  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections.”  Exhibit 1 depicts the broad contours of your current projections for 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run.  Almost all of you continue to project a gradual economic recovery, with GDP growth (the top panel) picking up a bit, the unemployment rate (the second panel) slowly trending lower, and inflation (the third and fourth panels) remaining subdued over the next few years. Exhibit 2 reports the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for calendar years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run; the corresponding information about your April projections is indicated in italics, and the current and previous staff projections are included as memo items.  On balance, your forecasts for this meeting generally suggest a slightly weaker path for the real economy and a bit less inflation than you projected at the time of the April meeting.  In your forecast narratives, a number of you noted that these changes were the result of incoming data and the expected effects on the U.S. economy of the European fiscal crisis.  As shown in the top panel, the central tendency of your growth projections for this year is slightly lower than in April; most of you now anticipate that real GDP will increase  4 The materials used by Mr. English are appended to this transcript (appendix 4).3 to 3½ percent in 2010, versus 3¼ to 3¾ percent in the previous forecast.  You see growth stepping up to 3½ to 4¼ percent in 2011 and remaining near those rates in 2012.  The downward revisions to your growth forecasts for this year are similar to those in the staff forecast, but the Tealbook projection for growth for next year has been revised down more substantially than the central tendency of your projections, from 4.4 percent in April to 3.7 percent in the current round.  Both the central tendency and the range of your estimates of the longer-run sustainable rate of GDP growth, the right-hand column, are the same as in April. Your unemployment rate projections are summarized in the second panel.  The central tendency for the average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year is 9¼ to 9½ percent, little changed from April.  But, consistent with your expectations of only a gradual economic recovery, all but one of you anticipate that the unemployment rate will remain above 8 percent at the end of next year.  Moreover, most of you project that the unemployment rate will be about 7 to 7½ percent even in late 2012—well above the unchanged 5 to 5¼ percent central tendency of your estimates of the unemployment rate that would prevail over the longer run in the absence of further shocks, which is shown in the right-hand column.  It appears that most of you, like the staff, continue to anticipate that the long-run performance of the labor market will not be significantly undermined by the substantial economic downturn and the slow recovery. You generally project that inflation will remain subdued, and the dispersion of your inflation projections has narrowed somewhat since April, particularly for this year and next.  The central tendencies of your projections for core PCE inflation for 2010 and 2011, shown in the fourth panel, have shifted down a bit and now run ¾ to 1 percent this year and about 1 to 1¼ percent next year before rising to 1 to 1½ percent in 2012.  The central tendencies for headline inflation, shown in the third panel, follow a broadly similar path.  Most of you project that headline inflation will stay at or below the 1¾ to 2 percent central tendency for the “mandate-consistent” inflation rate, shown in the right-hand column, throughout the projection period. Your views on the outlook for inflation continue to differ somewhat from the staff’s. In each of the three years, the Tealbook forecasts for total and core inflation are generally at or below the lower limits of the central tendencies of your projections.  This difference in views helps explain why a sizable majority of you anticipate that it will be appropriate to begin increasing the federal funds rate earlier than is assumed in the Tealbook. As shown in exhibit 3, three-quarters or more of you continue to be more uncertain than usual about your projections for growth and PCE inflation, the solid bars in the two left-hand panels.  As shown in the top right panel, about half of you now judge that the risks to output growth are tilted to the downside, a significant change from your assessments in April.  Most of you continue to view the risks to the inflation outlook, the bottom right panel, as balanced, though there has been a smallshift toward downside risks here as well.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  We’d be happy to take your questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply summarizing the projections and forecasts of the FOMC participants.


Passage number 176.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me thank the staff for a very comprehensive presentation.  I want to take special note of the section on financial stability, which reflects requests that we had at the last meeting.  Besides the presentation, of course, some memos were also circulated.  If you have additional requests for future presentations, or you have metrics or data that you’d like to submit for inclusion in a presentation, please don’t hesitate to do so.  Also, I think it would also be remiss of me not to take note of the Tealbook [laughter], which, of course, is a perfect combination of blue and green, which I found very convenient.  Again, if anyone has any suggestions, I’m sure the staff would be happy to hear them.  Are there questions for our colleagues.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply expressing gratitude and giving an opportunity for feedback or suggestions. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 177.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I found the financial stability memos and briefing very, very helpful, and I just wanted to follow up on your comment on Greece and Portugal and the notion that, while a default isn’t imminent, it may occur over time.  My reading of the Reinhart and Rogoff book was that they highlighted sovereign defaults that were often accompanied by very large exchange rate movements as well, and I take it that that’s not embedded in your longer-run forecast.  I was wondering if you could talk about how you would see the Greeks making a choice in the situation that default is likely to occur.  Would they choose to restructure or would they pull out of the euro and revalue their exchange rate, which would give them a terms of trade advantage to offset some of their unemployment problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a request for clarification and further discussion on the potential actions of Greece in the event of a default.


Passage number 178.
 MR. ERCEG.  Just to reiterate, certainly it’s not our expectation that Greece or Portugal would leave the euro area.  We think that, given the financial aid package to Greece, they have a strong incentive to continue with their program to try to reduce the primary deficit over the next couple of years, and we think it’s very unlikely that they would want to default.  At some pointdown the road, when their primary balance actually shifts back towards zero, then it’s quite possible that they would consider a strategic default.  It’s probably more likely under those circumstances that they would seek a restructuring, and we don’t think it’s very likely that they would actually attempt to leave the euro area.  Perhaps Nathan wants to add something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their belief and expectation regarding Greece and Portugal's actions and the likelihood of default or leaving the euro area.


Passage number 179.
 MR. SHEETS.  This is a really, really tough question—it throws us into a truly Knightian world, and I’m not quite sure how to parse out all the pros and cons.  My gut instinct is that, at some point over the next three to five years, the Greeks are going to have to restructure their debt.  I don’t expect them to leave the euro area, and my intuition for that is that leaving the euro area would be even more disruptive for them and for their economic relationships than the debt default would be.  I think that they’ve seen over the last decade that they benefit from deeper integration into Europe and the backstop that that provides.  I don’t think that it’s in their interest to leave, even if it would provide a temporary boost to their competitiveness.  Now, one can also argue that maybe Europe is going to decide they don’t want them anymore, and they’re going to develop new institutions to give them the capacity to eject a member—again, we’re in kind of a Knightian world of all sorts of different options.  But I would put a fairly high probability on an eventual restructuring—at some point beyond the end of the forecast period, as Chris said.  They have enough money committed now to get them into 2012, but I really would not put a lot of weight on a country leaving the euro area—probably less than the 20 percent weight that Brian’s survey yielded.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing different possibilities and options regarding the Greek debt and its relationship with the euro area, but there is no explicit disagreement or conflicting opinions presented.


Passage number 180.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 181.
 MR. FISHER.  First, Mr. Chairman, on the Tealbook, I thought it was great, and I’ll add a little historical footnote.  The first use of the word “teal” as a color description was 1917. So it goes back in our history.  But it’s also forward-looking, because the Unitarian hymnal, which isgray, by the way, was translated into Spanish, and all of the hymns in Spanish are in what they call the Tealbook.  So thank you for looking forward to our universal language here in the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing additional information and expressing gratitude.


Passage number 182.
 MR. ERCEG.  Thank you for that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply shows someone expressing gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 183.
 MR. FISHER.  I have a couple of questions on the international section.  One inflationary impulse that I hear countering a tremendous amount of deflationary impulses relates to transportation.  The HARPEX Index and the Hamburg Index, which measure container transportation, have come up dramatically since mid-June, and you hear retailers complain about that.  Second, of course, is the expectation that Chinese prices are pretty stiff, given wage settlements and given what they’re asking for during the post-Christmas buying season in terms of clothing, shoes, and other things.  In your presentation for global economic growth, we have reduced our expectations, including for China, and I’m wondering how you account for these transportation pressures.  Is it slow steaming, or is it something else, a dynamic that’s in place. My second question is:  Are we likely to see the Chinese back off from some of these price demands.  The reason I ask is that I don’t believe there’s much likelihood that it will work its way through to consumption here, but it does impact retailers’ margins.  I’m curious as to what your views on those two issues are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker is expressing concerns about transportation pressures and the impact of Chinese price demands on retailers' margins.


Passage number 184.
 MR. ERCEG.  Certainly, Chinese trade has continued to boom in both directions:  Imports have been extremely strong and exports were extremely robust in the May data, which are the most recent.  Presumably, that has put upward pressure on transport prices.  Regarding those relative price changes, I’d be happy to defer to anyone who knows more about these particular markets, but, certainly, I think that Chinese demand really has steamed ahead.  It’s worth noting that in marking down our forecasts, it really is primarily in the expectation thatEurope’s woes will damp confidence.  If we look just at the incoming data, these economies look like they’re roaring ahead.  So, in formulating our forecast, there’s some tension between extremely strong economic growth numbers that are surprising us, as I mentioned, on the upside and concerns about how developments in Europe are likely to affect business confidence and what the effects through asset prices might be on financial markets, for instance. Regarding your second question about whether the somewhat weaker global outlook might mitigate these pressures boosting prices, certainly it stands to reason that the weak domestic demand in Europe could serve to diminish upward pressures on prices of traded goods.  Now, some of the price pressures could reflect secular developments in the Chinese economy, where they’re moving towards increasingly specialized goods and moving out of the low-tech areas, so those sorts of relative price changes could well be more enduring.  I would think of it as part of the transformation of the Chinese economy that we have seen in many of the emerging market economies that are further up the growth ladder, such as Korea; so some of that is probably enduring.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily discusses the strong growth and demand in Chinese trade, as well as the potential impact of Europe's economic woes on business confidence and asset prices. There is also a mention of the weak domestic demand in Europe potentially mitigating upward pressures on prices of traded goods. Overall, the passage presents a balanced and informative perspective without any clear disagreements or conflicts.


Passage number 185.

Passage number 186.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 187.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Looking at exhibit 14, I want to ask a sort of qualitative question, and that is:  In summary, how would you characterize our grasp of our system’s exposure, and I mean not only direct exposure, which is pretty well measured here, but also indirect, counterparty kinds of exposures, which, I guess, as of now we don’t fully understand because the stress test results are not known.  Contrast that, if you would, to the run-up to the seizing up of markets in September 2008.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question asking for a comparison of the understanding of "our system's exposure" before and after the market seizing up in September 2008.


Passage number 188.
MS. LIANG.  Supervisors have information they collected from the largest firms on the largest significant exposures, which include sovereigns, corporates, financial institutions; and, for a set of the largest firms, they have been collecting counterparty exposures on similar types of things for quite a while.  Again, these are the most significant exposures.  If you’re worried about the entire Greek economy and the whole retail exposure, they don’t have that totally.  I’m going to wrap that up into spillover effects.  It’s not financial spillover, but it’s spillover to the economy. There’s a little comfort, but we tried to emphasize how much concern there is about the quality of the data they have.  For example, there’s quite a bit of netting of things that goes on—there are certain conventions you follow to net for the regulatory reforms, and then there are different netting conventions firms might use for their own risk-management systems, which supervisors need to get into to see if they’re comfortable with them.  These don’t include contingent exposures, such as undrawn commitment lines or CDS written, those kinds of things.  I think there’s definitely a “next step” concerning what else they’re going to go in and get a little more information on, and conversations with the chief risk officers are ongoing right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides information and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 189.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for our colleagues.  [No response]  Seeing none, I think it would behoove us to get started on the go-around, if that’s okay.  We won’t take too long because we have, of course, our June dinner at the embassy this evening.  President Lockhart, would you like to kick it off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that they should begin the go-around and mentions a dinner event that they have later in the evening. They then invite President Lockhart to start the discussion.


Passage number 190.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I’ll talk about feedback from contacts in the Sixth District.  They have become more reserved in their optimism, less unambiguously confident that the recovery will continue, as the events and risk factors that accumulated since the last meeting have made business contacts “more pensive,” as described byone of our directors.  Among the accumulated events causing this reaction is the Gulf oil spill.  Because its direct effects are most felt in my District, I’d like to spend a couple of minutes commenting on the oil spill.  The direct effects of the spill on the Sixth District economy are, so far, quite modest.  About 130,000 jobs, not including those in exploration and drilling, are directly at risk, mostly in areas connected with commercial fishing, recreation, and tourism; then, ultimately, there will be some at risk in drilling and exploration.  In many instances, direct costs have been temporarily offset by cleanup spending and compensation by British Petroleum.  We’re closely watching port activity, but to date the effect on ports in the northwest Gulf area has been negligible. Aside from the angst that results from the environmental effects of the spill and the modest economic effect so far, there is concern that hurricane season will bring a storm that spreads the physical problem in unpredictable ways.  For example, contacts in the power industry are concerned about potential problems for upstream power-generating facilities that use near-coast river water for cooling.  So far, however, there have been no power disruptions. Deepwater drilling will be affected so long as the moratorium continues.  The estimates of job losses directly resulting from the moratorium range from 20,000 to 50,000 over the next 12 months.  Contacts in Louisiana expressed concern in recent board meetings about the longer-term costs of reduced drilling activity.  Given that the physical capital—rigs and associated equipment—that’s used in drilling operations is mobile and scarce, there is much concern that it will be deployed elsewhere in the world and that the energy industry and the region will be permanently affected. Although the measurable economic impact so far is limited, this episode is weighing heavily on the attitudes of households and businesses in the Gulf region and, I would suspect,with the American public more broadly.  I think uncertainty about the duration and extent of this growing environmental tragedy is contributing to what one of my directors called “an attitude of cautious pessimism.”  We have a team in our research department that’s dedicated to following the oil spill and its effects, and, if it’s appropriate, in future meetings I’ll report to the Committee on their findings. Before turning to the national economy and forecast, let me add a few other pieces of feedback from our recent soundings in the District.  The transportation and logistics sector is seeing exceptionally strong demand.  Because of large reductions of capacity during the recession, the increased demand is causing transport bottlenecks and giving service providers pricing power.  One contact believes wholesalers and retailers are using transport as a substitute for building inventories—that is, requiring more frequent and smaller lot shipments.  The CEO of a commercial airline reported a very strong resurgence of business travel, up an estimated 60 percent from a year ago.  Almost all our corporate directors reported strong cash accumulation, and this was confirmed by bank directors.  Loan demand, however, remains very weak.  Finally, at the May meeting of our Real Estate Advisory Council, members warned against becoming complacent about problems in the commercial real estate sector.  They felt the problem is not receiving sufficient attention, because the bulk of property loans has not yet come due. Turning to the national economy and the outlook, my reading of the national economic situation is that recovery continues, but incoming data are quite mixed, and potentially transitory sources of strength have not yet evolved to broad-based and sustainable final demand.  My sense is that the economy is moving through an ambiguous phase, and visibility has shortened due to the sovereign debt problems and the banking situation in Europe, softer consumer numbers, anda stall—admittedly, only one month’s data—in private job creation.  My previous forecasts have been somewhat less optimistic than the then-Greenbook and the central tendency of the Committee.  I’ve pushed up my estimate for second quarter growth, but otherwise have not changed my outlook from the last meeting.  My forecast now is close to the recent Tealbook for this year and next. Finally, as regards the balance of risks at this juncture, I have shifted from one of the one or two of us who weighted the risk to the upside at the last meeting and now I see it as balanced, so I’m directionally similar to the majority of the Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply providing information and sharing their perspective on various topics, such as the Gulf oil spill and the national economy. There is no indication of disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 191.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Thank you. President Plosser" does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 192.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, economic activity continued to show modest gains in the Third District across most of our sectors.  Residential real estate is the exception.  Our contacts say there has been a distinct softening in activity since the end of the tax credits, and builders report that they do not expect construction activity to pick up much this summer.  However, the tax credit clearly pulls sales forward, so it may take several months before we will be able to make a more informed assessment of the housing market.  On a positive note, foreclosures and mortgage delinquency rates in our states are showing signs of moderating and are considerably below those of many other states that enjoyed bigger booms and are now suffering sharper busts. Payroll employment in the three-state region increased during the three-month period ending in April, and the region’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 9.3 percent for the third consecutive month.  However, the number of unemployed people fell in April for the first time since the start of the recession.  Temporary Census workers have contributed to payroll employment growth in the District since February.  One contact, however, from a large nationalplacement company, said that orders for temporary workers were up sharply, perhaps reflecting some substitution from temporary private sector jobs into the Census jobs.  However, employment gains are likely to be slow.  The employment index in our business outlook survey of manufacturers turned negative in June for the first time in seven months.  In May, we asked a special question about hiring plans.  Nearly 59 percent of the firms said they expect to increase production in the next six months, but only 30 percent expected to hire additional workers to do it.  The others plan to increase hours worked of current staff.  Important reasons cited by firms for not hiring were concerns about future employment costs, including health care and taxes, and uncertainty about future product demand. Manufacturing activity remained positive in June.  However, our index of general activity fell from 21.4 in May to 8 in June.  That is its lowest level since turning positive in September of 2009.  However, underlying that, new orders and shipments remained strongly positive, at levels consistent with typical economic recoveries.  Prices remained subdued.  For manufacturers, the index of prices received fell but remained positive in June, while the prices paid index actually turned negative for this month.  In addition, manufacturing firms’ expectations for price increases over the next six months have fallen for the last two months.  Retailers report mostly flat selling prices. Overall, the optimistic tone from my District contacts has moderated somewhat since our last meeting.  However, the general outlook continues to be for modest gains in most sectors, and our leading indicators constructed for our remaining states have remained positive for the last five months. My view of the national economy is similar to what we see in the District.  The troubles in the euro zone have raised the risk around my forecast, and I have shaved my forecast foreconomic growth for this year by a tenth or two and raised my unemployment path somewhat over the horizon.  I have also shaded down my inflation forecast for this year, reflecting weak numbers that we have seen so far.  However, I expect inflation to increase gradually over the forecast horizon. I believe that we do have a sustainable economic recovery, and that that remains the most likely outcome, while acknowledging that the troubles in Europe represent a cloud for that forecast.  I am projecting GDP growth of around 3½ percent over the next two years, employment growth picking up over the rest of this year, and the unemployment rate falling gradually over the forecast horizon.  Data on hours worked are strong, are improving, and private demand for temporary workers remains an encouraging sign for future employment gains.  My baseline forecast already incorporates weaker growth than what the historical correlations in the data would suggest, given the depth of this recession.  The upside risk that I had in the last forecast is now balanced by the downside risk to growth from the fiscal strains in Europe.  So, though at the last meeting I thought the risks were tilted to the upside, now they’re balanced from my perspective. My inflation forecast continues to differ from the Tealbook.  In the near term, I expect underlying inflation rates to remain subdued, but I expect inflation to drift up gradually over the next couple of years, especially if we make no move to raise rates until the summer of 2012, as in the Tealbook.  I continue to believe that we will need to begin raising the fed funds rate in the second half of this year, as the growth rate of the economy, and, therefore, the underlying real rate of interest, begin to pick up, if we are to keep inflation and inflation expectations well anchored.  My underlying assumption of appropriate monetary policy in my forecast is that thefunds rates will reach about 1 percent by the end of this year, still very low by historical standards, and rise slowly thereafter.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is providing an overview of economic activity in his district and offering his own forecast and opinions on the economy. He does not present any conflicting views or engage in any debate with others.


Passage number 193.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you. President Rosengren" simply expresses gratitude towards President Rosengren with no indication of any conflicting viewpoints or disagreements.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 194.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At my directors meeting last week, several directors made an analogy to a turtle that had bravely stuck its head out in the first quarter, but quickly retreated to its shell in May.  [Laughter]  Most of the data we’ve seen reflects the period when the turtle was out of its shell, but, in the coming weeks, I’m afraid we’ll get confirmation detailing why the turtle’s courage was short-lived.  Many of my contacts highlighted that the headlines from Europe have caused them to reevaluate hiring and investment decisions, presumably linked in large part to the expectation of declining export demand as the dollar strengthens and many countries undertake fiscal tightening. My forecasts have been predicated on a fragile job market, partly offset by moderate growth in business fixed investment.  If my business contacts’ pullback in these key areas in the face of European problems is representative, then the risk of slower growth than I had previously forecast has increased.  And my concern over the outlook extends beyond the effects of European troubles, with state and local spending clearly in retreat, and with the housing sector likely faltering.  In sum, I am worried that the Tealbook may be too optimistic. In terms of financial markets, I am concerned about the effects of a gradual but cumulatively significant withdrawal from European exposures.  U.S. money market funds have been an important source of funding for European banks. My contacts with money market funds indicate that they are becoming increasingly concerned about exposure in Europe.  In particular, the money market funds are concerned that investors in their funds will flee if they see large exposures to Europe and cannot differentiate between sound and weak European names.  Ingeneral, there’s a lack of confidence in the political will to make adequate adjustments in Europe.  If my contacts are right, the problems emanating from Europe will gradually worsen.  I share many of their concerns, and I am more concerned about Europe being able to muddle through than is reflected in many of our briefing documents. Even if Europe is able to avoid a severe contraction and more significant financial problems, my outlook in the near term for the U.S. economy entails a heightened risk of deflation.  Spain and Ireland are experiencing deflation even before the full effect of fiscal austerity has been felt.  Japan remains in deflation and has shown little ability to pull out.  I am worried that we may be underestimating the risk of deflation and that we are placing too much weight on well-anchored expectations at a time when we are seeing disinflation in wages and declines in a surprising number of components of the CPI.  While I’m confident that we have the tools to offset inflation, the Japanese experience makes me less confident about the tools available to offset deflation.  Should the European problems cause an economic stall, the deflation risks would become even greater. Given the move towards fiscal austerity in the United States that is likely to be even more pronounced after the election, and given that alternative monetary policies have shown to be of only limited help, both here and abroad, it is not clear how forceful our response would or could be if the economy slows and we experience deflation.  This is a risk we should be seeking to minimize and is something we should take seriously as we think about adverse economic scenarios.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses a concern about the outlook for the economy and the effects of European troubles. They also express worry about deflation risks and the lack of tools to offset it.


Passage number 195.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is brief and does not express any opposing views or conflicting ideas. It simply expresses gratitude to President Pianalto.


Passage number 196.
  MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The incoming data since our last meeting were on balance largely consistent with my outlook for growth, although recent price and wagedata have caused me to revise my inflation projection downward slightly.  What has changed the most over the intermeeting period is my assessment of the risks to my outlook, and I want to focus on two key risks—the European debt crisis and the downward momentum in the inflation process. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the consequent financial turbulence has dominated financial market behaviors over the past several weeks.  Although this is troubling, my outlook assumes that European policymakers will prevent the crisis from escalating further.  In my forecast, the effects of the crisis on output are modest and result only from diminished export demand and a weaker euro.  Overall, I didn’t revise my forecast for output very much since our last meeting.  And with the Tealbook’s downward revision to output, our projections now are very close—both have moderate and unspectacular economic growth this year and next.  This outlook for growth is consistent with what I am hearing from my business contacts, who generally are reporting gradual growth  At the same time, many of my contacts are reporting concerns about the potential scope of the European debt crisis.  For example, a manufacturer of capital equipment used in steel production reported that his order backlog has already been reduced by a combination of weaker growth in southern Europe and exchange rate movements.  The effects on his output have been limited to date, but going forward he is concerned about a potential for further depreciation of the euro, which would likely turn his business sharply downward.  The European debt crisis is also having an effect on business sentiment.  Some of my contacts are quite concerned about the prospect of more trouble in financial markets, and they are saying that, if these concerns become realized, then we could see a slowing of projects that might otherwise be funded.Reports like these lead me to believe that the European debt crisis poses a substantial risk to my outlook.  My staff considered some alternative scenarios to the European sovereign debt crisis that were less dire than those in the Tealbook’s tail risk scenario but still substantial enough to create a risk to my outlook.  I don’t think these scenarios are very likely, but I do think that the European debt crisis merits close monitoring, and it is the main reason that I have shifted my risk to output from balanced to weighted to the downside. On the inflation front, most of the incoming evidence supports further disinflation.  With respect to the price data themselves, there is simply no momentum to signal an imminent upturn.  Core inflation, as measured by the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, continues to drift lower.  It dropped to 0.5 percent on a year-over-year basis in May, and that’s an all-time low.  Compensation growth also continues to weaken, pushing unit labor costs lower.  Furthermore, some of this downward momentum in inflation may be spilling over to inflation expectations.  In the past month, the Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations model, which limits the effect of flight-to-quality issues, shows a drop of over 15 basis points at all horizons less than 10 years.  These developments have caused me to revise down my inflation forecast, and it’s now more like that in the Tealbook in the medium term. Given that I have repeatedly revised down my inflation outlook, I am concerned that there may be downward momentum in the inflation process that I am not incorporating in my outlook.  And the European debt crisis also presents further downside risk to inflation through the exchange rate and weaker foreign growth.  In summary, the risks to my outlook for growth have shifted to the downside, and the risks to my outlook for inflation continue to be to the downside.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their assessment of the risks to their outlook for growth and inflation, based on the incoming data and the effects of the European debt crisis.


Passage number 197.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 198.
MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My colleague to my left, President Bullard, talked about LIFO accounting regarding our balance sheet.  In my District’s economy, we’re basically are fortunate to have been last into the recession, and we appear to be one of the first coming out.  There is some dissonance between what I’m seeing locally and what I’m hearing from the CEOs that I survey around the country.  So let me give you a brief report. As far as our District is concerned, we just received the May payroll employment figures, and our private sector payroll is up 4.7 percent year over year at an annual rate.  The unemployment rate stays steady.  We have a lot of people coming into our workforce.  There are some awfully good things happening in the Eleventh District from the standpoint of manufacturing employment--our index indicates it has risen to the highest level in three years. Our construction employment soared in April and continued to do so in May.  Interestingly, if you talk to the small retailers, particularly the convenience stores, they’re seeing a new influx of Mexican workers.  We’re not sure if they are coming from Mexico or from Arizona. Our housing inventory fell to a total of 6.9 months after a slight increase in February.  The leading index has risen now for the third consecutive month, and we find a modest pickup in input prices reported by our manufacturers, but there’s very little pass-through to consumer prices.  So our region is enjoying a robust emergence from the recession, which we went into very late.  As far as the national economy is concerned, I will just share the anecdotal evidence that I have picked up from the list that I gave you, Mr. Chairman.  I am going to use a term only to flatter my colleague from Minnesota, because I doubt the Minnesota Gophers have been talked about—it was a football team for many, many years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 199.
  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks for the flattery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply shows appreciation for the flattery received.


Passage number 200.
MR. FISHER.  That’s as much as you’re going to get.  And I warned you, Mr. Chairman, I would probably talk about a “Bronko Nagurski” economy.  Now, I’m probably the only person here old enough to remember who Bronko Nagurski was—maybe Governor Kohn also remembers [laughter].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that he will likely talk about a "Bronko Nagurski" economy and jokingly mentioning that he may be the only person present who remembers who Bronko Nagurski was. There is no conflicting statement or argument being made.


Passage number 201.
  Basically, you gave him the ball— MR. KOHN.  I taught him everything he knows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement that suggests one person taught another person something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 202.
  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  Yes, I know.  You gave him the ball if you wanted to run right up the middle and gain short yardage, which he was consistently good at doing, and for that he was named three times, at three different positions, as an All-Pro.  No one has broken that record. Why do I mention that.  Because what brought us out of the end zone was inventory correction.  That player’s legs are tired, and I think that has basically run its course.  I’m hearing that from almost every sector that I talked to.  The second yardage was gained by equipment and software, and again, even though that continues if you talk to computer manufacturers and others, you’re beginning to see a slowdown or a tempering of that activity.  The game has basically become a short yardage game, running up the middle, a cloud of dust, but still making forward progress on the field.  It’s standard blocking and tackling, and I think the pace has slowed down, and, therefore, I have revised down my expectations for the second half. Every single businesswoman or man I speak to that is in a position of leadership describes the following circumstances.  They have gone back to basic blocking and tackling.  They are beset not just by concerns about demands for products, say, in weakening areas like Europe, but also by something we have not mentioned, which I will refer to as random refereeing—that is, they beg for the huddle.  They say they’re going to give Bronko Nagurski the ball, and the ref comes up and says, “By the way, this time the first down is 15 yards.”  In other words, there is enormous uncertainty, which we discussed before, about the impact ofgovernment programs and regulation.  For example, one CEO reports that in the new health care bill there are 1,100 instances that are “to be determined” by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  There is no way you can cost out this random refereeing.  In the case of the casual dining sector, they estimate it will triple their personnel costs, or in the case of a large company like Exxon or AT&T, which has all the legal power in the world, they still cannot figure what the impact is going to be on the cost structure, which inhibits planning.  That is point number one. Point number two is that enormous cash build-up has taken place in the corporate sector.  According to the Wall Street Journal, which may or may not be reliable, the S&P 500 has built up $1.8 trillion in excess cash over the cash flow needs.  Every CEO or CFO I talk to has excess cash.  What are they doing with the excess cash.  They’re either buying their own stock—for example, Texas Instruments has bought 30 percent of its own stock—or they’re going to increase their dividend payments.  I’m having a hard time finding people who are willing to add to their workforce until the random refereeing stops, until there is greater certainty.  I am also deeply disturbed by a phenomenon that I have reported before regarding cap-ex intentions—if my contacts are going to expand plant and equipment, they don’t plan to do it here. So, Mr. Chairman, I would say we still have inhibiting factors, including uncertainty, which stems from external developments and the lack of clarity as to rules and regulations that are likely to impact those who hire, especially the small business sector that doesn’t have the resources that large corporations do to try to decipher what’s coming out.  These factors are going to inhibit employment growth; at the same time, they will hold inflation at bay. In concluding, I’d like to follow up on Sandy’s comment on her staff’s median CPI index and say that our trimmed mean index is, again, continuing to diminish and show less inflationary pressure.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions uncertainty and lack of clarity regarding rules and regulations that are likely to impact businesses. This uncertainty is causing businesses to hesitate in adding to their workforce and expanding plant and equipment. The speaker also mentions that this uncertainty is inhibiting employment growth. However, the speaker also states that this uncertainty will hold inflation at bay, suggesting that there might be disagreement or differing opinions on the impact of uncertainty on inflation.


Passage number 203.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage consists of a direct statement, followed by a polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 204.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to add my compliments to the staff on the Tealbook and the financial stability memos.  I thought they were really terrific, and I think they’ll help sharpen the focus of our discussions going forward. The data in my business reports indicate that the recovery is continuing at the moderate pace we’ve expected for some time now.  To me, it seems likely that the unevenness in some of the recent monthly data is symptomatic of this moderate pace.  I think it’s too early to infer much more than that, but the uncertainty is high.  Labor market improvements will be gradual for the foreseeable future, and the continued weakness in the jobs picture could weigh on household and business sentiment for some time. Regarding inflation, the data currently suggest that the pull from disinflationary forces is somewhat stronger than the anchor from stable inflation expectations—that’s a slight change in my perspective.  Because inflation is projected to underrun my 2 percent inflation goal over the medium term, according to FOMC central tendencies, it’s difficult for me to imagine altering our current accommodative policy stance over the next six months or so, and certainly not in a material fashion. Turning to my business reports, and in line with my assessment of the economic outlook, most comments fit into a “more of the same” theme.  Ford and GM both reported good results recently.  Incentives are not high.  Inventories are lean, and the current 11.5 million unit sales pace appears to be profitable.  The steel industry continues to bring more capacity back on line.  Smaller industrial segments that are indicative of future activity, like industrial packaging and strapping materials, continue to improve at a strong rate, but, while capital equipment is selling well, business sentiment about cap-ex spending remains weak.I will just pause and mention that I asked all of my manufacturing contacts whether they saw something in Europe that was materially different recently, and it just seems as if it’s much too early to tell, not surprisingly.  But I did get from them a sense that there’s still good momentum in their business activity in Europe.  So it might take several months before we see anything in the data. The pace of employment growth continues to be slow, and I didn’t hear any particularly interesting new news about labor markets this round.  I was going to stop there, but I just want to point out that a lot of people have mentioned already that they talked to businesspeople who say that they’re nervous about Europe and they’re not going to hire.  They’ve been saying they weren’t going to hire for some time.  So we’re already at the zero bound, it seems, for hiring—it’s hard for that to get worse. The financial reports from our Chicago market contacts seem roughly consistent with the financial stability memos.  Funding availability is increased for the better quality borrowers and market segments.  One contact noted having maybe a dozen bidders for CRE deals he was putting together, whereas, four or five months ago, investors would have laughed his proposals out of the room.  Most of these deals are on conservative terms for properties with stable cash flows.  New construction loans, in contrast, are very difficult to obtain.  We did hear a number of comments regarding some pullback on risk and leverage since May.  For example, some dealers are unwilling to buy for inventory in their marketmaking capacity, and some hedge funds are buying CDS protection and put options as a way of limiting downside risks.  However, on the plus side, obligations of nonfinancial firms were not particularly stressed in May. Turning to the international situation, the increasing emphasis on austerity programs in Europe presents some unique challenges for the U.S. outlook and policymaking.  I thought theinternational memos and risk scenarios were very helpful for thinking through that this time.  When you consider straight import–export multipliers, it’s hard to come up with major effects on U.S. growth.  But, at conferences I attended recently overseas, the European and other foreign central bankers I spoke with seemed pretty complacent about the prospects of demand from the U.S. providing important support for continued export growth worldwide.  I’d tell them it seems hard to imagine that the American consumer will return to its 15-year run of stimulating world growth, but their reaction was either puzzlement or denial of such prospects.  So I am concerned that foreign policymakers are underestimating the effects that their belt tightening will have on their domestic economies.  Of course, the larger risk would be a further deterioration in international financial markets, as the chart show and financial stability memos discussed.  But, for the moment, these are mostly just tail risks.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 208.
 MS. YELLEN.  That’s true.  Economic data releases since our April meeting have been consistent with the moderate recovery, but the turmoil in Europe with resulting deterioration in financial conditions during the intermeeting period pose substantial risks to economic growth and global financial stability going forward.  The timing could hardly be worse.  Monetary accommodation is stretched to the limit.  Fiscal policy is likely to turn more restrictive in many countries, and inflation is undesirably low and trending lower.  Like the Tealbook, I’ve lowered my projection for economic growth.  The most recent data suggest some slowdown in consumerspending, and the moderation evident in the aggregate data accords with reports I’m receiving from my business contacts.  Major retailers with whom we have spoken during the past month typically report that spending is flat or growing at only a very modest pace.  They hypothesize that the spending spurt that occurred earlier in the year reflected catch-up purchases by individuals who deferred buying discretionary items in 2009 due to uncertainty about their employment prospects.  With layoffs abating, those who are still employed apparently are less fearful about job loss. Looking ahead, both the deterioration in domestic financial conditions and the reduction in the outlook for foreign growth have caused me to trim my forecast for the second half of this year and next year.  I now expect real GDP to increase about 3½ percent this year and a touch under 4 percent next year.  The prospect of subpar growth is likely to make the labor market recovery even more agonizingly slow that I previously expected.  I now anticipate that the unemployment rate will end this year at about 9½ percent, declining only to 8½ percent at the end of 2011 and will take a couple of additional years to return to full employment.  As Bill Wascher emphasized, long-term unemployment has now risen from its pre-recession level of about 1 percent to over 4 percent, and, as of May, 46 percent of the unemployed had been without a job for at least 27 weeks.  This is an extremely disconcerting situation, one that translates into tremendous hardship for families and that has potentially serious adverse long-term consequences. Turning to inflation, the very low recent readings on core consumer price inflation are worrisome.  I expect core PCE prices to rise about ¾ percent this year and a little below 1 percent next year.  Both figures are a touch below my April forecasts, reflecting the greater slack in labor and product markets I now expect and the effects of the stronger dollar.  Laborcompensation growth remains anemic.  Indeed, my business contacts report no sign of labor cost pressures outside of health and unemployment insurance.  The economy’s substantial slack will continue to weigh on inflation, and the recent appreciation of the dollar should put some further downward pressure on prices.  Nonetheless, inflation expectations remain well anchored, which should put a floor on disinflation. Recent events in Europe have put to rest any thought I had that the risks to the outlook were diminishing to normal levels.  The very scary Tealbook simulation of the severe European sovereign debt crisis illustrates the scope of the potential downside dangers.  Another risk that concerns me, albeit a far less dramatic one, is that the underlying trend in productivity growth may be significantly stronger than either the Board staff or I have assumed.  The Tealbook forecast assumes that labor productivity growth will slow sharply from its recent rapid pace to a little above 1 percent this year and next.  This is well below the Board staff’s estimate of structural productivity growth of 2 percent, and it reflects some payback from the extraordinary productivity gains of 2009 and early this year resulting from the reversal of strains on workers—strains that will not prove sustainable. But such a productivity slowdown would represent a marked departure from the pattern of past recoveries.  Historically, labor productivity nearly always grows rapidly during the first two years of an expansion.  This is because measured productivity typically rises as firms increase the intensity with which they use capital and labor.  The sharply rising rate of capacity utilization expected over the next few years should, if anything, boost productivity growth, in contrast to the forecast in the Tealbook.  The prediction of slow productivity growth also appears inconsistent with what I have been hearing from my business contacts.  They tell me that recent productivity improvements, although born out of necessity, have become the new normal andreflect permanent changes in the way they do business.  To the extent that they’re right, the level of structural productivity may be significantly higher than assumed in the Tealbook, and productivity growth over the next few years may be higher as well.  Such a situation is illustrated by the jobless recovery alternative simulation in the Tealbook that assumes that productivity growth will be about 2½ percent this year and next, rather than 1 percent.  Of course, faster productivity growth is a good thing to the extent that it implies greater capacity to produce goods and services.  But the alternative simulation also shows that a stronger productivity trend would lead to significantly higher unemployment and lower inflation, outcomes that move us further away from our dual mandate goals. In summary, I still ascribe to the view that the economy is on a recovery path of moderate growth and very low inflation, but significant downside risks to the outlook have once again materialized and that implies that we should avoid altering policy in any way that could impede a fragile recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker acknowledges that economic data releases have been consistent with moderate recovery. However, they also highlight the risks to economic growth and global financial stability posed by the turmoil in Europe. They also mention the potential for subpar growth and a slow labor market recovery, as well as concerns about low inflation and the potential for higher unemployment and lower inflation if productivity growth is stronger than expected. Overall, the passage presents a mixed outlook with both positive and negative factors.

Passage number 212.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth District economy continues to expand at a steady, modest pace.  According to reports on our retail sales, spending is continuing to grow modestly, although our auto dealers are reporting some pretty strong increases in sales.  Our energy activity is expanding, and there has been a pretty significant oil play found in southeastern Wyoming that’s creating a little bit of activity—we’ll see how that develops as we go forward.  Obviously, commercial real estate remains weak around the District, although we’ve seen some stability on the residential side, that is, some less negative news. The manufacturing survey in our region shows continued expansion, but at a moderate pace.  I have reported to you in the past some activity in farmland, and that continues.  I will tell you that I’ve become a little more concerned—we  got a call from one of our contacts who had gotten a call from another part of the country asking if there were any real good deals around ”Wi-CHEE-tah,” Kansas.  Don, you and I know that is Wichita, Kansas.  When they do that, I get real worried about where they’re coming from. [Laughter]. On the whole, our District actually went into the recession a bit after the nation did, but it’s coming out at about the same pace.  So as I look at us and compare us to the nation, I’m pretty comfortable with the outlook.  We’ve had almost a year of growth, and I expect that to continue over the course of the rest of this year and, I hope, into 2011.  Thank you.

Passage number 214.
MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Ninth District continue to improve.  Earlier in 2010, I reported to you that the prevailing attitude was one of waiting to see whether recent increases in demand were sustainable.  There is much more confidence now that demand is back, especially among high-end consumers.  Our business contracts reported that they had enjoyed outstanding months in March and April, including a large company that specializes in temporary hiring.  However, there was some pullback in May.  Shipping out of our main port, Duluth, is proceeding at a rapid pace.  At the same time, inflationary pressures in the District seem minimal.  Firms report only modest or limited movements in import prices. In terms of the national economy, my point forecast has changed little since April.  I expect GDP to grow at roughly 3½ percent over the next two years and inflation to remain low—around 1 percent during the coming year—but then to bump up to average around 2 percent in 2011 and 2012.  However, the level of uncertainty around my forecast has increased since the last FOMC meeting.  In terms of output, as the Tealbook points out, a European financial crisis could adversely affect growth outcomes in the United States.  Along those lines, I was glad to see reports of a planned stress test of the large European financial institutions.  I believe that this exercise will do much to reduce the likelihood and severity of a European financial crisis if the exercise is performed in an appropriate fashion. In terms of inflation, I remain concerned about the upside risks associated with increases in the United States debt and deficit.  But the recent low realizations of inflation have also led me to be concerned about downside risk.  As is conventional, the forecast in Tealbook. Book A, assumes that the FOMC responds to undesirably low realizations of inflation by keeping the fed funds rate at zero for an even longer period of time.Both in our models and in the data, inflation and interest rates are actually tightly positively related over the longer run.  So the Tealbook’s policy rule has the potential to generate a multiyear deflation, or liquidity trap, in which inflation is low or even negative for many years and the fed funds rate is stuck at zero.  This idea that conventional monetary policy can generate self-fulfilling inflations at the zero lower bound goes back to the work of Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe about a decade ago.  President Bullard referred specifically to this risk in the two-headed dragon speech that he gave to the AEA in early 2009.  As he pointed out there, the history of Japan since the 1990s indicates that this possibility may be more than a purely theoretical one.  Now, at this point, these are just risks, and I think these risks seem to be under control, as longer-term inflationary expectations basically remain in a range consist with our mandate. In May, national unemployment was 9.7 percent, and private sector employment growth was small.  Like that of the Tealbook, my outlook for national employment/unemployment is bleak.  I do not see unemployment falling below 8 percent until after the end of 2011.  Undoubtedly, some amount of unemployment corresponds to the existence of an output gap created by wage and price rigidities.  However, I see at least two other important sources of high unemployment.  Small businesses are typically an important source of job growth during recoveries, but limitations of their access to bank credit are constraining their ability to create jobs.  In addition, businesses remain highly uncertain about the ultimate impact of health care reform and taxation on employee costs. To summarize, over the next two years I anticipate a moderate recovery in output along with low but positive inflation.  The European situation and the recent near-zero realizations of inflation have generated more uncertainty in my outlook.  Unemployment is likely to beunacceptably high for at least two to three years.  My assessment of the root causes of unemployment implies that it may well continue to be high as the output gap associated with price and wage rigidities closes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 216.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The flow of data since the last meeting has been mixed at best, and, like the Tealbook and most forecasters, we’ve marked down our outlook for real activity a bit.  But the changes in our projections haven’t been as quite substantial as the Tealbook’s.  The case for a large slowdown in consumption—to below 3 percent for the rest of this year and barely over 3 percent next year—appears to lean heavily on the effects of credit constraints.  My sense is that fluctuations in the degree to which consumers or small businesses feel credit constrained is driven predominantly by fluctuations in their own prospects rather than by variations in bank capital or other supply-side factors right now.  So, while European developments have certainly heightened real and financial uncertainty and should not be taken lightly, it doesn’t seem that likely to me that these developments will impinge much on the gradual improvement in credit conditions for U.S. households that seems to be under way. Because, in my outlook, consumption growth doesn’t slow quite as much as in the Tealbook, the accelerator mechanism implies stronger business investment growth.  In addition, I think replacing and upgrading equipment in IT systems seems to be playing a very important role—investments driven by depreciation rather than by output, in a sense.  So I see decent prospects for firms returning to investment plans that were put on hold before the recession. Finally, I see a faster return of inflation to a trend between 1½ and 2 percent.  Expectations have remained remarkably stable during the recession, despite the weighty burdenof a large output gap.  If the recovery continues and becomes better established, I think expected trend inflation will exert a more powerful force on overall and core inflation. My guarded optimism on the national economy is buttressed by the largely favorable information we’ve received lately about the Fifth District.  Our manufacturing survey’s overall index was down just slightly in June—from 26 to 23, still a very strong positive reading—and we’ve received reports from manufacturers in a wide array of sectors in the Fifth District noting rising orders, and port activity has been on a very distinct rise.  Our services survey remained in positive territory as well, although retail remains a bit soft, and respondents to all of our surveys appear to be fairly upbeat on balance about the next six months.  Government contractors in the D.C. area are showing particular strength—you can take that as a good sign or a bad sign, it’s up to you.  We’ve received anecdotal reports from around the District that are positive, including positive comments about labor markets.  And, as summer gets under way, tourist numbers on the Carolina coast are up year over year.  Most of the less sunny reports we’ve received involve commercial real estate in our District, which isn’t doing so hot. Overall the picture that emerges from the District is of broadening areas of positive momentum with some lingering weak patches.  So my bottom line is that the recovery is likely to be sustained at about its current pace, even though the downside risks have increased somewhat.  Thank you.

The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is presenting his analysis and outlook on the economy, highlighting both positive and negative factors.

Passage number 221.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In what I trust really is my final FOMC meeting [laughter], I find myself situated pretty much in the central tendency of the Committee’s projections and in agreement with the general tone and assessment I’ve heard around the tableyesterday and today.  The incoming data continue to be consistent with moderate expansion in the 3 to 4 percent range that we’ve averaged since the middle of 2009.  There are no real signs of substantial strengthening or weakening from that pace, and the story of private final demand taking over from the inventory cycle and fiscal impetus still appears to be intact in the most recent data. The gradual pace of recovery from the very deep recession is quite striking, given the degree of fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been applied.  I think that, to date, there’s no sign that the impediments to more rapid growth that we’ve been citing over the past months and quarters are abating any faster than we had been expecting.  Confidence is rising slowly from a low level.  Uncertainty about sales and about tax and regulatory environment are holding back business spending.  Balance sheet repair in the household sector is dampening borrowing and spending.  Bank credit continues to be extraordinarily weak.  While bank credit supply is no longer tightening, it is likely to ease slowly as bank capital is rebuilt, loan losses top out, and banks begin to adapt to those much more stringent capital and liquidity requirements Bill was just talking about.  The housing market continues to face an overhang of available supply.  But with the gradual easing in these restraints, I have economic growth picking up to 4½ percent by 2012 with a 7¼ percent unemployment rate at the end of that year.  Regarding inflation, substantial margins of slack and associated highly competitive conditions in labor and product markets have meant that, even as the economy has begun to recover, inflation has continued to decline, with deceleration across a broad array of categories. As many of you have remarked, the important change over the intermeeting period is the deteriorating situation in Europe.  In response, I marked down my expected GDP growth alittle—not as much as the staff did—and  raised my projection of the path of the unemployment rate, which now falls even more slowly than it did in my April projection. Importantly, the intermeeting developments led me, like many of you, to perceive greater uncertainty and downside risks even to this very gradual upturn in activity.  I think we’ve had a demonstration that financial markets remain very volatile and sensitive, with a bias toward rapid and marked flight from risk.  I think this partly reflects fresh memories of the fall of 2008.  We’ve also seen a demonstration that, in an integrated economic and financial environment, we are vulnerable to problems abroad.  In this respect, I differ a bit from President Bullard’s analysis that they might, in some sense, benefit us.  I think we’re especially vulnerable and tend to be more impacted by negative shocks from abroad because the flight to safety raises the dollar exchange rate, but it hasn’t really damped the cost of capital for many private borrowers outside the mortgage market—corporations are paying more, LIBOR goes up, and a lot of rates on bank loans go up.  So the weaker outlook and greater uncertainty have increased the cost of capital and appreciated the dollar.  And, Jim, I remember that that’s what happened in the fall of 1998—I don’t recall that we benefited from the Asian crisis; we actually had to ease policy a bit when that happened.  In addition, pressures for fiscal consolidation have increased globally, with greater near-term downside implications for activity.  And, most dangerous, as a number of you, the Vice Chairman, in particular, have pointed out, are the risks of a spillover from sovereign risk to the banking sector in Europe and the rather substantial exposure of U.S. lenders, including money market funds, to those banks.  There have been some constructive steps in the past few days, including a commitment to transparent stress tests in Europe—provided that they’re carried out, as President Kocherlakota said, in a reasonable way—and a more flexible yuan, which, I think, is a positive development.  So my forecast is based on the Europeans finding a waythrough this situation that maintains stability and rebuilds confidence, but the vulnerabilities all seem tilted in one direction. Like many of you, I also marked down my inflation forecasts based on incoming data confirming a downward trend to core, lower energy prices that will feed through to headline inflation, the rise in the dollar and its effect on import prices, and slightly greater slack in my forecast.  I have assumed that expectations remain anchored, but I suspect I’m putting a little more emphasis on slack than some other participants, because my inflation forecasts are at the lower end of or even a smidge below the central tendencies, while my activity forecast is at the upper end of the central tendencies.  This weight on slack seems consistent with the marked deceleration in compensation inflation on balance over the past year, even as inflation expectations remain anchored.  I had headline inflation staying at about 1 percent for the next three years. I see downside risks on the inflation front as well.  The main risk is that expectations will begin to adjust down after what will be several years—three, four years—of very low headline inflation, if I’m right.  An unanchoring of inflation expectations on the downside would threaten a potentially adverse dynamic of rising real interest rates and declining inflation at levels well below the Committee members’ long-term objectives. So, like most of you, I see a long, slow climb out of a very deep hole, with inflation running well below our objectives for a number of years and downside risks around that forecast.  We will be falling well short of our dual mandate for the foreseeable future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 MS. DUKE.  And that was if the courier did a good job on his side. In addition, there’s complete reliance on vendors to make the changes that are needed for compliance.  Community banks view their advantage as the ability to customize products, while larger bankers stay inside the box, and the new regulations just seemed to tighten the box.  One fourth generation CEO of a $50 million family-owned bank said she described it to her father as trying to make it on an 80-acre family farm—just not enough scale or resources.In summary, we seem to be beyond the point where credit quality concerns will restrict recovery, but uncertainty about regulation and capital requirements is taking its place.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 229.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you.  For me, the intermeeting period has largely been a tale of the tail.  A look at real economic data suggests some slowing, though not a sharp break with the pattern of recovery whose pace continues to be limited by the housing problems and balance sheet repairs that are the legacy of the financial crisis.  But as many of you have already suggested, a glance at financial indicators and conversations with market participants tell a different story, one of sharply renewed vulnerabilities and an associated flight to quality arising directly from the debt problems of the euro zone periphery and, more generally, from the long-term fiscal predicaments of many in the group of countries that we’ve traditionally called the advanced economies. Nonfinancial data over the last seven weeks are largely consistent with what has become a reasonably well established but not particularly robust recovery.  As noted in the staff briefing, consumer spending, manufacturing, and investment in equipment and software remain solid.  But other indicators are not so favorable, and it seems less clear that self-sustaining economic activity will fully replace the waning effects of stimulus and inventory replenishment.  As evidenced by releases of the last two mornings, housing captures the broader picture well, both in that we do not see a run of more than a few good data points before less encouraging reports appear and in that there has been less good news lately. With respect to employment, there is, to be sure, still some reason to be hopeful about the jobs picture, notably increases in hours worked and some preliminary information suggestingthat any structural unemployment by-products of the recession may be limited.  But we’ve had hopeful signs for some time now, and they’ve translated into decent private sector job growth in only two months thus far.  Looking at projections that Bill distributed yesterday, the FOMC as a whole expects that unemployment two and a half years from now will still be a couple of percentage points above what we consider the long-run trend. Now to the tail:  Euro zone periphery problems have created obvious stresses, as revealed most palpably in the financial data presented by Nellie yesterday.  The uncertainty that results has been increased by continued disjointed policy response and communication problems among European policymakers.  Owing to the awkward structure of its economic policymaking, this awkwardness, I think, has been reflected in both the continued lack of elaboration on some particulars of how the SPV will function and, as many of you have noted, in continuing and recurring questions surrounding the bank stress test exercise.  A number of observers here and in Europe note that each time European policymakers take a leap ahead of the curve, they get bogged down in the challenges of coordinating the implementation of their initiatives, and they risk falling behind that curve once again.  It’s possible to muddle through sovereign debt and banking sector problems, but history suggests that a failure to get ahead of these problems will often lead to grief. The uncertainties associated with the immediate risks of the sovereign debt and associated banking problems are bad enough.  Then we have the view, which I’ve heard from a number of market participants, that virtually any policy chosen in Europe will be a bad one.  Credible fiscal consolidation will be good for reassuring the financial system but, quite possibly, bad for economic growth.  Failure to move forward on credible fiscal consolidation may be helpful in the short term but will compound the medium-term problems and, quite possibly, leadto a steepening of yield curves sooner rather than later.  Finding the right balance and timing of policies will obviously be a challenge, not to mention the coordination difficulties. In terms of my own expectations, starting with my modal expectation, the effect of the euro zone problems on risk aversion, exports, and equity values will be only partially offset by lower Treasury rates and commodity prices.  This expectation led me to pare somewhat my projections for GDP growth in the remainder of this year and 2011, though not as much as the Tealbook, and that’s in part because I never expected growth as high as the Greenbook had foreseen before its recent change of hue.  My modal forecast is not too optimistic to begin with.  Add to that the tail risk of a financial event in Europe—and I think we can have a disruptive financial event that falls short of a full-blown crisis—and we see at least some potential for renewed asset value and credit strains in the United States with a resulting significant negative effect on economic performance.  So here’s hoping the tail doesn’t wag the dog.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there are conflicting views and uncertainties surrounding the euro zone debt problems and the appropriate policies to address them. They mention the different perspectives on fiscal consolidation and the potential negative effects on economic growth. Additionally, the speaker expresses their own concerns about the impact of these problems on risk aversion, exports, and equity values, and the potential for a disruptive financial event in the United States.


Passage number 230.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, and thanks to everyone.  Let me make a stab at trying to summarize the conversation around the table.  Intermeeting data were generally mixed, and financial conditions became less supportive, largely as a result of uncertainties about European sovereign debt and the ramifications of a possible default on the European periphery.  Most participants, however, continued to expect a moderate recovery into next year, although downside risks to growth have increased somewhat.  The labor market is recovering, but painfully slowly, reflecting the moderate pace of output growth.  The inventory correction is no longer providing significant support to the recovery, and, although private final demands seems to have picked up the baton, the strength and certain components of final demand may prove transitory.  Inflation remains low and trending down.  Inflation expectations appear stable, andcommodity prices are moderating.  Medium-term risks to inflation, to both the upside and the downside, remain, although, on net, economic developments and incoming data led inflation risk to shift toward the downside over the intermeeting period. Household spending has been moderately strong, supported by income growth and a modest improvement in confidence.  However, recent reports are mixed, and continued labor market weakness could weigh on confidence, income, and spending going forward.  Declines in equity and housing wealth are another potential drag on consumption growth. In the labor market, data on new hires and UI claims were disappointing, except for the temporary boost provided by Census hiring.  Employers thus far have added hours more through increases in workweeks and overtime than by adding employees.  Possibly these increases in hours may lead to more hiring in the near future, as suggested by increases in temp hiring.  But employer pensiveness about the economic and policy environment is also likely playing a role in the slow hiring pace.  The staff predicts low productivity growth from here, but productivity growth more in line with recent expansions, though good in the long run, could translate into weaker, short-term employment gains.  Long-term unemployment represents a serious problem with potential longer-term implications for skills, social networks, and labor market attachment. Housing demand has been up in some areas but looks to be weaker in the near term, with starts and sales down, in part reflecting a withdrawal of federal tax credits for homebuyers as well as tight credit.  Home prices are flat to down with the overhang of available supply a drag on prices in many localities.  Mortgage modification programs have not had as much success as hoped.  Nonresidential construction remains at low levels, and banks’ commercial real estate problems may worsen with the large volume of loans coming due in the near term.  However, there have been indications of stabilization in commercial real estate fundamentals in prices.Moreover, funding is available for stronger CRE deals on conservative terms, and some grounds for optimism on CRE performance exist. In financial markets, concerns about Europe and perhaps about financial regulatory reform, new capital standards, and accounting changes have increased jitteriness and reduced investors’ appetite for risk.  Correlations across asset classes are high.  Lower stock prices, the stronger dollar, and somewhat tighter corporate credit are negatives for U.S. economic growth, although lower oil prices and lower Treasury yields are a partial offset.  The European bank stress test may help the situation.  However, the European situation remains a tail risk, albeit a low probability one.  Conditions have improved recently, as confidence that Europe will muddle through has increased.  Credit losses and delinquencies at banks may have peaked, and many banks are looking to make loans again, though, from their perspective, the supply of creditworthy borrowers appears very limited.  Bank profits have been better recently but could well slow and face a number of downside risks, including the effects of the financial reform package. In the nonfinancial sector, industrial production has continued to expand.  The prospects for foreign demand weakened over the intermeeting period because of a weaker Europe and a weaker euro, and net exports are not expected to provide much of an impetus to U.S. economic growth.  Firms’ investments are focused on replacement and maintenance.  With considerable uncertainty, they have limited interest in investing for expansion.  Equipment and software investment, though recently strong, seems likely to slow.  Firms are cautious, concerned about random refereeing by policymakers, and consequently are focusing on blocking and tackling.

Passage number 231.
 MR. FISHER.  Nagurski.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not contain any points of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions "MR. FISHER" and "Nagurski" without providing any context or indication of disagreement.


Passage number 232.
 MR. STOCKTON.5  The housing data this morning were rather bleak.  We received the report on new home sales, and it looks as if President Rosengren’s turtle not only pulled in its head but also fell off the log.  Sales fell about 32 percent to 300,000 units.  We had expected, obviously, some decline, because we were anticipating a payback, but not one as steep as this.  I think it probably suggests more of what we’d seen earlier this spring:  The strength in sales and even the small uptick in starts were probably related to the tax credit.  We had assumed that we would be marking down our forecast for sales and starts a bit going forward, taking some signal from that. The good news, if you can put it that way, is that this sector is small enough now that a 30 percent decline is not a whole lot of GDP.  In fact, if anything, we’d probably be looking at  5 The materials used by Mr. Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).less than 0.1 percentage point out of our third quarter forecast from those lower sales, so it isn’t a whole lot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating facts and providing their analysis and interpretation of the data.


Passage number 233.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  Before we take a break, perhaps Brian would go ahead and give us the introduction to the policy go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 234.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Brian.  Let me call attention to that last point.  As written, the directive would authorize the Desk to undertake the coupon swaps we discussed yesterday, and the current plan would be for those to take place before release of the minutes for this meeting.  So it would be treated as a technical change that is announced by the Desk.  An alternative would be to ask the Desk to delay until after the minutes are released.  If you have a view on that and would like to say something about it, then you can just include that in your policy go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 235.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Can I ask a technical question about the dollar rolls and the swaps.  How many other issues are pending in that same category. How big is the backlog, in some sense, of this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 236.
  Are we going to anticipate having to face this every ten days or every two weeks, or— MR. SACK.  The main issue is clearly in the 5.5s that we discussed, with the $9 billion of unsettled transactions.  I think we will see how things go once we start, but we would anticipateswapping out of those perhaps over a two-month period, so there would be two settlement cycles.  In terms of other coupons, there are other unsettled trades, particularly in the 5 percent coupons.  At this time, we don’t anticipate having to use coupon swaps to settle those.  As noted yesterday, there is still some production in those coupons, and there are other factors that we think will keep their supply available.  But we’ll see, and if we do decide that we need to do swaps in those other coupons, I would inform the Committee before moving forward with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information and potential scenarios.


Passage number 237.
 MR. PLOSSER.  So what’s the size of the 5s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks for information about the size of the 5s, without any disagreement or opposing views.


Passage number 238.
 MR. SACK.  There’s about $6 billion of unsettled transactions right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement is a factual statement about the amount of unsettled transactions, and there is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 239.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. Mr. Plosser is merely expressing gratitude for something, possibly in response to a previous statement or question.


Passage number 240.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Questions for Brian.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple statement requesting questions for Brian from President Fisher.


Passage number 241.
 MR. FISHER.  You asked a question, Mr. Chairman, about timing.  I have no problem with the coupon swaps.  We are talking about, at least initially, $9 billion out of $1.25 trillion.  The question of timing, it seems to me, relates to the first two sentences in the directive, because it basically says what we’re going to say in our statement.  I would just ask, if we’re going to give the Desk a directive—which I support—whether we need to put those first two sentences in there.  We’re dealing with a settlement issue.  Do the first two sentences take away or pre-announce, of course, what we all know we are going to announce, but before we issue the statement.  Is it necessary to have those first two sentences in there.  We’re dealing with a settlement issue—that’s the point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply questioning whether the first two sentences in the directive are necessary and if they might pre-announce the announcement before it is formally issued.


Passage number 242.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are we talking about the first two sentences of the directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not presenting any contention or disagreement. It is merely mentioning the topic of discussion without expressing any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 243.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The response "Yes, sir" indicates agreement.


Passage number 244.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  When is the directive released.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply asks the question "When is the directive released." There are no conflicting opinions or arguments presented in the passage.


Passage number 245.
MR. MADIGAN.  With the minutes, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Madigan, is simply requesting the minutes from the Chairman.


Passage number 246.
 MR. FISHER.  Oh, I’m sorry.  I thought you were asking whether we should issue the directive before that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a straightforward statement clarifying a misunderstanding.


Passage number 247.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question is whether the Desk should issue a press release explaining the action they’re going to take, not the directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states what the question is without any hint of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 248.
 MR. FISHER.  Okay.  I apologize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is apologizing, indicating a recognition of their mistake or fault.


Passage number 249.
 MR. SACK.  And the release wouldn’t list the directive or even refer to the directive, but the current directive that the public is aware of doesn’t allow for coupon swaps.  So there is that degree of front-running the directive that will come out in the minutes, because it could lead to a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the current directive and how it could potentially lead to a question.


Passage number 250.
 MR. FISHER.  Obviously, the purpose is to accomplish what we want to accomplish without any implications about the change of policy.  This is to accomplish a specific objective.  I misunderstood your point, Mr. Chairman.  I apologize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher acknowledges that he misunderstood the point made by the Chairman and apologizes for his previous misunderstanding.


Passage number 251.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No problem.  Further questions for Brian.  Anyone.  [No response.]  Okay.  If not, since it is 10:30, let’s take a break for 20 minutes, and we’ll come back and do the policy go-round.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement and suggests taking a break before continuing with the discussion.


Passage number 252.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s recommence, and we’ll begin with the policy go-round.  President Rosengren, you’re first on the list.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply providing a suggestion to resume the meeting and begin a specific discussion topic, with a specific person being mentioned as the first to speak.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 253.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The Tealbook has a higher unemployment rate at the end of 2010 and 2011 than at our previous meeting.  It also has a lower core inflation rate at the end of 2010 and 2011 than at our previous meeting.  This forecast is very limited improvement in the very large miss on our unemployment mandate,and we move further away from reaching a goal of 2 percent inflation.  My own forecast has moved in the same direction.  As a result, I view any tightening through language or asset sales as moving in the wrong direction.  Like the staff, I do not see much likelihood that we should tighten policy in 2010 or 2011. I would note that key phrases in alternative A provide a description of the outlook and its relation to our goals that seems better aligned with the staff forecast and with my own outlook.  In particular, alternative A highlights the fact that the outlook has weakened somewhat, and emphasizes that inflation is likely to remain below, and maybe well below, rates consistent with our dual mandate.  Should we experience further weakness and disinflation, we may want to move to language closer to that expressed in alternative A at future meetings.  In fact, I am concerned that we should be doing more contingency planning with a possibility that deflation or financial contagion from Europe could move from the risk to the outcome column.  While we were quite innovative during the financial crisis, should these risks become a reality, our creativity may once again be tested.  In terms of the coupon swaps, I view it as a technical matter.  As a result, I think making an announcement of a technical matter is fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker supports alternative B, while also expressing concerns about tightening policy and suggesting that alternative A may be more aligned with their outlook and the staff forecast.


Passage number 254.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude towards someone named President Yellen.


Passage number 255.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B and approval of the coupon swap as proposed by the staff.  The economy is operating far below maximum sustainable employment, and inflation is undesirably low—conditions that are likely to persist for several years.  Indeed, the outlook has deteriorated since our April meeting, and the time for policy tightening has, if anything, moved further off.  At this point, I see the risks associated with tightening policy prematurely as extremely high, owing to the zero bound on interest rates and the fact that inflation is already so low.  This is not merely a theoretical point.  As highlighted bythe Board staff analysis, the fallout from Europe poses significant risk for the U.S. economy, and we need monetary policy to be as well-positioned as possible if this or other major downside risks materialize.  I strongly support maintaining the “extended period” language.  It continues to serve us well in shaping market expectations of future policy, especially as market participants have consistently demonstrated that they understand its conditionality. A case can be made for further accommodation as in A, but I would not argue for it now.  I agree that we should think carefully, though, about what we will do if the outlook deteriorates.  That said, I agree with you that the bar for further steps should be reasonably high.  We must be attentive, too, to the possibility that an extended period of near-zero rates could lead to the emergence of dangerous financial imbalances.  It remains to my mind unclear just how important low short-term rates, as opposed to other factors, were in sowing the seeds of the financial crisis; but recognizing and evaluating financial risks and vulnerabilities should be at the center of our efforts to ramp up macro prudential surveillance.  So far, as the financial stability staff memos document, there are no signs of such excessive leverage or speculation.  In fact, over the intermeeting period, the appetite for risk has retreated in reaction to events in Europe.  So this leaves me comfortable with our current policy stance and alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses support for alternative B and maintaining the current policy stance, while also acknowledging the need to monitor the possibility of further accommodation or financial imbalances.


Passage number 256.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Lacker.


Passage number 257.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At this meeting, I’m willing to support alternative B.  The modest increase in downside risk since the last meeting makes this an inopportune time to make any significant adjustments in our policy rate or our language.  I continue to believe we’re going to need to tighten earlier than the Tealbook assumes.  I think the likely modal outcome is that these downside risks will dissipate, and the economy will proceedto recover, and we’ll get to a point months down the road where the economy looks about the way that we forecasted it would back in March. I continue to believe that normalizing our balance sheet is an independent policy imperative that we should be discussing, and I don’t think it needs to wait until we raise rates.  As I said yesterday, I think the composition and size of our balance sheet are two different things—there’s no reason we can’t vary them independently.  I don’t think we’ve given that option enough attention in our discussion, so I support President Hoenig’s letter urging more discussion and analysis of scenarios involving asset sales.  Everything the staff has presented to us, as I said yesterday, involving asset sales involved a concomitant variation in the size of our balance sheet. There was some discussion yesterday about the effect of reserves, rather than our assets, on the economy.  I don’t see, from observations on what we’ve done so far, how you disentangle the effect of our asset purchases from the effect of the reserves we have put in the economy.  If there’s a way to identify it, I’d be really interested in seeing it, but I certainly haven’t seen it in any staff analysis.  The general presumption is that there are general equilibrium effects running around. I’ll point out—and I sort of made this pitch before—that, to the extent that some theories about the effects of our asset purchases rely on market segmentation, that’s something that, in principle, is amenable to direct observation and verification:  We should be able to document that these institutions face this impediment from participating in that market as opposed to this market.  Surely the facts about that are out there, and relying on indirect econometric evidence alone seems weak to me.  This is just by way of a suggestion for future staff research.I was questioned as to the benefits of reducing our mortgage-backed security holdings rapidly.  I’ve admitted before that, for me, the benefit is chiefly in the nature of political economy.  If there are some political economy considerations on the other side that would make us resist moving to all Treasuries in an expeditious way, I’d be interested in hearing about them.  But I don’t know of any. Again, I support further study of asset sales and a program as suggested by President Hoenig.  I don’t see why, if we adopt a program like that, we can’t independently vary our Treasury holdings in the natural way, either to maintain the current size of the reserve balances in the system and our assets or to have them trace out a path higher than they would trace out if we just sold the assets.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is expressing their own beliefs and opinions, but there is no direct disagreement or contention with any other individual in the passage.


Passage number 258.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’d just make the observation, without knowing exactly which way it cuts, that conversations with foreign holders of U.S. securities suggest that for some reason, which I don’t understand, they believe Treasury purchases to be much more inflationary than MBS purchases.  I understand there’s no theoretical basis for this distinction, but somehow it’s a very strongly held view—just for what it’s worth.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply sharing their observation that foreign holders of U.S. securities believe Treasury purchases to be more inflationary than MBS purchases, even though there is no theoretical basis for this belief.


Passage number 259.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B.  I agree with some of the suggestions around the table that we need to be thinking about contingency planning of various kinds.  On the one hand, things could surely go better than we are currently expecting, and we have to have a strategy in place not just about what we’re going to do, but also about how we plan to communicate what we’re going to do.  For example, the Chairman suggested yesterday we might start talking about doing sales in six months, with an interest rate hike somewhere in between—that might be one possibility.  But I think we have to be formulatingplans now for these contingencies, because it could well be that in six months or nine months we’ll be surprised on the upside and have to think that through. At the same time, I think we have to be thinking about what we would do in response to adverse shocks, as President Yellen and President Rosengren have suggested.  Should we go out and buy more assets.  My guess is that that’s not going to be the best thing to do right now.  I think this was an effective strategy in late 2008 and early 2009, because markets were much more dysfunctional than they are now.  When markets are functioning well, you don’t have the kind of segmentation necessary for a change in the composition of assets to have huge effects on market prices.  And you’re not going to be able to have a huge stimulus effect as a result.  I think the correct thing—although we have to think more about this—would be to try to commit as much as possible to language like the “extended period” language.  For example, the proposal in alternative A says “will” instead of “likely” to warrant, which basically commits us to being slower to tighten—in other words, our best response to adverse shocks would be trying to stretch out the zero as long as we can. A much more difficult problem, is the situation where deflationary expectations start to become hardened—a deflationary trap— as I discussed in the economic go-around.  My own assessment of the literature and my own thinking about this lead me to believe that we, the monetary policymakers, have very limited tools at our disposal in this situation.  I think it would be great to have staff research on this, because it’s a very challenging problem.  Without a lot of monetary policy tools at our disposal, we would have to hope for a sufficient degree of fiscal irresponsibility from the Congress [laughter].  The Japanese have tried the fiscal approach, and it has not been successful for them.  So I think it would be a very challenging problem if we got to that stage.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude to Governor Kohn.


Passage number 262.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m in favor of alternative B.  I don’t think we’re any closer to tightening than we were two months ago.  The downward revision to the outlook has pushed our tightening off by at least a couple months, so I think the “extended period” is still appropriate, and I fear the “extended period” is going to be appropriate for an extended period.  As I noted at the end of my previous presentation, the path for the outlook is really unsatisfactory, and if the nominal funds rate were above zero, I would be advocating that we reduce it.  President Fisher, I think you’re right that a lot of the problems in the labor market are structural, such as education, etc., but there is a demand deficiency that has produced a substantial proportion of that unemployment, though by no means all of it.  And I think that, consistent with our dual mandate and without sacrificing the price stability goal at all, if we could make demand stronger, we would be fulfilling our responsibilities under the law.  But I agree—now that we’re at zero, it’s difficult.The hurdle for doing something extra is higher than the hurdle for just reducing the funds rate, given the uncertainties and the possibilities of adverse feedbacks.  I completely support your suggestion, Mr. Chairman, that we should be looking at that contingency and the various things we might do if circumstances suggest that more stimulus, greater impetus to demand, from the monetary authority is required.  Along those lines, President Kocherlakota talked about forward guidance.  That was on my list, too.  For example, are there things we could say that would change market expectations about when we will tighten that would lower long-term interest rates.  The Vice Chairman talked about not reducing our portfolio of MBS any more—that would be one thing.  Getting back into buying assets would be something else, although it has the negatives that you talked about.  And one instrument no one has talked about is the interest on excess reserves.  It’s not totally clear to me, if the situation were weakening, why that should be 25 basis points.  I think we put it there because we were worried about things like the money market funds and market functioning of one sort or another.  But, if we get to the point where we think easing is necessary, then I would reduce that all the way to zero.  I don’t see why not—Brian Sack might have a reason why not, but right now I don’t see it.  I think it would be a powerful signal of the Committee’s intentions and of our concern, so I would add that to the list that everyone has put forward of the contingency plans we ought to look at.  The fact that we’re having this conversation just reinforces my predilection, as I said yesterday, not to announce or do anything with sales or redemptions that could actually be a tightening or even be perceived as a tightening.  This is not the right time to do that.  And I’m not quite there, President Lacker, regarding separating totally the level of our portfolio from the composition of our portfolio.  I think the composition of the portfolio had a lot to do with the effects we did have on the market, and I’m not sure we could change that composition withouthaving some tightening effect.  It would depend on the type of changes we’re talking about.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. President Hoenig is expressing gratitude and thanking someone.


Passage number 265.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It’s interesting that we’re ending about a year’s worth of economic growth.  The recovery, of course, has gone through various phases, as President Fisher and others have noted, and the data have been mixed throughout.  Accordingly there has always been a degree of uncertainty with us.  I’ve been at this table many times in the past where uncertainty has caused us to wait.  Waiting is always attractive—certainly, I’m attracted to it, as well.  I recall discussions earlier in this last decade about concerns of deflation, uncertainties regarding world events, just as we’re discussing here.  There’s always a good reason, and I don’t dispute that.  I, too, worry about employment.  Jobless recoveries seem to be becoming the norm, and the adjustments seem harsher.  But my bottom line is that our dual mandate is a long-run mandate, and we need to go oh so carefully now to become less accommodative, because otherwise we may face the risk of adverse long-term consequences. My view is that the situation we’re coming out of was, in part at least and perhaps significantly, related to a period in which we kept rates very low in this world of uncertainty.  So, what is it we have here.  We have an outlook.  There are tail risks; I recognize that.  And we tend to focus on those tail risks—they scare us to death, but that’s what we tend to do.  However, the economy is growing, and the outlook suggests further growth.  That’s what we’ve all said—notrobust economic growth, but further growth.  Inflation is modest, but our actions have effects on resource flows as well, imbalances, and long-term stability, some of which President Bullard referred to.  Europe is a concern, and we need to keep our eye on it and be prepared to act, of course.  But it should not drive our decisions today.  Asia is actually stronger and is a positive factor that we ought to take into consideration. So I think it’s very important that we take this “extended period” language out, that we open up the possibility of selling assets as the economy evolves.  Taking the language out doesn’t mean we increase the funds rate.  I know it may have an implied tightening effect, but I think, with the right explanation, that opening up our options is something we have to think about very carefully.  As I said at the last meeting, we ought to begin to talk about a strategy going forward.  Yes, that would take away this very significant accommodation.  I believe there are consequences to maintaining the accommodating, and that’s my major concern.  Thank you very much.

Passage number 267.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the policy of alternative B and most of the language.  I do want to point out a slight concern—it may not amount to much.  In the first paragraph of alternative B, it reads that, “Economic activity has continued to strengthen,” and I wonder whether there will be some inconsistency in the interpretation of the minutes with that word “strengthen.”  One slight change could be to say that “the economic recovery continues to proceed,” which avoids the risk that people will think there was an inconsistency between the statement and the minutes.  I think it’s particularly important at this juncture that the statement and the minutes align well, because the market is, in all likelihood,going to react to the minutes.  The results of the forecast, as well as the tone of the meeting, could evoke quite a response, and it’s important that we make sure there’s consistency. I favor the approval of the coupon swaps and the inclusion of it in the directive as proposed. And, finally, I’d propose that we delay the statement by half an hour and cite the World Cup as our excuse.   I think this will add to the prestige of the Fed [laughter] and will, on a global basis, add to the credibility of our institution and have very positive effects on the efficacy of monetary policy going forward.  Let the transcript read that I’m kidding.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lockhart expresses support for alternative B and most of the language used. He raises a slight concern about the interpretation of the word "strengthen" in the first paragraph but suggests a minor change to address it. He also expresses support for coupon swaps and proposes a delay in the statement, but it is presented as a lighthearted suggestion.


Passage number 268.

Passage number 269.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Despite the talk around the table, I think the modal forecast for most of us is that a sustained, modest recovery is continuing, although the forecasts have been tempered ever so slightly—not substantially at this point.  There clearly are upside and downside risks to that forecast.  In my own case, as I mentioned yesterday, at the last meeting I did see the risks tilted to the upside, because I felt that the recovery was proceeding and because historical correlations suggested that it ought to be stronger than we were seeing.  I now treat them as balanced, so I changed the balance of risks.  But I don’t think that’s a cause for changing policy at this point. I’m actually quite worried.  Several others have touched on this, and President Lockhart just alluded to this—part of our job is thinking about the what-ifs.  What-ifs can almost paralyze you in making policy decisions.  I think we have to be very careful to resist allowing that paralysis to set in.  Given the nature of the discussion around the table, I’m also somewhat concerned that the minutes not show a terribly bleak picture.  Considering that we haven’tchanged our forecast that much, painting a bleak picture of the uncertainty and risks around Europe and the euro zone could actually be detrimental to our cause and create uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the economy as a whole.  So I think we have to be careful not to talk only about the downside risks and the problems that might happen, but rather to focus on what our forecasts in fact do say.  And, speaking of forecasts, I’d like to reinforce President Bullard’s point about appropriate monetary policy under the assumptions.  Certainly, in my own forecast, while I have inflation contained, I probably have a very different forecast of the underlying interest rate and appropriate policy than many others might have around the table.  So I think we need to be careful about that. I also share President Lacker’s view about the composition of our balance sheet—I think our MBS holdings present important political risks to us going forward.  I think the longer we maintain large holdings of those, the more we reinforce the expectation that that’s the appropriate role of monetary policy, and we’ll be subject to pressure on that going forward.  We bought those—as has been emphasized several times, and President Kocherlakota has made this point—at a time when markets were in fact dysfunctional.  And while there might have been a good reason for doing it at that time, I think it’s less clear that that’s necessary in the current environment.   Yesterday we discussed option 2 for redeeming Treasuries and moving to a shorter-term duration of our Treasury portfolio, even though we may be maintaining the size of our balance sheet.  I think that it’s important for us to continue that discussion and that it will be helpful for you to lay the groundwork in your July testimony for the beginning of that message.  So I would encourage us to continue to pursue that.  I think we have some real challenges ahead of us, but I just want to emphasize that, despite the risks, our forecast is still in place.  And we need tocontinue our planning about how we will unwind ourselves from still extraordinary policy accommodation. I think we have to be very careful not to fool ourselves into a false sense of precision about the magnitude of actions that we take.  Our ability to predict the effect on aggregate demand, or unemployment rates, from a move of 10 or 20 basis points, in reaction to either an asset sale or a decision on our part, is remarkably imprecise and completely unknown.  After all, the 10-year Treasury note has fallen almost 50 basis points in the last two months, with no action on our part.  Given that we have so little ability to predict these effects, I think we shouldn’t tie our hands, worrying excessively about those sorts of moves.  I think President Hoenig was correct that we need to keep our focus on the long-term consequences of our actions.  And while the short term is surely important, again, we must not sacrifice the long term for the short term.  That’s what central banks are for and what monetary policy ought to be focused on. I can live with alternative B at this point.  I do have one observation about the language, and that’s in paragraph 2.  I share President Bullard’s concern about using slack as the primary variable that policymakers look at.  I’ve talked about that for at least two years now, so I won’t mention it any more.  But I would say I’m puzzled by the insertion of the first sentence in paragraph 2 about energy prices.  I don’t know why we want to bring that into this discussion.  I’d be perfectly happy just to leave the statement as it was last time.  Our ability to pick and choose certain relative prices over others to throw into the statement, to try to explain what’s going on, seems to me not very productive.  So I would just as soon get rid of that first sentence and leave it as it was before.  And that’s my only suggestion.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is sharing his thoughts and expressing his concerns, but there is no direct disagreement with other participants in the discussion.


Passage number 270.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentions or disagreements as it only expresses gratitude towards President Evans.


Passage number 271.
MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with alternative B, and I am fine with the coupon swaps.  I’d like to agree with President Bullard—I think that he has a good point on including the size of our balance sheet as a tool of monetary policy in paragraph 3.  It does seem that we’ve spent a lot of time talking about a second tool of policy aimed at term premiums, and language indicating that the Committee has injected a large amount of liquidity through LSAPs and will maintain our target rate for the federal funds rate would be accurate in describing what our tools are.  It may be difficult to do, though. Given our collective outlook and policy objectives, I continue to believe that substantial monetary policy accommodation will be appropriate for a good while, so I agree with the “extended period” language.  I take this stance, however, mindful of the many policy risks that we face.  In particular, although I put little weight on some issues at the moment, it does seem that it would be proper due diligence to consider some criticisms about earlier periods of highly accommodative policy and ask if we’re sufficiently insulated from adverse outcomes this time around.  Specifically, I’m thinking about John Taylor’s arguments that policy remained too accommodative during the 2003–2006 period, which contributed to financial markets’ failing to price risks adequately.  Are these same risks relevant today.  What actions would best safeguard against them. Although our forecasts are underrunning our objectives, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman—and as did many others—it seems natural to me that many are uncomfortable with our now 18-month-old policy of a zero federal funds rate and a pretty large balance sheet.  As President Hoenig mentioned, the recovery is on, economic growth is okay, though it’s not robust, and zero seems like a very low interest rate for us to be targeting.  But there is a bit of déjà vu of the earlier period right now.  We again have large-scale joblessness, and maybe some further joblosses coming—who knows.—even though economic growth has picked up.  Indeed, one reply to Taylor’s 2003 criticisms is that policy at that time does not look as accommodative if one focuses on Taylor rules that use labor data, like the unemployment rate, instead of output gap data, which he has emphasized. How about today.  Well, in the Tealbook, the labor-market-based optimal control rules may have the funds rate negative until 2013, so the labor market is contributing to that.  And it’s possible, as others have mentioned, that there are structural elements to the high unemployment rate now and the labor market difficulties.  But even abstracting from that, looking at the output-based Taylor rules, they point to continued very low, zero funds rates for an extended period, into 2012.  And, as I’ve mentioned at other times, there are many other indicators of resource slack.  So the downtrend in the inflation numbers is not consistent, in my mind, with us having experienced a large drop in potential output.  Slack in labor and product markets currently is sufficient to outweigh the anchor of inflation expectations at the moment. My point simply is this:  The projected output and inflation paths corroborate the labor market justification for our policy stance, in my opinion.  And it’s hard to see the same forces building that John Taylor spoke of in that earlier period, 2003–2006.  So I think that accommodation is a robustly appropriate policy at the moment. I certainly agree with your observations, Mr. Chairman, that our policy choices should be symmetric with regard to our dual mandate goals.  I’ve said before, as Governor Kohn mentioned, that I would prefer a policy with an even lower interest rate, if that were possible—it’s not.  And I do worry about the argument concerning diminishing returns for some of our policy actions.  I think that if we considered more large-scale asset purchases, we ought to talkabout that issue.  For example, would we be stimulating certain sectors of the economy, which already are struggling, like housing.  How would we deal with that.  Finally, I think the forward-looking language falls into this category, too.  There’s only so much we could get out of extending the “extended period” language.  In theory, yes, but, in practice, I’m doubtful—I agree with President Bullard’s comments in that regard.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 273.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I think the uncertainties are too great to adjust our policy in either direction at this meeting.  The economy is recovering gradually, but the European debt crisis and the resulting lower appetite for risk in financial markets are risks to the recovery.  The inflation data continue to show a broad disinflationary pattern, and compensation data have been weak, and have led to yet another round of lower inflation projections. My baseline outlook is still consistent with alternative B, but, in my view, the risks for both inflation and output are weighted to the downside.  I do think that these downside risks warrant discussion of actions we could take in the event of an adverse shock.  While I’m still satisfied with the state of our exit strategy discussion, I do think we should devote some time to talk about policy alternatives that we have if the downside risks materialize.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Ms. Pianalto, is expressing her support for alternative B and giving her reasons for her stance. There is no apparent disagreement or contention in the passage.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The passage consists of a simple expression of gratitude directed towards Governor Warsh. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 275.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the current situation, I support alternative B and the coupon swap as requested by Brian and the Desk.In terms of the statement itself, I think paragraph 1 will sound to markets a little stronger than expectations—not a lot, but a little.  There’s some language in it that makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  Describing the E&S spending as appearing to rise at a robust pace sounds a little ahead of where our discussion has been.  But I don’t want to micromanage the statement. In terms of the other policy considerations, building on what you said, Mr. Chairman, about diminishing returns of the QE regime, I would say we are past the point of diminishing returns.  The judgments we made on the size of our asset purchases were made amid a ton of uncertainty.  I don’t think any of us knew with precision what that optimal point was.  Looking back, it appears to me as though we went past the point where we were getting net benefits.  That judgment, and the different judgments we have on that question, should inform our moves in either direction for policy going forward, whether there’s more that should be done through the balance sheet or whether there should be a period of what I describe as opportunistic divestment of some of our MBS holdings, perhaps akin to opportunistic disinflation from central bank meetings of the past. In order to have that discussion, though, about trying to find what the equilibrium level of our balance sheet is, it strikes me that the most important discussion, both for us and for the public to understand, is that we have multiple tools, not one.  I continue to believe that, if we were to announce at this moment that we were shrinking our balance sheet, it would likely bring forward expectations of a policy shift, because the public thinks that the size of the balance sheet is directly linked to policy rates.  I don’t think that’s a proper understanding, so my policy predilection would be to try to describe as clearly as we can that we have multiple policy tools, and, consistent with the minutes from last time and your discussion, Mr. Chairman, it is still the case, I think, for most around the table that the policy rate is the predominant tool.But there are other tools that might move, and we could imagine circumstances where the size and composition of the balance sheet might move in ways that doesn’t or ought not bring the policy rate expectations forward or back.  So I’ll say just a word on each of the three policies—size, composition, and policy rate—from my own perspective. In terms of size, as you said, Mr. Chairman, it’s hard to know what we’d buy if we wanted to expand the balance sheet, and what benefits we would get.  In terms of composition, I think that if we were to make a decision to buy Treasuries under an LSAP program, the consequences for our credibility, given the current fiscal question, would be very significant, so I would be quite allergic to that, given what we know now.  Finally, on the policy rate, I hope and expect that the Tealbook is wrong, that is, I hope that policy moves with greater force and greater speed than anticipated in the Tealbook.  But, again, given my own sense of when it’s going to move, and given the market’s reaction and understanding of what “extended period” means, “extended period” is fine in the statement as written. Just a final point:  I’ll join many of my colleagues in saying that the work done by staff in preparation for this meeting was really helpful, really extraordinary.  But I would also say that the staff work is a shared burden for all of us and for all of our staffs.  And I think there is incredible talent around the System, and it is very well funded.  So, as we think about new projects, I think that our staff here will continue to be doing a ton of work to prepare for these meetings, but I don’t think the burden should rest totally with them.  And I’d encourage my colleagues to think about work that can be done to inform your own thinking and the broader thinking by your own teams.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and the coupon swap, and providing their perspective on various policy considerations. They also express appreciation for the work done by the staff and emphasize the importance of sharing the burden of research and preparation among colleagues.


Passage number 276.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it simply includes a polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 277.
MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B and the coupon swap.  I’d still like to see us normalize our balance sheet, including the duration of the Treasury portfolio, but I recognize that this is not the time to do so, and I’m cautioned by the potential that our next move would be further accommodation. I’m actually frightened about the idea of getting memos from 12 different Reserve Banks.  [Laughter]  But the staff’s work has been incredibly helpful.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses their preference for alternative B and the coupon swap, and acknowledges that now may not be the right time to normalize the balance sheet. They also express caution about receiving memos from 12 different Reserve Banks, but overall, there is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 279.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor the policy actions in alternative B, but not necessarily all of the language.  Alternative B, as drafted, does not seem to me to reflect either what I described as my modal projection or the tail risks that many of us have talked about.  With respect to the tail risks, I am not sure it would be particularly helpful to specify those in our statement, and they will be evident in the minutes when they’re released in a few weeks.  But, with respect to the projections of the economy, I think that there was a palpable change in the attitude of the Committee, and I agree with Kevin that alternative B, paragraph 1, is rather more upbeat than either the Tealbook forecast or what most of us had to say around the table.  Initially, I was going to say I just favor the language in alternative A, but I only see two differences between A and B, one of which is the insertion of “in recent months” to “bank lending has continued to contract,” and that doesn’t strike me as a salient difference.  So I would favor more particularly the substitution of the last sentence of paragraph 1 in alternative A for the last sentence of paragraph 1 of alternative B.  I thought that the effort in the first red insertion in paragraph 3 of alternative A—if I understand it correctly—to try to specify a bit more our reaction function was and is an interesting and good effort.  I don’t think the language quitecaptures probably what all of us would agree to, but I think it would be worth doing more along those lines for the next couple of meetings. The only other thing I’d say, Mr. Chairman, is in support of my argument for the sentence change in the first paragraph.  I recall the debate last year, which included, to some degree, people around this table, between those who said that the mixed data we were seeing at the time were eminently characteristic of the early stages of a pretty strong recovery, and that we would pretty soon see things converging around stronger data more or less across the board, and those who predicted that this was going to be a halting recovery in which there were going to be potholes, or headwinds, or some other metaphor, looking out a fair time into the future, and thus we are going to continue to see a pattern that was sort of two steps forward, one step back. I think that, nine months later, that debate has been, at least in the medium term, clearly decided in favor of the latter camp.  So I think we’ve got to come to grips with the fact that, even in the modal forecast, this is not a lot of strength, and this does not promise anything close to the achievement of at least one side of the dual mandate, and, I suspect, increasingly, both sides of the dual mandate.  I don’t know how many years it takes before the high levels of unemployment that we all project constitute the long run rather than the short run.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the language used in alternative B and argues for the substitution of certain sentences from alternative A. They also mention a debate from the previous year that seems to have divided people at the table.


Passage number 280.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.

The phrase "Thank you" and the title "Vice Chairman" do not express any disagreement or contentious nature. They are merely expressions of gratitude and a formal designation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 281.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B, and I’m fine with the coupon swap as proposed by the staff.  That said, it wouldn’t take much in terms of weaker economic data, lower inflation, and further financial market distress for me to prefer alternative A.  I am concerned, in particular, that any significant weakening in the economic data from here could raise fears of a double dip, and that, in turn, might increase the risk of further risk aversion and a further tightening of financial conditions, which would actuallymake the double dip more likely.  I think that, in those circumstances, alternative A would be appropriate.  I’m not quite there yet, but it wouldn’t take much to push me there. If economic conditions deteriorated and financial markets were to tighten, it would be important at that stage for the FOMC to show that our toolbox was not empty and that we were still willing and able to act to lean against such developments.  I think a failure to act at that particular point would be quite dangerous, because it would reinforce fears that there was limited scope for further economic policy support, and that would create even greater fears of a double dip.  In terms of escalation, I think we’ve laid out what the options are:  We could stop redemptions of agency MBS, we could restart a purchase program of Treasuries and/or agency MBS, we could change the language in the statement to try to commit to lower short-term rates for a longer period of time, or we could cut the IOER rate. I think the bar to reinvesting maturing agency MBS should be pretty low, because that’s really just maintaining the status quo.  Letting the agency MBS run off is essentially a de facto—very modest but, still, de facto—tightening of policy over time.  I don’t think it’s going to be very stressful on the economy, but I don’t think the bar to reinvesting the agency MBS should be very high.  I do agree with Governor Warsh and others that bar to expanding the balance sheet should be considerably higher for a whole variety of reasons. In terms of changing the language, although it’s an option, I don’t have any really great ideas that I think would be particularly helpful.  “Extraordinarily low for an extended period” is already pretty strong, and the market doesn’t seem to be off base in their expectations relative to our own expectations.  I suppose we could commit to some sort of price level target, so that any undershooting on inflation over the next couple of years would be reversed down the road, but, as we’ve discussed in the past, I think that has real communication difficulties right now.In terms of the interest on excess reserves that Governor Kohn raised as a potential option, I think it certainly should be examined, and I’d like to see a little bit more work done on what the costs and benefits of that are; that is, how much market dysfunction we’d create by cutting the IOER rate further versus what the benefits would be in terms of the signal that we would be sending to markets.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses a preference for alternative B initially, but also states that they could be open to alternative A depending on economic conditions. They argue that failing to act at a certain point could be dangerous and reinforce fears of limited economic policy support. They also discuss different options for action, such as stopping redemptions of agency MBS or changing language in the statement, but express differing opinions on the bar for expanding the balance sheet. There is also disagreement on the potential use of the interest on excess reserves as an option.


Passage number 282.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is because it only mentions the name "President Bullard" and does not provide any information or context to suggest any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 301.
 MR. BULLARD.  On this issue of mentioning quantitative easing somehow in the statement, you do have paragraph 4 in alternative A, which is slightly different from paragraph 4 in alternative B, and it makes a little more reference to the fact that we will evaluate the balance sheet going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, is simply pointing out that there is a slight difference between two alternatives regarding the mention of quantitative easing in paragraph 4 of a statement. There is no indication of disagreement or argument.


Passage number 302.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think that raises other issues that we’ve discussed before about what we want to signal about our balance sheet, but your point is noted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker acknowledges and appreciates the point made by the other person without expressing disagreement or contention.

  It may be an asymmetric interpretation MR. BULLARD.  Why is that.  It just says evaluate the holdings of securities.

Passage number 305.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, because it suggests, as we have discussed before, that we are looking potentially to near-term sales or purchases.

Passage number 306.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It’s coming out of alternative A, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of fact. It does not express any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 307.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, that’s true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Well, that’s true" indicates agreement and there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 308.
  That’s because it was including purchases MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It’s including purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is stating a fact about something being included in a past event.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other thoughts.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Any other thoughts" is an invitation for readers to share their own opinions or additional ideas, but it does not suggest any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints within the passage itself. The mention of President Fisher does not provide enough context to determine whether there is disagreement or contention between the passage and President Fisher.


Passage number 314.
 MR. FISHER.  I had asked a question, Mr. Chairman, about whether we were crossing the line if we added what we heard from many people about the uncertainty about tax and regulatory requirements.  I just want some definition here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is simply seeking clarification and definition on a specific topic.


Passage number 315.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think referring to political uncertainty would be crossing the line.  Putting in general uncertainty might be acceptable, but I’m not quite sure I see where to do that.  Do you have a suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their hesitation and uncertainty about including political uncertainty, and is seeking suggestions or guidance from someone else.


Passage number 316.
 MR. FISHER.  No, not for that specific reference, but it is going to come through in the minutes, and that’s sufficient.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher agrees that the reference will come through in the minutes and considers that sufficient.


Passage number 317.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  If there are no further comments, we’ll take the roll, please.

 MR. LUECKE.  This roll will encompass alternative B as printed on page 4 of the handouts for Brian’s briefing on policy alternatives, with the exception that the first sentence will refer to “economic recovery is proceeding” instead of “economic activity has continued to strengthen.”  Second, it will refer to “business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly” instead of “equipment and software appear to be rising at a robust pace.”  It will also encompass the directive as printed on page 8 of the handout.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply describes how a certain roll will be modified by changing some specific sentences.


Passage number 319.
 Chairman Bernanke  Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes President Bullard   Yes Governor Duke   Yes President Hoenig   No Governor Kohn   Yes President Pianalto   Yes President Rosengren  Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes Governor Warsh   YesCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  A couple of quick other items.  Brian Madigan will be stepping down before the next meeting, effective July 23, as the FOMC Secretary and Economist.  We would like to propose Bill English to succeed him as the head of the Monetary Affairs Division to fill that position for the rest of this year until next January when we will have our annual election.  If we move Bill to that position, that would leave open an Associate Economist position.  Bill and Jim Clouse have been alternating in that Associate Economist position.  So it would be natural to make Jim Clouse the Associate Economist for the Committee, and I’d like to propose that.  Any comments, questions.

Passage number 322.
 MR. FISHER.  On behalf of, at least, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and I think all the Reserve Banks, I’d like to offer an appreciation for the way Brian has conducted himself.  He has been very respectful of the input of the Banks, and the courtesy—punctilious courtesy would be the best description—has been truly remarkable.  I hope it’s noted that his work is deeply appreciated, obviously, by the Board, but also by the Reserve Banks and their staffs. PARTICIPANTS.  Here, here.
