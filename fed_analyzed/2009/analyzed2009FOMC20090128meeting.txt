Passage number 1.
 Hetzel, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on   January 27–28, 2009  January 27, 2009—Afternoon Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon, everybody.  Last night Michelle Smith and I attended the swearing in of Tim Geithner by Vice President Biden, with President Obama in attendance. So we now have a new Treasury Secretary.  There will be a dinner tonight after the meeting at which we will honor Tim and say good-bye from this post as he goes into another.  This is a new year and new things, and so this morning the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced their new President—Bill Dudley. Congratulations, Bill.  You made it all the way across the table. [Laughter, followed by applause]  We welcome you and look forward to working with you in your new capacity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information about the swearing-in of Tim Geithner and the announcement of Bill Dudley as the new President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Passage number 2.
 MR. DUDLEY. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It simply shows gratitude.


Passage number 3.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. As you know, Governor Kroszner resigned in anticipation of the appointment of the new Governor, Dan Tarullo.  But Dan has not yet cleared the Senate, so obviously he won’t be attending the meeting, which leaves the Governors here as an embattled few, [laughter] and I think the lowest number of sitting Governors probably in a very long time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply provides information about the resignation of Governor Kroszner and the absence of Governor Dan Tarullo from a meeting, leaving a small number of sitting Governors.


Passage number 4.
  MR. FISHER. Not in quality.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Fisher is simply stating that there is no issue with the quality of something.


Passage number 5.
 MR. LACKER. We will go easy on you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, states that they will go easy on the person they are addressing, suggesting a friendly or lenient approach.


Passage number 6.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let me also welcome the new members cycling into the FOMC as voting members—Jeff Lacker, Charlie Evans, Dennis Lockhart, and Janet Yellen. The first part of the meeting is the annual organizational part for the FOMC, so we will be just in FOMC mode for the next few minutes.  After we do that business, we will go into a joint Board–FOMC meeting, as earlier I discussed and we talked about this new way of  operating. We need to begin with the election of Committee officers.  I need a motion for appointment of the Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply describing the agenda for the meeting and the process for appointing a chairman.


Passage number 7.
 MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure and an honor to recommend Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of this Committee.  I am not sure what sins you committed in an earlier life, but I sure hope you had fun.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite request for a motion.


Passage number 20.
 MR. KOHN. So move. SEVERAL. Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kohn asked someone to move and several individuals seconded the motion.


Passage number 21.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Without objection.  Thank you. The next item on the agenda is the selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account. Sorry, am I on the wrong item here.  Is that a different order.  Okay. I’m sorry, I missed an item.  Item 2 is a proposed revision to the program for security of FOMC information.  You received a memo from Scott Alvarez and Debbie Danker.  This appeared to be mostly minor procedural changes to the rules.  The most substantive change was a rule affecting the access to confidential information of people who are not regular employees—i.e., consultants. Are there any questions for Scott or Debbie or any comments.  A motion, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the agenda items and asking for questions or comments.


Passage number 22.
 MR. KOHN. So move. PARTICIPANT. Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple exchange between two individuals. Mr. Kohn makes a statement, and another participant seconds the motion. There is no contention or disagreement evident in this passage.


Passage number 23.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Without objection.  Thank you.  All right. Now we go on to item 3, selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to operate the SOMA.  In a shocking development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has again expressed willingness to serve in this capacity.  [Laughter] In this context, I would like to take note of a memo that was sent to the Committee by Louise Roseman and the Division of Reserve Bank Operations about their assessment of the controls and procedures related to the SOMA and the management of the various new facilities.  They found that those controls were effective and that the SOMA activities complied with established directives, guidelines, and procedures.  So I think the report we have is that New  York is doing a fine job and should continue to carry out this function.  May I have a motion, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 24.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide information that suggests contention or disagreement between the speaker (Mr. Kohn) and any other person or entity.


Passage number 25.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Second. Comment.  Without objection.  Thank you. Item 4 is the selection of the manager of the System Open Market Account.  We now have changing leadership in New York, and therefore we are not quite ready to select a permanent manager or to vote.  Prior to the meeting, I appointed Trish Mosser as temporary manager of the Open Market Desk.  We will come back to the Committee for a vote when a permanent position is established. Okay. Now that Trish is here, she gets to do some work, I guess.  We have three items— 5, 6, and 7: a proposed revision to the authorization for domestic open market operations, a proposed revision to the authorization for foreign-currency operations, and a proposed treatment of the guidelines for the conduct of system open market operations in federal agency issues.  Trish, could you talk about all three of those briefly, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about the selection of a manager and discussing some proposed revisions.


Passage number 26.
 MS. MOSSER. Certainly. I would be happy to.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The proposed changes were discussed in a memo that went out to the Committee last week as well as in a memo that proposed a slight amendment to the domestic authorization that was circulated yesterday.  Let me start with the foreign-currency area, for which there are three distinct parts to consider. With respect to the authorization for foreign-currency operations, we propose keeping the 2008 authorization mostly unchanged.  We have one modest alteration.  We propose adding four additional currencies to the list of permissible foreign exchange purchases and sales—the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the Korean won, and the New Zealand dollar.  This is being done to reflect the foreign exchange swap agreements that were put in place in 2008 with the central banks. On the foreign-currency directive, we are currently recommending no changes.  Regarding the procedural instructions with respect to foreign-currency operations, we are proposing a slight modification to the introductory paragraph, adding the words “unless otherwise directed by the Committee,” to recognize explicitly that the instructions can be superseded by the Committee.  I can pause now for a vote on the foreign side, or I can continue on and talk about the rest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply presenting proposed changes and modifications, without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments being presented.


Passage number 27.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Could you go through all three, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple request for someone to go through three things. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 28.
 MS. MOSSER. Sure. I would be happy to.  With respect to the authorization for domestic open market operations, we are proposing several amendments.  The specific changes include, first, minor changes to consolidate language for repo and reverse repo operations into a single paragraph; second, the addition of a new paragraph 2 that codifies the New York Fed’s authority to transact in agency mortgage-backed securities for the SOMA portfolio using agents, such as asset managers and a custodial bank.  This paragraph also allows the custodial agent to engage in repo transactions in order to manage the cash balances that are generated by agency MBS holdings. Third, we are adding language in the final paragraph, as suggested by a Reserve Bank President, that makes explicit the authority of the SOMA manager, following instructions from the Chairman, to take actions that “result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the System Open Market Account.”  This authority, however, would be subject to the requirements, set out in the last sentence of the paragraph, that the Chairman consult with the Committee, if feasible.  It would also make clear that “any such adjustment shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting.”  The intended effect of the proposed revisions is to place the governance of intermeeting changes by the   Chairman in the size and the composition of the SOMA portfolio on the same footing as changes in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and the fed funds rate. Last, in light of the Federal Reserve’s current program of purchases of agency debt and agency MBS, the staff recommends that the guidelines for agency debt and agency MBS purchases be temporarily suspended.  The status of the guidelines will then be reviewed at next year’s January FOMC meeting. I should note that there is a precedent for this.  For example, paragraphs 3 through 6 of this document were temporarily suspended by the Committee in August 1999. At the time, the SOMA manager was concerned about the Desk’s capacity to respond to any Y2K year-end effects and sought the authority to accept agency debt and agency MBS collateral.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply outlines proposed amendments and recommendations without any conflicting opinions.


Passage number 29.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. I would like to comment on the implications of items 5 and 7, in particular for our GSE purchase program.  In late November, as you know, I directed the Open Market Desk to begin a program of purchasing MBS and agency debt, based on the authorizations to do that and a consultation by phone that Don and I had with all the members of the FOMC.  At the time, I felt comfortable with that decision.  Since then, given how central the MBS purchase program has become to our policy and given the issues of governance that have been raised and we have all discussed, I now believe that I made a mistake in doing that—I should have consulted more closely and then taken a vote of the FOMC.  So I want to pledge to you that I will not take any similar actions in the future without a formal consultation. Now, the effect of item 5 is essentially to make that part of the rules.  Item 5 puts the substantial changes in the portfolio on the same footing as a change in the federal funds rate—i.e., the strong presumption is that this will be done in formal consultation with the Committee and that the Chairman retains the right to make intermeeting adjustments but only in  situations where consultation is not feasible.  Again, I believe this is the right direction in which to go, and I support making that change. On item 7, on the guidelines for purchases of agencies, I think this is a useful clarification. I also support this.  But I would like to at least record that, in my own view, I don’t think that our MBS purchase program is credit allocation in the sense that this guideline was intended to address—for several reasons. First, to my mind, credit allocation involves a preference for a certain class of borrowers relative to what normally functioning markets would throw up. In this case, the issue is not an attempt to distort allocations away from some efficient outcome; rather, it is our intention to try to make markets work better and to bring us closer to a normal market outcome.  Second, I view the MBS purchase program as being really very close to monetary policy in spirit and intent in that we are trying to address broad issues of macroeconomic stability by stimulating an important component of aggregate demand.  So we are using this particular tool not because we have a preference for housing but because we are trying to stimulate overall aggregate demand.  Indeed, as you know, we are in fact looking at various types of credit in order to achieve that.  I think this is similar to the normal use of monetary policy, which affects different sectors differently, not because we have a preference for one sector or another but because our tools allow us to address different components of aggregate demand with different force. I am saying all of this because I do have this view, and I want to get it out on the table.  Nevertheless, I think it is a clarification and useful for us to formally suspend these guidelines for the time being.  That is my take.  Let me open the floor for comments and questions on any of these three items.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses their support for items 5 and 7 and also shares their personal view on the MBS purchase program, but there is no conflicting opinion or argument presented.


Passage number 30.
 MR. FISHER. First, Mr. Chairman, I think this may be the first time that a Wellesley woman has had responsibility for the Trading Desk.  I am married to a Wellesley woman.  I am used to being tutored by a Wellesley woman.  [Laughter] So I have two questions that I would like to ask, just out of ignorance.  The first is about the 65-day rule, particularly—and I may not understand this—but in paragraph 1(B) and then paragraph 4, the requirement to resell after 65 days or less, does that apply in the case of MBS or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their personal connection to Wellesley College and then posing a question out of ignorance.


Passage number 31.
 MS. MOSSER. No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 32.
 MR. FISHER. Okay. Then the second: Is the limit on $25 billion of an open position in all foreign currencies still current.  Is that appropriate under current circumstances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 33.
 MS. MOSSER. It is. However, based on a previous vote, we have exempted the fluctuations in the value of foreign portfolios due to changes in the exchange rates.  We do nothing at this point but passively invest both our yen and our euro portfolios.  But given the size of exchange rate movements that we have, it would be possible at some point for us inadvertently to exceed a $25 billion limit.  So we are assuming that we fixed an exchange rate at a time when we were under $25 billion, and we determined that, if we happen to go over inadvertently, it would not be a good idea then to go into the market and actively buy or sell foreign exchange to undo that. So other than that exemption, yes, we are abiding by that, and that is in force right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the current investment strategy and the exemption in place for fluctuations in the value of foreign portfolios.


Passage number 34.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is simply expressing gratitude and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 35.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement stated in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 36.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I applaud the changes in item 5 to the domestic authorization.  I will note here that it has been a triennial tradition for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President to dissent on the foreign-currency-related directives.  I am  going to break with tradition and support them. Our opposition in the past had to do with their use and the implications in foreign exchange operations that struck us as off-balance-sheet fiscal policy that was more properly done by the Treasury. However, I would like to share a couple of comments on the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues.  Let me just state at the outset that, in my view, they conflict with what we are doing now with agencies.  “Credit allocation” is a term of art, and I think there is room for reasonable people, in good faith, to take different positions on what that means, as is the case with terms like “normal market functioning” as well.  I think of the term in this context by comparing purchasing agency securities with some broader-based purchase of a similar quantity.  I think we will have an opportunity to discuss this later in agenda item 8, but that thought experiment leads me to believe that these operations must, compared with a broader-based purchase of Treasuries, lower particular market sectors’ interest rates relative to others and leave others higher than they otherwise would be.  I recognize that there are members—in fact, the broad majority here—who probably want to continue with the program and not suspend the guidelines. If I had my choice, I would not suspend the guidelines; I would suspend the program.  So what I would like to do is respectfully register a negative vote on this.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement and contention in this passage. This is indicated by the statement "I am going to break with tradition and support them" in reference to the changes in item 5. The speaker also states that the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues conflict with what they are currently doing with agencies, and they express a desire to suspend the program. This shows a disagreement with the majority who want to continue with the program and not suspend the guidelines.


Passage number 37.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly. Other questions or comments.  All right. If we are ready to vote, then, why don’t we do them separately, beginning first with the revision to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.  Do we have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 38.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply instructing to move without any indication of disagreement or opposition.


Passage number 39.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Are there any objections.  Any “no” votes.  Everybody okay.  I take that as unanimous.  Second, the revision to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. I need a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The language used suggests that the speaker is looking for agreement and seeking approval from the audience. The absence of objections or "no" votes, as well as the assumption of unanimity, indicates that there is no contention. The phrase "I need a motion" implies a request for a formal approval rather than a disagreement.


Passage number 40.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not display any form of contention or disagreement. It only states a statement without any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 41.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Are there any objections.  “No” votes. Hearing none. Third, the proposed treatment of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues.  Given what President Lacker said, why don’t we call the roll on this one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrases "No votes" and "Hearing none" indicate that there are no objections or disagreements. The mention of President Lacker's statement is not related to any disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 42.
  MS. DANKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 43.
  Chairman Bernanke Yes  Vice Chairman Dudley Yes  Governor Duke Yes  President Evans Yes  Governor Kohn Yes  President Lacker No  President Lockhart Yes  Governor Warsh Yes  President Yellen Yes  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. All right.  That covers the organizational items.  At this point I would like to convene a Board meeting joint with the FOMC.  I need a motion to close the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions which individuals agree or disagree with something, but does not provide any information about what they are agreeing or disagreeing on.


Passage number 44.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage provided only includes a statement without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 45.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right. Thank you.  So now for the rest of today and tomorrow, we will be in joint session.  Let’s turn now to our regular Desk reports, starting with Trish, and these reports will include not only our regular financial updates but also the broader discussion of balance sheet issues and so on that we talked about at our videoconference.  Trish.  1 The materials used by Ms. Mosser and Mr. Hilton are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the agenda for the rest of the day and tomorrow.


Passage number 46.
   MR. MADIGAN. Thank you. The staff is recommending that the Board and the FOMC act to extend the various liquidity facilities that are scheduled to expire on April 30. The PDCF, the TSLF, the AMLF, the CPFF, the MMIFF, and the temporary reciprocal foreign-currency arrangements are all currently scheduled to expire at the end of April.  As Trish noted, conditions in some financial markets have improved somewhat in recent months, but those improvements have been limited.  With the macroeconomic situation and the condition of financial institutions both deteriorating significantly, the recent improvements would seem to be attributable not to any strengthening of the fundamentals but rather to the range of actions taken by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the FDIC, the Congress, and foreign central banks and governments to stabilize the financial system as well as to the passage of year-end. As Spence has noted, even though the usage of some facilities has declined, amounts outstanding under some programs, such as the CPFF, remain substantial.  Moreover, the level of usage is by no means an adequate metric for assessing the contributions of these programs to stabilizing markets.  In many cases, market participants continue to look to the facilities as important backstops for their funding.  In these circumstances, it would seem premature to consider terminating any of the existing liquidity facilities at this time. Although the facilities do not expire for three months, the staff believes that the Board and the FOMC should act now to extend them.  Absent an action to extend the programs, market participants and analysts are likely to speculate increasingly about the Federal Reserve’s intentions for the facilities, which probably would add unhelpfully to market jitters.  Also, lenders may increasingly become concerned that borrowers will not have access to backup funding facilities to repay currently extended loans when those credits mature in a few weeks and hence could become more chary about lending now. The staff recommends that the Board and the FOMC extend the expiring facilities through October 30. This six-month extension from April 30 should be sufficient for now to assure market participants that the lending programs will be available for the period of time relevant for money market transactions.  A case could be made for an even longer extension to take the programs over year-end—say through January 30, 2010—but you may be concerned that such a very long extension could signal a view that the financial crisis will be quite protracted.  Also, for the programs that depend on the Board’s section 13(3) authority, the requirement to find that unusual and exigent circumstances are present may be interpreted as making it difficult to extend these programs for a full year from now.  If you do extend the facilities through October, as recommended, you may wish to plan informally on revisiting the expiration dates of these programs around the time of your June or August meeting so that you will be able to provide advance notice to market participants about whether or not the programs will be extended beyond October. Some of the Federal Reserve’s special programs—for example, the TAF—do not have a set expiration date and hence do not need to be extended.  Also, the TALF is not set to expire until year-end.  Thus, under the staff proposal to extend the otherexpiring facilities through October 30, the TALF would not need to be extended at this time. If the Board and the FOMC act at this meeting to extend the programs, the staff anticipates that the extensions would be announced to the public on Thursday at 10:00 a.m.  Because the swap lines are among the items proposed for extension, part of the press release would be joint with our foreign central bank counterparties.  Draft resolutions for consideration by the Board and the FOMC were included in the staff memo on this matter.  Trish will now continue our presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 47.
 MS. MOSSER. Thank you. I am going to discuss long-term Treasury purchases by the SOMA for a few minutes.  Last week, we circulated a memo outlining four options with respect to the long-term Treasury purchase program.  To summarize:  Option 1 is to retain purchases as an option but not to implement at this time; option 2 is to implement a pilot program; option 3 is to implement a large-scale purchase program; and option 4 is to purchase illiquid long-term Treasuries not with the explicit goal of bringing down longer-term yields but to improve Treasury market functioning. In addition, of course, there was an implicit option of announcing that a long-term Treasury purchase program was completely off the table.  The staff recommended option 1—retain the program as an option that continues to be evaluated but don’t implement at the current time.   The staff demurred from implementing such a program at this time for five reasons. First, for the further expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that would be needed, this program was viewed as likely to be less effective dollar for dollar in easing financial conditions than programs more directly linked to credit formation and to markets with more impaired liquidity.  Second, it was unclear how big such a program would need to be to push down yields significantly from their current quite low levels. A large program might not do much at these levels.  In that case, the program would be an especially inefficient use of balance sheet capacity.  Third, such a program could potentially distort the relationship between Treasury and private-sector yields, affecting Treasury yields while having little effect on private rates. This could potentially undermine the value of Treasuries as a hedging vehicle.  Fourth, such a program might even have adverse effects.  In particular, some commentators would almost certainly argue that such purchases amounted simply to “monetizing the federal deficit.”  Although it is difficult to assess what effect such arguments would have on financial markets, worries on this score could conceivably lead to higher risk premiums, which could undermine the program’s effectiveness.  Fifth, the program would increase the interest rate risk inherent in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet because the long-term Treasuries would be funded by excess reserves—an overnight obligation. This means that, if short-term rates rose in the future, the Fed’s net interest margin could be squeezed, potentially generating losses for taxpayers. The staff does recommend, however, keeping the program alive as an option.  After all, some of the decline in Treasury yields since early December may be due to expectations of such a program in the future.  If the Committee endorses the staff’s recommendation, to retain it as an option but not implement it at this time, will long­term Treasury yields rise significantly—say more than 10 or 20 basis points.  That does not seem likely. First, most market participants, even those that believe the FOMC will purchase long-term Treasuries eventually, do not anticipate that the Federal Reserve will necessarily begin purchases right away.  They generally believe that, with Treasury yields as low as they are currently, there is no need to commence such a purchase program immediately.  Second, market participants are placing a probability of only about 50 percent that such a program will be implemented at all.  That’s based on our latest primary dealer survey.  If the program is kept on the shelf and remains a part of the tool kit and that is clearly communicated to the market via the FOMC statement, we would anticipate that this would generate at most only a modest backup in Treasury yields. Finally, the note distributed last week also contained some observations about some of the other options for moving ahead with purchases at this point and discussed some of the execution issues raised by the purchase program.  I’ll now turn to Nathan, who will continue our presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is presenting different options and discussing the staff's recommendation for a long-term Treasury purchase program. The staff provides reasons for their recommendation and acknowledges the possibility of adverse effects. The passage also mentions market participants' expectations and probabilities regarding the implementation of such a program.


Passage number 48.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. That was very informative and a lot to digest as well. Let me just remind the Committee that the only action item in the list, other than the ratification of domestic open market operations, is the proposal to extend the programs.  The discussions of Treasury purchases and foreign-currency swaps are just for information at this point. We will have an opportunity in a few minutes to have a discussion on these issues, but before we do that, let me first see if there are any questions for our colleagues.  Any questions for Trish or her colleagues.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude for the information presented and is clarifying the action items for the Committee. They also mention the opportunity for discussion and ask if there are any questions.


Passage number 49.
 MR. ROSENGREN. So the TALF is scheduled to end in January, but all the other programs with this vote will be scheduled to end in October, is that right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the scheduled end dates for different programs.


Passage number 50.
 MR. MADIGAN. The TALF—December 31.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the date of the TALF.


Passage number 51.
   MR. ROSENGREN. Year-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Year-end" is cut off and does not provide enough information to determine if there is any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 52.
 MR. MADIGAN. Yes, and for the other ones that have a maturity date, the extension would be through October 30.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Madigan, simply states that for the ones with a maturity date, the extension would be through October 30.


Passage number 53.
 MR. ROSENGREN. It seems a little peculiar to have different dates.  It seems particularly peculiar to have it end at the end of the year when that is likely to be a problematic time, regardless of whether things settle down.  So, actually, I would have a preference to go to  January. But if we are not going to go to January, I do think that we should discuss it at the June meeting, not the August meeting, because I know that there has been some uncertainty in the markets about which programs would be extended.  I don’t think the speculation has been particularly healthy, so it is better to have a little more clarity.  It might be worthwhile, if we are going to have it end in October, actually to include that it would be discussed in June so that people know that it will come up again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and suggesting a possible alternative.


Passage number 54.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. There is a tradeoff between giving people the assurance of a long period, and flexibility—not committing our balance sheet for an extended period.  But I agree with you that, if we do this, we ought to revisit it earlier rather than close to the date.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges the possible tradeoff and agrees with the listener's suggestion to revisit the decision earlier.


Passage number 55.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Yes. The August meeting seems a little late, given that there is likely to be speculation about year-end by August.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the timing of a meeting and a potential speculation that may arise.


Passage number 56.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments. It simply mentions President Evans without indicating any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 57.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Is it too early to ask for a few more details on the swap description that you were talking about.  In the following sense—there was nothing distributed on this, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The passage indicates that there is a request for more details, suggesting a potential lack of clarity or information distribution. This could lead to disagreement or contention as the conversation progresses.


Passage number 58.
 MR. SHEETS. Correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states a statement made by Mr. Sheets without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 59.
 MR. EVANS. Okay. Because the question that I asked before about the swaps—and I had been comforted by the answer—is what our loss exposure is when we provide swaps to foreign central banks. They stand behind them, so that is about as good as we have.  This is sounding a little different. If I understood what you were talking about, it is that we will be using them as an agent to provide funding to our troubled institutions, and some discussion about what guarantees and whatnot would be very helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 60.
 MR. SHEETS. The risk profile would be different for exactly the reason you suggest.  A lot of the analysis on this particular proposal has been done just over the past few days, and that is one reason that we are not presenting it with a fuller description and more detail.  But we certainly intend to continue to do that work, and as we make progress on some of these issues, we certainly plan to circulate a memo to the Committee describing some of the other issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 61.
  MR. EVANS. Is it too early to have some idea what the order of magnitude of the funding requirements might look like.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about the timing of determining the funding requirements.


Passage number 62.
 MR. SHEETS. We haven’t thought systematically about that issue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sheets indicates that "we" (presumably referring to a group or organization) have not given systematic thought to a specific issue.


Passage number 63.
  I mean, I could guess— MR. EVANS. I wouldn’t hold you to it, if you are willing to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty or a lack of knowledge, but there is no disagreement or conflicting views presented.


Passage number 64.
  MR. SHEETS. But I think it would probably be better not to guess.  Maybe Trish wants to guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sheets is simply suggesting that it might be better not to guess, and then offers a possible alternative explanation for Trish's behavior.


Passage number 65.
 [Laughter] MR. EVANS. I have noticed that the astute responders don’t go for that line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by someone observing the behavior of responders.


Passage number 66.
  [Laughter] MS. MOSSER. Potentially fairly large—particularly if we are considering more than one large institution. In the scenario that Nathan laid out, which is the risk that we are considering, we think it is somewhat less likely that we would use these lines for the sort of operations that most of our foreign central bank counterparties are using to distribute dollars, which are operations and tenders that are open to all. We don’t see that kind of need across a broad group of institutions and a broad group of banks around the United States.  But there is certainly a subset of institutions, many of them quite large with very sizable foreign exchange funding, that fund themselves in Asia, Europe, and South America.  Should those institutions end up being in worse financial shape, many of them actually have quite substantial collateral with us at the discount windows in the various Districts. But they would not need funding in dollars.  Theywould want to come to us instead and, for example, take out a discount loan—they could do it through other mechanisms—in a foreign currency rather than in dollars.  The way that we would then finance it—given the relatively modest size of our foreign exchange reserves and the fact that the reserves are only in two currencies—would be to establish swap lines and fund them that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 67.
 MR. EVANS. Okay. Thank you. That is very helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "That is very helpful" indicates agreement and appreciation.


Passage number 68.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman, did you have an intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The person is simply asking the Vice Chairman if they had an intervention.


Passage number 69.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, just a very brief one to reinforce Nathan’s point. We began discussions with the foreign central banks literally last week on this issue, and it was really begun because of the vulnerability that we felt on Martin Luther King’s Birthday with our being closed and what would happen in that environment—how we could get liquidity to a U.S. bank that might have difficulties abroad.  In terms of President Evans’s questions about risk, this is really no different from our lending domestically to a domestic institution against collateral that we hold, except that we are basically using that collateral to fund the foreign exchange swap.  So you can just think of it as equivalent to our lending to a domestic institution against the collateral they hold here in the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 70.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, do you have an intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question asking for the opinion or thoughts of President Lacker on a specific topic.


Passage number 71.
 MR. LACKER. You may have mentioned this, but who bears the foreign exchange risk in this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 72.
 MR. SHEETS. Maybe Vice Chairman Dudley and Trish have some thoughts on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sheets is simply suggesting that Vice Chairman Dudley and Trish might have some thoughts on the matter.


Passage number 73.
  MS. MOSSER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without the full passage provided, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the given text, as it only includes the name "MS. MOSSER".


Passage number 74.
 The way that we structure the foreign exchange swaps now is at a fixed exchange rate for both the front and the back leg, so that we don’t have— MR. LACKER. Right. So the other central bank bears it.  So in this case, who would bear it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are discussing the structure of foreign exchange swaps and agreeing that the other central bank bears the fixed exchange rate.


Passage number 75.
 MS. MOSSER. We would basically get back the dollars that we gave to them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a hypothetical situation.


Passage number 76.
 MR. LACKER. So we would bear the foreign exchange risk of the swap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is making a statement about bearing the foreign exchange risk of the swap. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this statement.


Passage number 77.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Details have not been addressed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage since there are no statements or claims made for there to be any disagreement about. The passage simply states that details have not been addressed, indicating a lack of information or discussion on a specific topic.


Passage number 78.
 MR. SHEETS. There is a new dimension to think through—that is, who is bearing the foreign exchange risk vis-à-vis our central bank counterparty.  And I don’t think the terms there are going to be different. But then, when we go on to lend that foreign exchange to our commercial bank, there is a new dimension in thinking about foreign exchange risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While the passage presents different dimensions to consider, there is no contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing the various aspects of foreign exchange risk but does not express any disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 79.
 MR. LOCKHART. That is a credit risk. That is not a foreign exchange risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lockhart simply states that the mentioned risk is a credit risk and not a foreign exchange risk.


Passage number 80.
 MR. SHEETS. Well, it depends on which currency it is being booked in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. Mr. Sheets is simply stating that the answer to a question depends on the currency in which it is being booked.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 81.
 MR. LACKER. Wait, wait, wait.  When you say it would be the same, it depends on whose point of view it is. The way Trish described it, we would bear the foreign exchange risk vis-à-vis the other central banks.  Is that what you are saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Mr. Lacker is questioning the assertion made by Trish and suggesting that the outcome would depend on the perspective or point of view taken.


Passage number 82.
 MR. SHEETS. We are still thinking through that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they are still considering a particular point.


Passage number 83.
 MS. MOSSER. That is the part that is still being worked out.  I am sorry—I misunderstood your question.  We would bear, for example, through the discount window the risk of lending in yen and euro.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is clarifying a misunderstanding and explaining an aspect that is still being worked out.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 84.
  Obviously, the collateral would be in dollars, and the foreign exchange risk would be— MR. LACKER. Obviously, it is a lending risk.  But before you do the loan, you swap with the foreign central bank. The way we do it now, the foreign central bank bears the currency risk, and in this one, we would.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, disagrees with the statement made before him by using the phrase "But before you do the loan." He suggests an alternative approach by mentioning swapping with the foreign central bank. This indicates a disagreement or differing perspective on how to manage the currency risk.


Passage number 85.
   MR. SHEETS. That’s right. The way that works is, when we do that swap, we agree to unwind that swap at the exchange rate that prevailed at the time the swap was made.  My preference in these negotiations is that, for these other swaps, we would do exactly the same thing vis-à-vis our foreign central bank counterparties.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It simply explains the preference of Mr. Sheets in negotiations.


Passage number 86.
 MR. LACKER. To make them bear it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting information.


Passage number 87.
 MR. SHEETS. So they would still be bearing the foreign exchange risk.  But in some sense we are promising that we get back the dollars we put in and they get back the foreign currency they put in. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement followed by a clarification or confirmation-seeking question.


Passage number 88.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. It is risk in that the currency is going to be worth less in dollars, but it is not risk in that you are getting back anything different than what you actually extended.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents two different aspects of risk related to a currency.


Passage number 89.
 MR. SHEETS. Yes, that is right. In some sense, the Federal Reserve and they don’t really care because they get back their currency and we get back our currency.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the Federal Reserve and their perspective on currency.


Passage number 90.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. There’s an element of hedging here.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that there is an element of hedging present.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 91.
 MR. FISHER. Well, actually, President Evans asked one of the questions that I was going to ask. Mine is a lot more generic, of Trish:  To what degree do you sense that this credit default swap market is helping or hindering efficient markets and the equilibration of these distortions that we are seeing. Because there is some debate about this.  I am talking about the speculative CDS positions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The mention of "debate" and the phrase "there is some debate about this" suggest that there is contention or disagreement regarding the impact of the credit default swap market on efficient markets and distortions.


Passage number 92.
 MS. MOSSER. My view is that the credit default swap market has taken a lot of abuse for many things that would have happened even if it didn’t exist.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker shares their own perspective on the credit default swap market and suggests that it has received blame for events that would have occurred regardless of its existence.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 93.
 MR. FISHER. So is it exacerbating.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. This is indicated by the word "exacerbating," which suggests that there is a disagreement or conflict occurring.


Passage number 94.
  MS. MOSSER. There have been a few times, certainly, that the peculiarities of the structure of the CDS market have led to more-volatile changes in spreads from one day to the next. But, quite honestly, it is a more liquid market.  It probably gives you a truer price signal for the vast majority of credits out there, particularly large corporations, both financial and nonfinancial, than the corporate bond market does.  When market liquidity goes away and it is harder to discern fundamental movements in asset prices, the less liquid market—and that is definitely corporate bonds—gives you the worst signal, and the CDS market probably gives you a better signal. Given the size of the CDS market, the rapidity with which it grew, the size to which it grew, and the fact that it is a little the dog that didn’t bark and that there were certainly problems with the Lehman bankruptcy and a lot of technical issues, my view is that, frankly, it has been one of the markets that has continued to function—not wonderfully, but it still functions—and some liquidity is still there.  Others may have a slightly different view, but that has been our experience.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Mosser, expresses her opinion and acknowledges that others may have a slightly different view, but there is no direct disagreement or argument presented within the passage.


Passage number 95.
 MR. FISHER. That actually is the basis of my question.  The point is whether we are getting good information from the CDS spreads, not a distorted version.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MR. FISHER is asking a question about the reliability of information obtained from CDS spreads.


Passage number 96.
 MS. MOSSER. I think they are probably less distorted—certainly in the case of corporates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents a statement without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 97.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements that express disagreement or contention. It simply expresses gratitude.


Passage number 98.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 99.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, since we are beginning the year, a broad appeal to speak to the furthest person in the room rather than to the person next to you.  [Laughter] It is very hard to follow many of these answers because I can’t hear you down at thisend of the table, and I can imagine our colleagues here in the back of the room have no idea what is being discussed. A couple of questions. It is probably a little premature to be thinking in this detail, but the institution that Nathan described I think we can all guess because of their foreign operations.  They have funding needs in many, many currencies.  Charlie, can you hear me at the end of the table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making a comment about the difficulty of hearing the other participants in the room and expressing a desire for clarity.


Passage number 100.
 [Laughter] MR. EVANS. I can. I was just trying to guess whom you were talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their ability to guess whom the other person is referring to.


Passage number 101.
  MR. LOCKHART. Would we be using hard currency swap facilities to deal with softer currency funding problems when the crisis could begin in a minor currency.  Is there that kind of linkage conceivably in how we structure and address this.  That is the first question.  The second question is, If this is an institution for which we have already had an intervention with a significant and very public amount of money involved, would we be offsetting this against that intervention facility, or is this incremental.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It simply asks two questions seeking clarification or possible scenarios regarding the use of currency swap facilities and funding problems during a crisis.


Passage number 102.
 MR. SHEETS. On the first question, you are absolutely correct that this particular institution does have significant foreign-currency funding needs in some of the minor Asian currencies, for example, and has experienced stresses in those.  I think that is an issue that we would need to ponder as to how to proceed on, and it was in the back of my mind in the sense that in our presentation we emphasized euro, yen, sterling, and Swiss francs.  Suppose it is a minor Asian currency.  Would we want to think about swap lines with some minor central bank to allow them to have that currency, or is getting them yen enough.  Given market differences, time zones, and everything else, is getting them yen going to be sufficient to be able to provide the funding in some of the other Asian currencies. Those are issues that we are going to have to spend a fair amount of time thinking hard about.  I think maybe the second question is more for New York.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging a valid point and considering additional factors to be discussed.


Passage number 103.
 MS. MOSSER. I don’t think we are nearly far enough along in this process, nor have we spoken in sufficient detail to either our bank supervisory or our discount window colleagues to make that judgment, frankly.  At this point, the fact that I know is that quite a significant amount of collateral is posted within the Federal Reserve System at the discount window that is not currently being borrowed against.  That is, honestly, probably as much as we can say at this stage. But, clearly, that would be a set of conversations we would have to have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is stating their opinion and the lack of information on the matter. There is no disagreement or contention present in this passage.


Passage number 104.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you. I’m happy to kick off our first go-round in this format.  Obviously, we established a new interest rate regime at the last meeting and have some knotty  issues—a lot of challenges—ahead of us.  I want to borrow a bit of time from my remarks later in the meeting and use them here, if I could.  I respect your appeal for disorganized interaction, but I have organized my thoughts.  [Laughter] I am happy to give a disorganized version, if you would like, but— PARTICIPANT. How do we tell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking if they can borrow time to share their thoughts, and another participant jokingly asks how they would be able to tell if the speaker gave a disorganized version of their thoughts.


Passage number 105.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. I think, in principle, that we agree that it would be better to have all of this done by the Treasury.  I think we have to accept political realities, prioritize, and try to address the most important issues first and see how far we can get. On Treasuries versus other purchases, I don’t want to get deeply into it, but any kind of model without perfect, complete markets has to recognize the existence of liquidity premiums, which can differ across markets and which affect the effect of a given amount of demand on a purchase of a given asset. So it isn’t evident that applying our purchasing power on assets where markets are deep and liquid and liquidity premiums are low would have the same effect as on other markets where liquidity premiums are high.  But I am just addressing that there is a reason that it is not a purely neutral operation.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the idea that it would be better for the Treasury to handle a certain task. They then go on to discuss different considerations and factors that might affect the effectiveness of purchasing assets in different markets. However, there is no direct disagreement or contention.


Passage number 106.
 MR. LACKER. I don’t want to go deeply into technical details either, but a certain presumption with regard to credit risk is that there are potentially adverse consequences of distorting relative credit risks across markets.  I don’t see why the same thing shouldn’t apply to liquidity risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and stating that they don't see any reason why the same concept shouldn't apply to liquidity risk.


Passage number 107.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The term "Vice Chairman" by itself does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply refers to a specific position or title within an organization.


Passage number 108.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I would say that the markets are already distorted.  We are starting from a point of the market not in equilibrium in the sense of normal long-time  functioning. We are starting with markets that are very out of joint relative to where they have been historically. So to say that you are distorting markets by the intervention, in fact we are actually trying to push markets back to something closer toward normality. About your point whether there is a market failure in the securitization market, I think there is absolutely a market failure in the securitization market, and you basically cited what it was. The very fact that securitization rates are well above the rates that the banks would demand to hold it on their own balance sheet tells you that the market is fundamentally broken down.  It is certainly true that those particular banks that you cited may not be balance sheet constrained, but the banking system as a whole is clearly balance sheet constrained.  What the TALF does is basically provide balance sheet capacity to the private sector that the banking system today cannot provide. Also, even if the ABS market is functional for those two banks that you note, there are a whole bunch of other problem areas in the securitization market that the TALF could be used to address in the future.  For example, the commercial real estate market is an area about which lots of people have been coming to us and saying, “We are going to have a real problem refinancing the commercial mortgage loans that come due in 2009 because there is no balance sheet capacity in the commercial banking sector.” So although it may be true for the two particular banks that you described, I don’t think it is true for the banking system as a whole.  I think that the TALF can address a real market failure because it provides a number of things that the market can’t get right now, which are balance sheet capacity, protection against downside risk, and term funding.  Those three things are not available in the market right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Throughout the passage, the author provides explanations and examples to support their argument that there is a market failure in the securitization market and that the TALF can address this failure. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 109.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher, you had a two-handed intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, there is evident disagreement or contention as indicated by the phrase "two-handed intervention." The person addressed as "President Fisher" seems to have faced criticism or opposition from at least two individuals or groups.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 110.
   MR. FISHER. I do want just to jump in.  I thought your response was appropriate and correct, and obviously ultimately we would like to put as much of this back to the Treasury as possible. The ultimate objective is to insulate ourselves as a central bank as much as possible from political pressures, so we can do what central bankers do.  I might also add as much as possible from market pressures, but that is another matter.  But I disagree with the point made— and I agree with the staff conclusion—with regard to the purchase of Treasuries.  It strikes me that there is enormous fear in the marketplace about the potential for open-ended stimulus in fiscal policy and there is great concern that we will acquiesce by monetizing fiscal policy.  I am very reluctant to go down that road.  That strikes me as one of the strongest arguments that the staff made.  At any rate, at this point I don’t think it is necessary.  Rates are quite low as they are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, disagrees with the staff conclusion regarding the purchase of Treasuries. He expresses his reluctance to go down the road of monetizing fiscal policy and argues against it, disagreeing with the staff's position.


Passage number 111.
  I disagree, Jeffrey, in ideal market situations, as the Vice Chairman just pointed out—whatever you are of this Committee— [laughter]  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I am still trying to figure that out myself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear instance of contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges that there was laughter after mentioning Jeffrey but does not express disagreement with anyone or anything.


Passage number 112.
   MR. FISHER. As one of our many Vice Chairmen pointed out, this is a highly distorted market, and I would suggest—I was listening to what you said—in fact, the effort may lower Treasury rates at the price of raising other rates that you might crowd out perversely by supporting the Treasury market at this juncture.  So I would support the staff’s recommendations. Because we have so many things on the table, I did have a question with regard to Brian’s point. That is, when would we consider closing a facility.  As long as we have these different facilities open—and we haven’t shoved everything over to the Treasury—might it not send a good signal to the market—and I know President Plosser is probably going to talk about this a little, too, because we talked about it at lunch, just to be open—to close down one of these facilities that was not being utilized.  For example, the AMLF or the MMIFF—all of these  “initialisms” are getting confusing—if they are not active, do we want to give to all of them the same time extension.  That is my question.  Now, you might respond that we don’t know yet but they might be utilized.  I haven’t read through the specifics of your language proposition, but might we not at least make it clear that, if we feel that we have leeway, we could close down any one of these facilities while we extend their ultimate maturity.  So the real question is, Can we find something that we might actually close to demonstrate that we don’t just have an open-ended book, until we reach the point that you wish to reach, Mr. Chairman, as you articulated and as President Lacker argued, where we shove this onto the Treasury.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 113.
 MR. MADIGAN. I think that general principle is right.  In fact, in the open market area we have wound down one program—the long-term RPs.  But right now I think that simply extending the facilities does not mean that they will necessarily be in place for the entire period of time.  The FOMC and the Board could evaluate, as time goes on, whether these programs are needed. I do think that closing down any of these programs at this time does run the risk of sending a signal that you think you are pretty far along in this process and you are going to start closing things down relatively quickly.  So I think it carries a risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that the general principle of extending the facilities is right, but also expresses concern about closing down any of the programs too quickly. Overall, the speaker seems to agree with the idea of extending the facilities but wants to remain cautious.


Passage number 114.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Trish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 115.
 MS. MOSSER. For what it is worth, I think that the signal to markets of closing even the dormant facilities, given my obvious view about how fragile things are, could actually have a pretty serious, significant, adverse effect, even though they are not being used.  They are viewed very much—particularly the two facilities you mentioned and particularly the MMIFF—as a backstop. We don’t need it now. It is not priced attractively, frankly, given the spreads in markets.  But should we go through another period, heaven forbid, like September and October, it would be used, according to market participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Mosser, argues that closing the dormant facilities could have a negative impact on the markets, while acknowledging that they are not currently being used and are not priced attractively. This suggests that there may be differing viewpoints on the necessity and potential consequences of closing these facilities.


Passage number 116.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser has been very patient.  May I turn to you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply acknowledging President Plosser's patient nature.


Passage number 117.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, you had a quick two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 118.
  MR. LACKER. In the interest of your interest in informal exchange, I was interested in responding to our new Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is expressing his interest in responding to the new Vice Chairman's informal exchange.


Passage number 119.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The word "Okay" is a simple acknowledgement or affirmation and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 120.
 MR. LACKER. I don’t understand in what sense the observation that prices are low and that quantities are very low constitutes a demonstration that the consumer-backed ABS market is broken down. Can you think of a model in which that results.  Yes, demand is low, and supply is elastic. I sketched out one. What we are talking about, it is important to remember here, is the interaction, the rivalry, between the balance sheet channel of credit flows and the securitization channel. A broad array of contractual features are important to the relative attractiveness for market participants of those two channels—covenants, risk allocation, regulatory and accounting treatments, and the like.  On balance sheet constraints—would some firms prefer that the demand for securitization be higher, high enough that securitization was less costly for them than holding it on balance sheet.  Yes, I am sure that is true.  But if that is the criterion for whether or not a market is broken down, then it is hard to see the difference between a market being broken down and just regulatory capture in some broad sense. You talked about markets being distorted already.  I can picture information constraints, verification costs, asymmetries, and the like that would lead market outcomes to be less felicitous for all concerned than they otherwise would be.  But, yes, information constraints constrain achievable outcomes, but so do technology constraints.  Would we be better off if we could get more output with the same amount of labor and capital.  Yes, we would.  But I don’t think you would call the market distorted because that is the case. The question is why it is distorted.  If you come to me with a model—with some story, not even a model—that sketches out the interaction of information with technologies and with   market participants’ incentives that convinces me that markets are distorted in a way that government intervention can remedy, I am all ears, and I would be happy to talk about it.  I have been asking for that for a year and a half. I have been even doing the work for you.  I have been even bringing models to the table.  I haven’t gotten any information or any market observations that seem consistent with one story or another.  I am not sure that this request has been taken seriously. So, yes, if markets are distorted by something or other, fine, but that is hardly an answer for justifying the TALF in my view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows disagreement or contention between Mr. Lacker and the speaker. Mr. Lacker is questioning the speaker's assertion that the consumer-backed ABS market is broken down based on low prices and quantities. He argues that low demand and elastic supply could be a reason for this, and questions whether the market is truly broken down or if it is just a case of regulatory capture. The speaker does not provide a convincing explanation, leading Mr. Lacker to criticize the lack of evidence or market observations supporting the need for government intervention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 121.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I guess this deserves an answer. [Laughter] Well, first of all, I think we have a fundamental disagreement about how we are looking at the current set of events. I think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium, not an equilibrium.  You are looking for models that describe equilibrium outcomes, and I think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium caused by the massive deleveraging of the nonbank balance sheet.  As that process unfolds, we are not where your model wants to describe. Number two, what we are observing is well outside the realm of historical experience.  So I think that to be able to produce a model that describes what we are seeing is very, very difficult because we have never been here before.  We are just generating the empirical data now to develop the model that we can actually test.  In terms of this issue—is the securitization market evidence of market failure.—I think my example is just a very simple one.  The fact that the bank, as you describe it, would rather hold these assets on its balance sheet than securitize them and AAA yields are higher than the net return to the bank of holding them on its balance sheet is telling you that there is a lack of arbitrage between the bank market and the nonbank market.I think fundamentally we have a disagreement about what the process is that we are describing. You say, “Show me a model.”  I certainly want to see your model that describes what has happened over the past 18 months because I think it is very, very difficult to show that model as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker and the person they are addressing have a fundamental disagreement about how to analyze the current set of events. The speaker believes they are in a disequilibrium caused by deleveraging, while the other person is looking for models that describe equilibrium outcomes.


Passage number 122.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I am going to regret this, but I am going to ask you a question. [Laughter]  Do you think the United States economy is at a Pareto efficient point at this moment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a simple statement expressing regret about asking a question and then posing a question about the state of the United States economy.


Passage number 123.
 MR. LACKER. Probably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply gives their opinion or assumption without any contradictory statements.


Passage number 124.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. With the best position we can be at right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "With the best position we can be at right now" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the current position is the best available.


Passage number 125.
 MR. LACKER. Roughly speaking. All constraints taken on board. PARTICIPANT. What was the question again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It seems to be a conversation where one person is seeking clarification on a question that was previously asked by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 126.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The question was, Is the United States economy at a Pareto efficient point at this moment.  And the answer was “yes.”  Okay. So that is obviously a different view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not suggest any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that the answer to the question is "yes" and acknowledges that this is a different view than what was previously discussed.


Passage number 127.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes, that is a fundamental basis of the disagreement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The statement does not express any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


Passage number 128.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: "Okay" is a simple acknowledgement or agreement, and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 129.
 MR. EVANS. May I ask an information question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show contention or disagreement. It is a simple request for information.


Passage number 130.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The question does not provide a passage to analyze and determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 131.
 MR. EVANS. President Lacker alluded to two banks that funded their operations at a very low rate.  Was that with the FDIC senior guarantee on their debt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 132.
 MR. LACKER. One of them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 133.
 MR. EVANS. That is a distortion that is helping them, right.  I am running into that when I talk to a lot of people.  I will come back to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans is simply expressing a point of view or observation about a distortion that is helping "them," without specifying who "they" are or providing any opposing statements. The passage does not indicate any direct disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 134.
  MR. LACKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions "MR. LACKER" without providing any information or context about his activities or opinions to suggest any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 135.
 I am fine with that, but— MR. EVANS. Well, that is a distortion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker says they are fine with something, but Mr. Evans immediately counters with "Well, that is a distortion." This implies disagreement or contradiction between the two speakers.


Passage number 136.
 MR. LACKER. That is a government intervention.  Are we intervening to make securitization just as subsidized as bank balance sheets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about government intervention and poses a question.


Passage number 137.
 MR. EVANS. Our problem is that there is one distortion here, and then there is something else, and then they don’t offset or they do offset, and people are inside or they are not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage provides a description of a situation and does not contain any indications of contention or disagreement. It simply presents a problem and some contrasting elements without suggesting conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 138.
 MR. LACKER. If we are in a world of second best, I understand that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement expressing understanding.


Passage number 139.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. We are in that world.  We definitely are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a factual statement without any opposition or conflict.


Passage number 140.
 MR. LACKER. Well, then, what is it that unfairly tilts the playing field toward bank balance sheets.  I mean, you have this regulatory tax, and it tilts in the other direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question about what unfairly tilts the playing field towards bank balance sheets and mentions the existence of a regulatory tax that tilts in the opposite direction.


Passage number 141.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. You are exactly right that historically the securitization market has had elements of regulatory arbitrage. I think that is true. But I think, in this particular case, it is not really the reason that AAA ABS assets are still selling at such high yields right now. The reason that they are selling at high yields right now is that the borrowers who would love to invest in these assets on a leveraged basis can’t get leverage.  Their inability to get leverage is being driven by the balance sheet constraints of the dealer and bank community, which is a disequilibrium event caused by their historically large mark-to-market losses and loan-loss provisions, which are depleting their capital and constraining their ability to lend.  So this is a disequilibrium.  Five years from now, we won’t be here, and banks will have the ability to lend, they will be able to lend on AAA assets on a leveraged based, and AAA yields will be much lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents a sequence of explanations without contradicting or challenging any previous statements.


Passage number 142.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let me just say in response to President Plosser, I should tell everyone that, assuming that we extend these programs and the swaps, we will not announce anything until Thursday morning because we want to coordinate with the foreign central banks.  Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 143.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage is not provided, therefore it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 144.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, first of all, obviously, please keep it confidential.  But could I ask the Board and the New York staff to have at least a discussion about the two programs that President Plosser mentioned, the GSE approval and the AMLF.  I think I would propose to extend the AMLF today as part of the package, but the Board would have the ability to reverse that tomorrow by notation vote if we decide that we get some kind of support.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making a request for the Board and New York staff to discuss two programs, the GSE approval and the AMLF. They also suggest extending the AMLF as part of the package, but acknowledge that it can be reversed if necessary.


Passage number 145.
 MR. PLOSSER. The AMLF is not the FOMC; it is the Board.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is a statement by Mr. Plosser, discussing the difference between the AMLF and the FOMC. There is no obvious contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 146.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I understand that, but what I am saying is that I am hearing what you are saying, and I think we ought to look at that particular program.  We have to be a little careful because we don’t have a lot of advance time here. But we should look at that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not show contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges understanding the previous statement and expresses a desire to review a specific program while also mentioning the need for caution due to time constraints.


Passage number 147.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Plosser is thanking the Chairman, indicating agreement or support rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 148.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states President Lacker's name and suggests that he acted quickly in some unmentioned context, but there is no indication of any conflicting opinions or disagreement.


Passage number 149.
 MR. LACKER. Just real quickly.  Disequilibrium, in this context, is a non sequitur.  It is a conversation stopper. It is like appealing to astrology—it is the equivalent of that.  If we are out of equilibrium, what happens out of equilibrium.  What is determining what happens.  People make choices on their way to making adjustments.  They were in equilibrium when they made the choices that resulted in the losses, and now that equilibrium is playing out, obviously.  Would these leveraged borrowers like there to be a greater demand for their liabilities.  Yes. This all looks as though demand is low.  I will ask you a question.  The buggy whip industry—is that sector broken.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and making a comparison to support their argument, but there is no disagreement with any other party.


Passage number 150.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage states the title and name of Chairman Bernanke, but does not provide any information about his actions or opinions. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 151.
 President Hoenig, on that note—   MR. HOENIG. Oh, wow. [Laughter] Only 45 minutes later.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The interruption by President Hoenig with the exclamation "Oh, wow" and laughter suggests a casual and light-hearted atmosphere, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention between the speakers.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 152.
 MR. LOCKHART. Can you answer the buggy whip question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the phrase "Can you answer the buggy whip question." The use of the word "can" implies doubt or uncertainty about the person's ability to answer the question, suggesting a potential disagreement or dispute.


Passage number 153.
  [Laughter] MR. HOENIG. I have heard that story, and I don’t need to review it again.  I have just a couple of things that I want to comment on here.  First of all, I do appreciate this, because we are thinking about where we are and we are thinking about how we might exit this, even though we have a lot of turmoil ahead of us.  That much I appreciate.  I think that part of President Lacker’s point and the Vice Chairman’s point may be that we are in an adjustment process.  We are deleveraging like crazy in this economy.  That resulted from an excess at an earlier point, and we are going to find a new equilibrium.  That is the process we are going through, and it is very difficult. Much of what we have done I wish had been done in the Treasury to begin with.  I still think that would have been the right call.  But it wasn’t, so we are where we are.  How do we get where we are going, and how do we do this transition.  What we have are these facilities, and I hope that we use them temporarily.  I hope we do take advantage of working with the Treasury to move as much of it out as we can.  Some of it is self-liquidating, and I think we will get out of it. But some of it is not, and that is the part I would like to be able to push toward the Treasury, and that would be part of our plan. I would also say that I am reluctant to go with long-term Treasuries, not because I don’t necessarily agree with some of what you are saying but because I am worried about some of the consequences of the perception that we are directly funding the Treasury and monetizing debt immediately.  I want to think that through before I get on that bandwagon, given where we have already come at this point. To change just a bit, Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about the TARP and the future as we go forward, as you have these discussions coming up.  I think there is no confidence in it.  It has  been inequitably administered across the United States, and that is why you have such bitterness about it. So in looking forward, we have an opportunity to do that better.  The way we outline how we are going to deal with financial institutions and banks in the future is extremely important now.  I want to thank Nathan for the summary report on the Swedish experience or the Nordic model and so forth because, as we talk about aggregator banks or RTCs or some approach to the problem, I think that is a very good model to look at.  It offers us opportunities to deal with this problem as it gets worse because I think the problems across a broader base of banks are getting worse.  Commercial real estate is now feeling a little pressure.  I think we are beginning to see a turn in agriculture again and a turn related to energy.  These problems are going to become more difficult, and how we go forward with the next iteration—and I wouldn’t call it the TARP any longer—of this banking problem is important. One thing that I have some disagreement with regarding Nathan’s conclusions is whether we have the mechanisms to do a kind of Swedish model, given the more-complex institutions and the size of this country. But I suggest that we do.  We have a cadre of experienced people across the United States—in the Comptroller’s office, the FDIC’s office, and the Federal Reserve’s offices—so that when this comes, if we think about it now and plan, we can begin to say which banks should be looked at. Part of the problem with the last issue of the TARP was that we went in and looked at a lot of these institutions and they were on the margin.  But we were changing the criteria as we went along instead of having the criteria set and going in and looking at these institutions.  Which ones are solvent at the moment, and for which ones would capital help maintain solvency.  You can’t have any guarantees on this, given the trends in the economy.  But we ought to have a systematic, equitably applied solution for the next wave that is coming our way.  That would be very important to have set up because it would help keep a lot of commercial real estate loans off our balance sheets.  If we handle the next section as we have the past around asset-backed securities, we are going to have a lot more assets on our balance sheet, and that does worry me.  So that is something for us to think about going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their thoughts, ideas, and concerns, without directly addressing or contradicting any other viewpoints.


Passage number 154.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "President Rosengren" does not indicate contention or disagreement on its own. It is simply addressing someone in a respectful manner.


Passage number 155.
 MR. ROSENGREN. First of all, Mr. Chairman, I agree with your prioritization that, to the extent possible, it makes sense for the programs that have substantial credit risk to be borne by the Treasury. Obviously certain circumstances forced other decisions along the way, but I think that is a good prioritization.  Then the second prioritization is that ideally we would be focused on markets and not individual names, and that’s consistent with moving the Maiden Lane facilities over to the Treasury to the extent possible.  I think both of those prioritizations make sense. On the AMLF, I actually was roughly at the same point in November, and its size has come down since then.  It has been interesting.  I have had a number of discussions with a variety of mutual funds about winding down the AMLF.  They don’t view the AMLF as being the same animal as the other money market facility, and I have been told that it will take severe duress before they use the other facility because they are worried about stigmatizing themselves.  As for the AMLF, because it is the sale of asset-backed securities, there is not the same stigma attached. So actually we had $800 million come in today.  It was a money market fund that has experienced very substantial runoffs that are not occurring with other organizations.  I have been told that, even if it goes down to a small number, money market funds’ willingness not to hold extensive cash balances or very short term maturities is, in part, due to the fact that they can liquidate their positions in asset-backed securities relatively quickly.  The AMLF is not ideally   structured—I definitely agree with that—but I am not sure that the other facilities are perfect substitutes. If we were not to extend it, I would want to do that only after some discussion with a number of money market fund families because I think we might find that it would have an effect on their willingness (a) to hold asset-backed commercial paper and (b) to hold a variety of other assets. I think that they would look for other ways to get much more liquid because, as has been highlighted, the financial markets are very fragile.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement with the chairman's prioritizations and discusses the AMLF without disagreeing with anyone.


Passage number 156.
 MR. PLOSSER. May I just ask about that. The asset-backed paper that actually comes through the AMLF, is it mostly commercial paper.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a question and does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 157.
 MR. ROSENGREN. It is all asset-backed commercial paper.  It’s all A1/P1 asset-backed commercial paper.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that all the commercial paper is asset-backed.


Passage number 158.
 MR. PLOSSER. So they could also sell that into our commercial paper facility, could they not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of possibility or suggestion.


Passage number 159.
 MR. ROSENGREN. They are not issuers.  This is a money market fund.  The commercial paper facility is for issuers of commercial paper.  The AMLF is for money market funds. So they are not the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement differentiating between a money market fund and the commercial paper facility and AMLF.


Passage number 160.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. The issuer, in principle, could buy it back from the money market fund and then potentially issue into the CPFF, but that is not an obligation that the issuer would necessarily have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the issuer has the potential option to buy back from the money market fund and potentially issue into the CPFF, but it is not a necessary obligation for the issuer.


Passage number 161.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not have any contention or disagreement. It simply indicates that someone named Mr. Plosser is expressing gratitude.


Passage number 162.
 MR. ROSENGREN. There has been an unwillingness to do that actually.  It has been the experience of the money market funds. In a more general sense, I think that, since the end of the third quarter, we have been in a situation in which both the securitization market has broken down and bank balance sheets are quite constrained, which is why we have seen spreads that are very, very large.  I do think that the various short-term credit facilities that we have established have both brought the spread down and brought more liquidity to the market more generally.  So in a general context, those facilities have been quite beneficial. I have just a couple of short comments.  First, in the earlier presentation, I noted that tangible common equity was highlighted in the slides, and I would say that a lot of our programs have been tied to preferred equity, and the markets, Moody’s, and the rating agencies are focused on tangible equity. So whatever we do going forward, I think we need to spend a lot more time thinking about tangible common equity because we are seeing in supervision presentations that institutions that have substantial excess capital by regulatory ratios are also sometimes institutions that the market is running away from because, when they do the tangible equity calculation, it’s a problem.  So we ought to give a little more thought to common shares going forward. Second, I come out in a different place related to our purchase of mortgage-backed securities and GSEs. Mortgage rates have been around 6 percent for a year and a half.  After the announcement of the program, they went down to 5 percent.  The housing market has been the epicenter of this problem.  It is a problem both for the housing market and for financial institutions. Rather than cutting back on that program, if we are trying to have an effect on borrowing costs that affect the economy, that program would be the one I would expand.  I would expand that program and not do Treasury securities because Treasury securities are the one asset that everybody wants to buy now. So I am not sure that we have to get in line with everybody else to buy the same thing that everybody else wants and push down a rate that is already low. The problem is not that Treasury securities are too high.  The problem is that everything else is high relative to Treasury securities.  So if we want to lower borrowing costs, that is exactly what some of these facilities are designed to do, and that is what I think we need to do. So I am supportive of doing more actually for the mortgage market, and that is for discussion tomorrow. The TALF is of the same nature, and I think it actually is quite beneficial.  I would hope that we could get it operational as quickly as possible.  I know that dealing with accountants, lawyers, and others becomes very complicated, but I think that the sooner we get that up and running, the better. I do question whether the size is going to be appropriate if we really want to have a significant effect. We are going to have to look at both the size of that facility and the assets that we are thinking about—particularly the CMBS market that was alluded to.  It is designed to deal primarily with original issuers of these securities.  Another question that is similar to the problem asset—for holders of those securities, you could have a TALF-like program that deals with people who are holding those assets rather than issuing those assets.  That gets more at the financial institutions’ issues rather than at the issuers’ issues, but I think that is another program that we should at least think about as an alternative.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinions and suggestions about certain programs and policies, but there is no direct opposition or disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 163.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage mentioned does not provide enough context or information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 164.
 MR. PLOSSER. I agree with you, President Rosengren, about the objective of trying to lower the spread on the MBS, and the mortgage market is important.  However, another way of expressing one of my concerns is that, as we continue to focus on one asset class at a time— mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed credit card debt, auto loans—I worry that we are gradually being drawn into an ever-wider array of private credit markets and private asset classes and instruments that we will just gradually expand.  Where is the limit to this, and how do we  define what those limits are. How do we decide what the criteria are that constitute something important enough for us to intervene in that way.  I see this creep broadening our balance sheet in ever-greater dimensions in these private credit markets.  I worry that, in its doing so, the implication is that, almost in a negative feedback loop, each market is going to become dysfunctional by something so that it will drag us in.  My desire is to have better objective criteria that help us decide when it is appropriate and when it is not, because I think that we are just going down a slope here that is broadening the scope, which is not helpful for the institution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Plosser expresses his concern about the Federal Reserve's expanding involvement in various private credit markets. He questions where the limit to this expansion is and argues for better objective criteria to determine when intervention is appropriate. This suggests a disagreement or contention between Mr. Plosser and those who advocate for the continued expansion of the Federal Reserve's involvement in private credit markets.


Passage number 165.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser, we do have a shadow value on our balance sheet constraint, right. So we do have limits to what we can do, and so we have to make choices about where the impact will be most effective and where it will be the best for the economy.  Vice Chairman Dudley and then President Rosengren, and then I am going to go without hesitation to President Evans, who has been waiting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging the existence of a constraint and highlighting the need to make choices based on its limitations.


Passage number 166.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. There is a presumption in President Plosser’s remarks and President Lacker’s remarks earlier that, if we intervene in one market, we are going to make these other markets that are adjacent to those markets somehow worse.  In fact, we have seen in several cases that it actually does not work that way.  It works in just the opposite way. One good example is the commercial paper market in which the A2/P2 market has actually improved probably in part because of the commercial paper funding facility’s taking some of the strain off the commercial paper market.  So it might work that way sometimes, and improving one market may make another market worse.  But it also may be that improving the function of one market by providing balance sheet eases the aggregate balance sheet constraint, which then leads to improvement in other, adjacent markets.  So it is not necessarily true that doing something in one market makes other markets in which we are not intervening worse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not present any clear contention or disagreement. It discusses different perspectives and possibilities without taking a definitive stance.


Passage number 167.
 MR. LACKER. If I may just comment on that, the important thing is to keep track of what sort of thought experiment you have in mind. A sterilized intervention, or an intervention in which you are intervening in a market and comparing that with intervening more broadly in Treasuries, is one thing. Another thing is an intervention that is unsterilized and that does not pull some other assets out of the market.  I would just point to Ms. Mosser’s presentation, which she opened with characterizing markets as that rates in markets in which we have intervened have broadly improved and rates in markets in which we have not intervened have broadly deteriorated. To me that has the flavor of consistency with the notion that our issue of liabilities and sale of Treasuries is pulling funds out of other markets and increasing rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply providing his perspective and opinion on the topic being discussed.


Passage number 168.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But did they deteriorate because of our intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement asking whether "they" deteriorated because of "our" intervention.


Passage number 169.
 MR. LACKER. We have to fund it somehow, and the funding is going to pull money from somebody, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply acknowledges that the funding for something will have to come from somewhere, which is a factual statement rather than a point of disagreement.


Passage number 170.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Did they deteriorate because of our intervention, or did they deteriorate because the macroeconomy was deteriorating at a very rapid rate.  I would argue that they deteriorated because the macroeconomy was deteriorating at a very rapid rate, not because of our intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The author clearly states their belief that the deterioration was due to the rapid decline in the macroeconomy, rather than the intervention.


Passage number 171.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren—quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about President Rosengren's stance on a particular issue or any potential arguments or disagreements within the passage.


Passage number 172.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Just very quickly, in terms of the allocation, housing is an interest-sensitive component of GDP. Every time we change interest rates, we are in effect going to have an impact on housing, and it is going to be disproportionately borne by housing than other sectors of the economy because of its interest-sensitivity.  I view what we are doing with the MBS and GSEs as dealing with the one area that we can actually change.  I think it is going to have a much bigger effect.  In the Greenbook charts that we will be looking at tomorrow, if we   had a fed funds rate that we could lower, I do not doubt that we would be lowering the fed funds rate if we had that possibility. We don’t have that possibility.  So we have to look to an alternative asset. Where is the biggest bang for the buck.  It’s probably in housing right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement expressing the speaker's opinion about housing being an interest-sensitive component of GDP and the potential impact of changing interest rates on the housing sector.


Passage number 173.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from an individual named President Evans.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 174.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will just make a couple of comments based on the discussion today. When it comes to the TALF, I find that I am of two minds.  I do think it will ultimately be useful for deploying important central bank liquidity in an attempt to provide more-accommodative conditions.  But I am concerned that we are picking winners throughout this process. When you mention that we are going to consider CMBS, I am reminded of the fellow who came to my office and gave me a presentation.  He owns shopping malls, and last fall he desperately needed funding and still does, but they are not worth very much at the moment.  He wanted a program like this, but it wasn’t available—I do not know that it was, anyway.  I have also received phone calls from heavy equipment manufacturers in my District.  I know you have gotten a letter from at least one of them about their finance company financing.  For them the issue is that they are unlucky enough not to have a thrift through the OTS.  So they cannot get the FDIC unsecured-funding temporary guarantee on that, and their assets cannot be funded that way. There are some competitors that have access to this, and they have done very well, and others that haven’t. As we get into this allocation type of decisionmaking, I am not quite sure how we are going about doing it. Is CMBS selected because it is an important market that we need to keep functioning or because it is going to have a particular macroeconomic effect that is beneficial.  How does that compare with other sectors and whether they are on our radar screen or not.  Maybe that was the right decision, but when we select certain types of asset-backed securities to buy—it is just very difficult.   I also want to agree with many of the comments that President Plosser made with regard to the programs that we have.  The briefing today was very helpful in describing the various programs.  I think we need some additional metrics along the lines of just routine types of statistics so that we can see and have a better idea.  Your familiarity is very great with these, and ours is not as great. I have to admit, as I look at it more, I find that, although I am very concerned about exit strategy in general, at the moment our balance sheet doesn’t worry me quite so much. Finally, I want to applaud your comments at the beginning, Mr. Chairman, about discussions with the Treasury and that we, as best we can be, should be allergic to any attempts to use our balance sheet for long-term financing.  I think that is exactly right.  I wish you all the best for all of us. [Laughter] I have tried to grapple with the very vague discussions of aggregator banks, and when I talk to academics, they do not always help me because they resist the fact that public funds are going to be put into this—they think that it really should be something that public funding is not a part of. If you pick a very large number that is required to take assets off the balance sheet of banks—I do not know what the number is, but it is in trillions—and then you think about how the Treasury is going to fund this, the only way they can do that is by issuing Treasury bonds.  Ms. Mosser was talking about how $150 billion puts strains on yields.  I think you very quickly come to our balance sheet and how we are able to leverage up, and it even makes sense— because why do the gross funding through bonds when it is really a net kind of funding against assets. So it makes a lot of sense, but it causes a lot of trouble.  I hope that I am wrong in thinking about that and that there are very easy ways out of it.  But those are some of our concerns, and they will be very important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses concern about the selection process for asset-backed securities and the allocation of funding, as well as the potential long-term financing of the balance sheet. They also express skepticism about using public funds for aggregator banks.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 175.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I certainly agree that you cannot trust academics.  [Laughter] President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, President Lockhart, is making a statement that they agree with the idea that academics cannot be trusted. The laughter indicates a level of disagreement or differing opinions among the audience.


Passage number 176.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a couple of curiosity questions really for the staff. If we were to convey assets to the Treasury and mark them to market at that time, let us say, Maiden Lane or AIG, what losses would we be recognizing at that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked by Mr. Lockhart for clarification purposes.


Passage number 177.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we have a mark-to-market loss on the Bear Stearns assets in Maiden Lane I. We don’t have mark-to-market losses in anything else.  What would be ideal would be to work out some arrangement.  It would take some accounting work, but at Maiden Lane I, we have a letter from the Treasury saying that the Treasury will bear those losses through seigniorage, and there should be some way to arrange an asset called future reductions of seigniorage or something like that that would make us whole.  I think that those things can be worked through, but obviously there is a lot of technical work to be done on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply describing a situation and expressing their thoughts on how it could potentially be resolved.


Passage number 178.
 MR. LOCKHART. The second question—nobody has mentioned any particular markets on our radar screen that, if we had criteria, we might intervene in.  But the one on which I get feedback is the municipal market, and we have a legal issue that we cannot lend to municipalities unless they happen to be corporations. Presuming for the moment that there was some legislative treatment of that, what is the status in discussing with the Treasury an intervention in that particular market.  It is a broken market as far as I can tell at this stage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily stating a position and discussing a potential intervention in the municipal market.


Passage number 179.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That has not come up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 180.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I would say that the market is not doing well, but it is doing better than it was a month ago.  So it is improving, but I am not aware of the Treasury having this on the front burner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 181.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The fiscal package has a great deal of money for states and localities, which would probably be the primary source of support for those.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply provides information about the fiscal package and its allocation of money for states and localities as a potential source of support for them.


Passage number 182.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. In principle, you could set up an SPV that the municipality issued out of. That would be the corporate entity that we would lend to.  You could do that, but it is not clear whether this problem isn’t going to gradually resolve itself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a possibility and mentioning that it's unclear if the problem will resolve itself gradually.


Passage number 183.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I do want to pick up on what President Evans and President Rosengren said, which is that I think it is possible to set criteria, but there is a constraint on how much we can do in terms of both size and duration and, of course, limits on credit risk.  Given those constraints, we have to make choices.  Although I do not think that this is actually science here, I do think we can try to think about, for example, interest-sensitive sectors or sectors in which our interventions will have particularly strong effects on liquidity premiums and the like.  So it is not science, but I do think there is a sense in which we can make those choices and in which we are constrained. But I recognize that this is a whole new field. I would make the comment that I have had recent conversations with foreign leaders, including Prime Minister Brown—all of whom said that the Federal Reserve is leading the way.  The United Kingdom is undertaking these programs.  Japan is undertaking these programs.  It is becoming a new approach.  When you hit zero, you have to think about other ways to affect the economy, and so at least in that respect we are not the outlier anymore.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing the limitations and choices regarding economic interventions, but there is no explicit contention or disagreement.


Passage number 184.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you. A lot of ground has been covered, and I do not want to rehash things that have already been said. In general, I would just associate myself with President Rosengren’s remarks and say that, with respect to choices that we have to make, I very much agree with the idea that a focus on mortgage-backed security markets is something that can be effective, is working, and deserves priority.  I also want to support the point that Bill Dudleyand others have made about commercial-mortgage-backed securities and the notion that this is something that was announced in connection with the TALF, that we were studying the possibility of extending this facility to commercial-mortgage-backed securities.  We have been following this quite closely, and I would like to agree with the points that Bill made about this. This seems to me like something that could be the next very serious problem for the banking system and for property prices in general.  There is huge rollover risk here, where we have hundreds of billions of dollars of loans that are coming due on commercial properties for which the underwriting was originally pretty solid.  I am very concerned that the underlying economics is now deteriorating largely because of the economy, and banks obviously have very high concentrations. A lot of banks in this area are very loath to lend.  The commercial-mortgage-backed securities market seems to be completely dead.  I am really very concerned that, without the ability to refinance these loans, we are going to have properties dumped on the market and we will begin to see exactly the same thing happen with commercial real estate that we are seeing with housing.  It could lead to a further wave of unnecessary bank failures.  So although I am sensitive to the idea that, yes, we are making decisions about what sectors are deserving or are of priority in terms of credit allocations and there are counterarguments against our doing that, we do have choices to make, and I would focus a lot of serious attention on proceeding in that area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 185.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let me turn to Governor Kohn and then take a coffee break.  Then we can continue if people are so inclined.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they will turn to Governor Kohn and then take a coffee break before continuing if others are interested.


Passage number 186.
 MR. KOHN. Just a few quick points, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with those who say that it is very uncomfortable picking which markets to intervene in.  I wish we weren’t here, but we are.  I just do not see an alternative to it.  I think we have been here since August ’07 really, when balance sheets constraints—people were hoarding capital and liquidity—impaired the arbitrage among markets, and central banks had to use their balance sheets to step between private parties increasingly to take risks where the public was not willing to take risks.  Now governments are going to have to step in to spend where the public isn’t willing to spend.  So we have this withdrawal from risk-taking, this hoarding of capital, not spending, and the government’s role here is to step into that breach to keep the economy from shrinking even further.  Arbitrage is broken. I think there are balance sheet constraints.  Jeff’s banks in the Richmond District may say that they have not changed criteria, but certainly the answers to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey suggest that banks in other Districts have tightened terms and standards for making consumer loans. It is really hard to judge which markets, I agree.  I think they should be important markets with systemic effects and ones where our intervention can make a difference.  It is really hard to say ahead of time, but we ought to be looking for those.  I agree that we need to be thinking about exit strategies and balance sheet constraints, but I sure hope we do not put emphasis on that. I think our problem right now, given where we are, is not how we are going to get out of this but how we can ameliorate the decline in the economy.  The more we talk about how we want to get out and the constraints, the less effective our policies will be.  I think that is what happened to Japan. The Japanese central bank kept talking about how they did not really want to be here, they could not wait till they got out, this was uncomfortable, and they did not want to be doing this. I think it undermined that aspect of the credibility of what the central bank was doing. So you are right. We need to have this conversation internally.  We need to keep three chess moves ahead in what we are doing.  But I wouldn’t want worries about the size of our   balance sheet and our exit strategies to importantly constrain our ability to make a difference in credit markets going forward. On the buying of Treasuries, I would keep that on the table.  I think rates are already low, as President Rosengren and others have pointed out.  We do not really need to intervene there, whereas for mortgage-backed securities I think the interest rate risk is low because some of us might argue that those rates were too high relative to Treasuries and we are not taking the same kind of risk buying at that low price versus the high price that we might be with a Treasury.  But it is not really about the risk on our balance sheet.  It is about the effects we can have.  Those rates are already low. I do not think we need to buy Treasuries at this point.  I would keep that option on the table to see what happens to those rates going forward and where we think we can be most effective. In terms of worries about monetizing the debt, here I do agree with President Lacker.  I think this is about inflation and inflation expectations.  We are, I hope, going to take some steps to make our inflation objectives a little clearer tomorrow.  I think we need to keep that in mind, and we should not have to worry about people accusing us of monetizing the debt.  We should keep our focus on the macroeconomic variables. Finally, on transparency, we have started up, as the Chairman said, a little working group to see what more we can do. We are concentrating in part on the collateral side.  Can we say more about collateral without impairing the functionality of our windows.  We are thinking about things we might add and publish quarterly instead of weekly and whether there is more we could do on that basis. Any suggestions that Reserve Banks have would be gratefully received.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is agreeing with the points made by others and expressing their own opinions on various topics.


Passage number 187.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Why don’t we take a coffee break until 4:30, and then if anyone else would like to enter in when we come back, that would be fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting taking a coffee break until 4:30 and leaving the option open for others to join when they come back.


Passage number 188.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Let’s resume.  I do not want to cut anyone off. Would anyone else like to comment.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply giving others the opportunity to share their comments without interruption.


Passage number 189.
 MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am going to play the role of provocateur here and ask a couple of questions that are in the spirit of having a wide-ranging and strategic discussion, as we are having here.  Here is something that people said to me recently.  This is a question for Mr. Sheets about swap lines, one of our favorite topics.  Here is the statement: These swap lines are giving control of the U.S. monetary base to foreign governments, especially through persistent and large usage by the foreign central banks.  I will stop on that one and see what you think about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they want to provoke a discussion and ask a question about swap lines. They then present a statement that someone said to them and ask for the opinion of Mr. Sheets.


Passage number 190.
 MR. SHEETS. In each one of the disbursements under these lines, the Federal Reserve and the FOMC have the prerogative to determine whether or not it is in our interest to go forward with the swaps.  So I think that we maintain a crucial governance role.  If we come to the conclusion that at some point the costs of this program or the costs of extending that dollar liquidity outweigh the benefits, then we can start winding up the program.  So I don’t think that is right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating the speaker's opinion and explaining their perspective on the matter. There is no direct contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 191.
 MR. BULLARD. So what is the magnitude right now of the swap lines that are outstanding.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for information.


Passage number 192.
 MR. SHEETS. The total outstandings are around $465 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is a straightforward fact about the total outstandings being approximately $465 billion. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 193.
 MR. BULLARD. Okay. So a scenario would be that you go over the next five years, with zero nominal interest rates and an ongoing financial crisis, and these things stay out there   because of needs for dollar funding in Europe.  Now you had a permanent one-time increase of, say, $500 billion in the monetary base. Isn’t this what we are looking at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting a hypothetical scenario and asking a question.


Passage number 194.
 MR. SHEETS. Well, for what it is worth, our forecasts of the European economy and European interest rates are not consistent with that scenario. Market expectations are not consistent with that scenario.  I hope that is not what we are looking at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their hope that the scenario described is not accurate based on their forecasts and market expectations.


Passage number 195.
 MR. BULLARD. Okay. I am just trying to ask a series of provocative questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not indicating any contention or disagreement. The speaker explicitly states that they are asking provocative questions, which may spark debate or thought but not necessarily result in disagreement.


Passage number 196.
 MR. SHEETS. You are doing a good job.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Sheets, is complementing someone for doing a good job.


Passage number 197.
 MR. BULLARD. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The phrase "Thank you" does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 198.
 [Laughter] MS. MOSSER. May I add one parenthetical point to that.  The swaps—unlike the TALF, for example—are priced at a penalty to market rates, and to the extent that market spreads do come down, as we have seen in the past two months, swap lines do self-liquidate.  They have declined very noticeably—they were nearly $600 billion at one point.  As the spreads come in, effectively the private sector comes in and undercuts the central bank, which was by design.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply provides information about the pricing and self-liquidation of swaps, as well as the decline in swap lines.


Passage number 199.
 MR. BULLARD. Okay. Thank you. So now I am going to try to reconcile Presidents Lacker and Rosengren [laughter] and get your and our new Vice Chairman Dudley’s reactions. My experience in economics is that it is not that helpful to talk about equilibrium and disequilibrium. So I am going to talk about it in a different way.  You have firms and people who do the best they can, given the constraints that they face.  There are frictions out there, and we know what the friction is here.  It is a very severe information friction in certain financial markets.  It is a crisis of financial engineering in which, when the new financial instruments were created, they were thought to be good devices, but they turned out to have serious transparency issues and that created information problems.  So now you say that, given that friction, I am going to let everybody optimize.  Jeff will say, well, that is a Pareto optimum given the friction and, if there is nothing you can do about the friction, then that is the best you can do.  But if there is some policy you can do to ameliorate the friction and pull that out, you will get a better solution. I would say that that is Mr. Dudley’s position.  The position that it is just technology and there is probably nothing we can do about the crisis in financial engineering would be the Lacker position. I was wondering if you guys would react to that and see if that reflects your views.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different perspectives and asking for reactions, but there is no direct disagreement or arguments between the individuals mentioned.


Passage number 200.
 MR. LACKER. I will say “yes,” [laughter] with the additional note that with that answer alone you might wonder why I get so exercised, but it is that withdrawing that friction does not seem to be what any of our programs have been designed to accomplish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 201.
 MR. BULLARD. Yes, and I agree with that. There seem to be a lot of things that are being done in many parts of the government and maybe parts of the Fed that are not really getting at that information friction.  So I am going to ask the most provocative question of all.  The Chairman said at the beginning that we should obviously be allergic to taking on credit risk, and normally, I think everyone here agrees with that.  But maybe now is the time to rethink that.  You have a serious information problem out there.  You have a lot of reactions to that that are tangential to the core problem, and we are talking about doing open market operations, which used to be always in Treasuries, now in MBS. It would not be that hard to say let’s just do the open market operation swap of money for a financial instrument using the toxic assets that are such a problem in this economy.  Normally I would not say things like this, so I am stepping out of character. But in the interest of provoking discussion, maybe now is the time to at least start thinking about something like that.  That would get to the heart of the matter.  If you try to go through the Congress, they are wonderful people and everything, but the process gets politicized—and we know this; we are seeing that already—and so all kinds of other things get  done. This would get at the core of the problem.  You would be taking on risk, but you take on some interest rate risk even when you buy Treasuries.  The whole idea would be to price these at the right price, which I understand is very tricky, but who better to do it than the 500 economists that hang out at the Fed.  So I don’t know—should it necessarily be a 100 percent benchmark that we do not want to take on credit risk, or should it be only a 95 percent benchmark or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion of a potential policy approach and the speaker is presenting their own viewpoint and suggesting it as a possible option for consideration.


Passage number 202.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let me say something about these frictions and why we can affect them.  There are two frictions that I think are important.  One of them relates to the friction of illiquidity.  It is a tradition of central banking that we lend against illiquid assets when there is a panic run, and we know that panic runs are equilibrium phenomena and they can occur even though the assets are worth more than the liabilities.  I would argue that that kind of phenomenon has generalized into a lot of aspects of our economy—for example, the funding of various kinds of off-balance-sheet instruments, the commercial paper market, the money market mutual funds, and lots of other vehicles—and a lot of what we are doing is very much consistent in spirit with the idea of providing backup liquidity to allow firms to meet redemption demands without having to sell off assets into illiquid markets.  I think that is the thrust of a lot of what we are trying to do. The other type of friction that I think is important has to do with information capital.  There is a sense in which the capital of the banking system is the most important wealth in the world because it supports the information gathering and other institutional activities that banks can do. When, for whatever reason, there is a loss of bank capital and their activities are restrained and they are not able to make full use of the information and other skills that they have; that is a problem.  I would argue that in a world where there are other frictions—sticky  prices or wages, for example—the inability of the banks to fully use their information capital to extend credit and make loans and make markets will lead to a bad outcome for the economy as a whole. The intellectual argument then is that there is a social benefit, a social externality, to providing more capital, and that is what a lot of the TARP and these other things involve. Now, traditionally in your comment about credit, it is not easy to make a clear distinction.  There is always the issue of liquidity versus solvency and so on, but it is not easy to make a clear distinction between lending against solvent but illiquid assets versus providing capital for informationally intensive agents, like banks.  So that line is not completely clear.  But by history and tradition, the central bank has always leaned toward liquidity provision.  The government has always leaned toward credit allocation.  I think that is a distinction that is worth trying to preserve, although admittedly we are not always going to do it perfectly.  So I think we can specify what the frictions are, make coherent sense of them, and try to explain how our actions are related to them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily a statement expressing the author's perspective on the importance of addressing frictions related to illiquidity and information capital in the economy, and how actions such as providing backup liquidity and capital can help mitigate these frictions. The author also acknowledges that making a clear distinction between lending against illiquid assets and providing capital for informationally intensive agents (like banks) can be challenging, but suggests that leaning towards liquidity provision and credit allocation is a distinction worth preserving.


Passage number 203.
 MR. BULLARD. We do not want to maintain that if it is going to send us into an even more prolonged downturn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not present any explicit contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is expressing a concern or caution about a potential negative outcome, but there is no direct disagreement or conflicting opinion mentioned.


Passage number 204.
 I mean, it might be nice if we always did liquidity and Treasury always did credit, but I am saying— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we have taken on credit risk in emergency situations, as you know. But as I promised at the beginning, I think to the extent that we can use the opportunity of a new Administration and so on to clarify responsibilities in a better way, then we ought to do so. I think we all appreciate what an extraordinary situation we are in and have experienced for the last eighteen months.  A lot of what we are doing is requiring our good sense and historical knowledge and our intuition.  But as I think maybe the Vice Chairman mentioned,  we do not really have the historical basis for all of the things that we are having to deal with here. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 205.
 MR. LACKER. Mr. Chairman, thank you.  That was a very clear and lucid description of what the core crystallized issues are regarding frictions—regarding the thing that in my fogged state I was not able to articulate to Vice Chairman Dudley a minute ago.  This is what I think we have been struggling to get our hands around, and so I appreciate your clear articulation of that. As you know, these are sort of classic problems in banking economics.  About liquidity, I am struck by the hedge funds.  To date as far as I know—maybe New York knows about one that is about to blow up—we have not been challenged by them.  Here is a set of participants not viewed as likely to benefit from the safety net that, over the past couple of years, have structured their liabilities in a way that makes them relatively insulated from run-like phenomena.  That illustrates the broader point about models of panic-stricken runs—the extent to which you issue a contract that makes you vulnerable to that is endogenous and leads me toward wondering if the safety net has really been what is driving the instances of run-like behavior not only in the banking system. On informational capital, I think you are right on target there. Obviously, it was the subject of your very seminal research, inspiring to all of us.  There I think about a lot of the pulling away—people taking their loan accounts—from Wachovia and Governor Duke’s bank a year ago telling me that they were picking up customers that were uncomfortable working with Wachovia or B of A. Switching costs are there for sure.  But I struggle with how hard they are and, again, appreciate that you have crystallized genuine scientific issues to clarify the discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing appreciation and agreement with the Chairman's clear articulation of the core issues being discussed.


Passage number 206.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The passage simply expresses gratitude towards "President Stern" but does not present any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 207.
   MR. STERN. Well, I was just going to comment on Jeff’s comment.  I think the hedge fund industry for the most part has weathered this remarkably well, but of course, the five biggest hedge funds, Goldman, Merrill, et cetera, et cetera, are gone.  What is left is a good deal smaller and presumably a lot less consequential than the ones we have seen. Let me just add, Mr. Chairman, that I agree 100 percent with what you just said.  We have long had a system in which the commercial banking system has been a backup source of liquidity to other financial institutions and the nonfinancial sector as well.  For a variety of reasons, partially because of what has happened to capital and partially because the shadow banking system is growing so rapidly relative to the banking system, even though I would say banks in the aggregate are continuing to play that role, it has become increasingly difficult for them to function effectively as the backup source of liquidity.  I think that is an important justification for the actions we have taken.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the comment made by Jeff and the chairman, and also provides additional information supporting their statements.


Passage number 208.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Lockhart.


Passage number 209.
 MR. LOCKHART. Just to respond, Jeff, to the comment that the hedge funds haven’t faced a run-like phenomenon. One of my contact conversations with a hedge fund manager effectively said, “We are in a run.  This period is a run.”  It is a run that has episodes at the end of quarters and so forth, so it operates a bit differently, but the effect is the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, is providing a response to a comment and agrees with the statement that hedge funds are currently experiencing a run-like phenomenon. He even shares a conversation with a hedge fund manager who confirms this perspective.


Passage number 210.
 MR. LACKER. Well, if I could, Mr. Chairman, just to be clear—it is not that they are not subject to runs; it is that runs don’t bring them down the way an institution like a classic bank in 1932 would have been brought down by a retail run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply clarifies a point about the impact of runs on non-classic banks.


Passage number 211.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. As you point out, an important point is that institutional structures, contracts, and so on are endogenous, and policy affects them.  But we are in a situation at this point where past is past and what is sunk is sunk.  We have to deal with the  situation. And it is very, very important for us to go forward to try to change the legal structure, the regulatory structure, and even Federal Reserve operating procedures in ways that will encourage more-stable systems in the future.  But at the moment, the fire is burning, and we have to think about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges the importance of past events and the need to deal with the current situation, but also highlights the importance of making changes to prevent similar issues in the future.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 212.
 MR. LACKER. If I could, that is a very important insight.  It is part of the classic tension between healing now versus looking at what we are doing as part of a repeatable process from which people are going to be forming expectations about our future behavior.  That is the inevitable tension.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions a "classic tension" between healing now and considering future behavior. This implies a disagreement or conflict between the two approaches.


Passage number 213.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, that is right. All right. Unless there is anyone else, let me thank you for a very useful discussion.  I am sure that we will have more in the future, but this really sets the parameters and the issues.  I took many things away from this discussion.  One of them is that we need to keep thinking about our metrics regarding the efficiency and efficacy of our programs—in particular, how the shadow value of duration or illiquidity in our balance sheet is matched against the benefits of a particular program that has certain implications for our balance sheet. I would challenge the staff—as all the hard tasks go to the staff—to think more about how we can evaluate the efficacy of our programs, in particular, and the opportunity costs as well, in terms of the space they take up or the duration that we create in our balance sheet.  One useful exercise that we ought to be thinking about is, if we were to go another step, where would it be and on what criteria would it be decided.  That would perhaps answer the question about there being no plan, no control, and no delimiting factors.  I think that we can make progress on trying to answer these questions.  It is not going to happen immediately, but I hope over time it will help.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing the discussion and expressing the need for further evaluation and thinking about program efficacy and balance sheet implications.


Passage number 214.
  MR. LACKER. I have a request, Mr. Chairman.  I asked the System Open Market Account manager a couple of days ago, but now he is not the manager anymore.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a change in position or role.


Passage number 215.
  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I did that on purpose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is likely referring to something they did intentionally for comedic effect, resulting in laughter. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 216.
 MR. LACKER. You just didn’t want to do it.  Tomorrow or maybe today we will hear about a forecast for the path of the federal funds rate.  In creating that, it is endogenous.  It depends on the economy, but it also affects the economy.  I was wondering if we could get one for our balance sheet, subject to uncertainty of all the obvious kinds.  It would be useful to help us think about the capacity of programs and extending them.  I think it would be useful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing a desire for a forecast for the balance sheet, emphasizing its usefulness in assessing the capacity of programs and their potential extension.


Passage number 217.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I agree with that, and I thought we would have done more of that today, in fact. But what we can do—and what we ought to think about for future reference—is maybe scenarios as opposed to forecasts.  That might be a better way to think about it. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 218.
 MR. PLOSSER. I was going to ask exactly the same question.  So thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is expressing gratitude for someone else having asked a question that he was planning to ask.


Passage number 219.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right.  If we are ready, we still have some votes to take here. Let me first ask the FOMC to do the routine ratification of domestic open market operations. Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that there are still votes to be taken and asking for a motion from the FOMC to ratify domestic open market operations.


Passage number 220.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 221.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any discussion.  All in favor. PARTICIPANTS.  Aye.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The word "Participants" suggests that everyone is in agreement with the statement. The word "Aye" further confirms this, as it usually indicates agreement or approval.


Passage number 222.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Opposed.  Hearing no objection, thank you.  All right. Now, to approve the extension of the programs, I would like to propose that we extend the list of programs through October 30, as proposed by the staff.  We should have some discussion about the AMLF and others, recognizing that, even if we announce an extension, rationalization down   the road or restructuring is always a possibility.  So this would be a motion for the Board to extend the 13(3) programs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply proposing to extend the list of programs and suggesting that there may be future changes or restructuring.


Passage number 223.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions someone's name and states to move.


Passage number 224.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All Board members okay with this.  All right.  Hearing no objection, thank you. We need from the FOMC a resolution to extend the swap arrangements through October 30. A motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It indicates unanimous agreement and consensus among the Board members.


Passage number 225.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Instead, it appears to be a simple statement or instruction.


Passage number 226.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Further comments or discussion.  Any.  All right. Any objections.  Not hearing any objections, the motion is approved.  We need a separate resolution from the FOMC to extend the TSLF through October 30.  Motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The statements are requests for comments, objections, and approval.


Passage number 227.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting or contradictory statements. It is a statement made by Mr. Kohn, but it does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 228.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any concerns, objections, or comments.  Hearing no objections, thank you. All right. Let me remind you again that this is all confidential until Thursday morning because we want to coordinate our announcements with other central banks, and we will take the opportunity to at least look at the two programs that President Plosser mentioned. Let me turn now to the economic situation.  Boy, I think it has been a while since we were three and a half hours into the meeting before we got to the staff forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage consists of a series of statements and reminders about coordinating announcements and discussing the economic situation. There is no indication of any concern, objection, or disagreement among the speakers.


Passage number 229.
 MR. STOCKTON. The GDP is a little smaller than it was at the start of the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact about the GDP being smaller than it was at the start of the meeting.


Passage number 230.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Actually I do not want to give President Lacker any concerns about whom he is listening to.  So I want to introduce Dan Sichel, Karen Dynan, and Trevor Reeve, who will be presenting the outlook.  Dan.   2 The materials used by Mr. Sichel, Ms. Dynan, and Mr. Reeve are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply introducing the individuals who will be presenting the outlook and mentioning that their materials are attached to the transcript.


Passage number 231.
 MR. SICHEL.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the material labeled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook.”  The incoming data largely have ratified the bleak near-term outlook we projected in the December Greenbook; the spending data have painted a gloomy picture, and readings on employment and production were even weaker than we had expected.  Starting first with the employment data, the top left panel of exhibit 1 shows the dramatic worsening of the labor market in recent months.  Private payrolls declined almost 520,000 per month on average in the fourth quarter. The panel to the right shows manufacturing industrial production excluding motor vehicles.  Factory output has been plummeting as manufacturers are responding aggressively to declines in both domestic and foreign demand. The motor vehicle sector has been hit particularly hard.  With extremely sluggish sales, automakers have been slashing production—plotted in the middle left panel—and we anticipate a sizable further reduction in assemblies this quarter. Turning to households, the latest data confirm that consumers continue to retrench. As shown by the blue bars, real PCE for goods other than motor vehicles appears headed for a very large drop in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate a further decline this quarter. These projections are similar to those in the last Greenbook.  In the housing sector, starts (the black line in the bottom left panel) declined further last month and now are less than one-quarter of their peak level in 2006.  With the level of permits (the red line) still below starts, we expect further declines in starts in the next few months.  All told, as shown to the right, we project that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of about 5 percent last quarter.  Given the greater weakness in the employment and production data, we have lowered our forecast for the first-quarter change in real GDP to minus 5½ percent. In the second quarter, the rate of decline in real GDP moderates as the new fiscal package—discussed more in a minute—boosts demand. The top left panel of exhibit 2 summarizes the medium-term outlook for real activity.  We anticipate that recovery will begin, albeit slowly, in the second half of this year, with real GDP projected to increase at an annual rate of about 2 percent; next year, output is expected to rise about 2½ percent.  The box to the right lists key factors contributing to the onset of recovery:  Financial stress begins to recede, housing begins to stabilize, monetary and fiscal stimulus provide a boost to demand, and inventory liquidation comes to an end.  Regarding fiscal stimulus, although the precise composition of what will be passed remains a moving target, we now assume a package of $800 billion, $300 billion more than what we penciled into the December Greenbook.  The larger size of the package is an important source of our slightly stronger outlook for economic growth than in the last Greenbook.  The bullets in the middle left panel highlight our estimates of the response to the various provisions of the plan. Households begin spending the tax cuts of $180 billion and transfers of $90 billion when received.  On the other hand, we expect the investment response to the business tax cuts to be limited.  In addition, of the total new funding for state and local governments, we project that only 40 percent will be spent by the end of 2010 as infrastructure projects take some time to get under way and as the spending of other grants is smoothed out somewhat.   The panel to the right puts the pieces together.  We estimate that the fiscal package will boost real GDP growth by a bit less than 1½ percentage points this year and almost 1 percentage point next year.  Our estimates of the GDP effects are smaller than those of some other analysts, with the discrepancy mostly reflecting our assumption of slower spend-out rates by state and local governments.  Inventory dynamics—the subject of the bottom panels—are another element importantly shaping the recession and recovery.  The table in the bottom left reports the contributions of inventories to real GDP growth in key periods over the business cycle. The first column shows the contributions in the current episode, and the second column shows averages for the postwar period.  As can be seen on line 1, in the year before the peak in real GDP in 2008:Q2, inventories were already being liquidated aggressively, in contrast to the usual positive contribution.  As shown on line 2 of the table, from the peak to the trough, inventories hold down real GDP growth only a little. Because inventory liquidation was already quite rapid before the peak, once the contraction in sales got under way, the rate of liquidation needed to steepen only a bit more.  In contrast, during many past episodes, the drag from inventories was much larger as manufacturers had to play catch-up once sales turned down. In the year after the trough (line 3 of the table) liquidation comes to an end, and the swing in inventories boosts real GDP growth 1 percentage point, about in line with historical averages.  This increase in the inventory contribution is an important feature of the projected recovery in real GDP.  Karen will now discuss developments shaping the outlook for households and businesses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a factual presentation of economic data and projections.


Passage number 232.
 MR. MADIGAN.3  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections.”  Exhibit 1 depicts the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2009 to 2011 and over the longer run, following the integrated approach to the inclusion of longer-run projections that was recommended by the Subcommittee on Communications and discussed at the December FOMC meeting. The likely severity of the current recession is clearly evident in this exhibit:  Nearly all of you expect real GDP to shrink this year, the unemployment rate to climb to at least 8½ percent by the fourth quarter, and total PCE inflation to be less than 1 percent on a fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter basis. This figure also highlights your expectations that a period of three years is likely to be insufficient for the economy to return to a balanced-growth path following the current economic shock.  Indeed, although the benchmark horizon for the longer-run projections was specified as about five to six years, several of you noted that the convergence process might well take even longer than that. Exhibit 2 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your latest projections; corresponding information about the Committee’s previous projections—those from last October—is indicated in italics, and Greenbook projections are included as a memo item.  As shown in the left column of the top panel, your forecasts for real GDP growth in 2009 have a central tendency of minus 1¼ to minus ½ percent, as most of you expect output to contract further during the first half of this year—at an annual rate of about 3 to 4 percent—before resuming positive growth, albeit at a low rate, during the second half. Moreover, you generally anticipate a relatively sluggish recovery that reflects the gradual waning of financial stresses, continued weakness in the housing sector, and poor growth prospects abroad.  As a result, most of you seeGDP growth as only gradually reaching a faster pace that eventually brings the economy back to its balanced-growth path.  Nearly all of you estimate that real GDP will grow over the longer run (the right-hand column) at an annual rate of 2½ to 2¾ percent. The central tendency of these longer-run growth projections is the same as for the trial run that was conducted last October. As shown in the second panel, your forecasts of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 fall in a range of 8 to 9¼ percent, more than a percentage point higher than for the projections that you made last October.  In explaining these revisions to your near-term outlook, many of you pointed to the weakness of incoming data on consumer spending and labor market conditions and to the rapid slowdown in global economic activity.  Your unemployment projections further ahead also underscore the anticipated slow pace of recovery:  Most of you expect that, even in 2011, the unemployment rate will be about 6¾ to 7½ percent, well above your estimates of about 4¾ to 5 percent for the unemployment rate that will prevail over the longer run in the absence of further shocks.  Your longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have the same central tendency as in October. Your forecasts for inflation in 2009 have also shifted markedly since last October.  Your forecasts for overall PCE inflation in 2009 (the first column of the third panel) now have a central tendency of 0.3 to 1 percent, a full percentage point lower than the central tendency of your October projections; and most of you now expect a core PCE inflation rate of about 1 percent this year (the first column of the bottom panel), compared with the central tendency of 1½ to 2 percent for your October projections. Looking further ahead, the width of the central tendencies and ranges of your inflation projections has increased considerably.  For example, the range of your overall PCE inflation projections for 2011 spans an interval of nearly 2 percentage points—about twice as wide as the range of your projections last October.  From your accompanying narratives, it is evident that these differences reflect the diversity of your views about the pace of economic recovery, the sensitivity of inflation to economic activity, the prevalence of downward nominal wage rigidity, and the degree to which you see longer-run inflation expectations as likely to remain firmly anchored over the next several years.  Many of you anticipate that inflation in 2011 will still be well below your individual assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate—that is, the longer-run rate of inflation that each of you sees as most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate for promoting price stability and maximum employment.  Your assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate have a central tendency of about 1¾ to 2 percent and a range of 1½ to 2 percent.  This central tendency is noticeably higher than in October; at that time, your assessments were tightly clustered around a value of 1¾ percent, whereas 2 percent is now the median and the mode of the distribution. In your forecast submissions, many of you indicated that your views regarding the appropriate path of monetary policy are roughly similar to those of the Greenbook, which assumes that the federal funds rate will remain close to the zero bound through  late 2012. However, a number of you noted that policy tightening would commence  somewhat sooner than that, and a couple of you expressed the view that the federal  funds rate will need to be raised substantially above current levels during the second  half of this year.  Exhibit 3 presents your views on the risks and uncertainties in the outlook.  As  shown in the top left-hand panel, all of you see uncertainty about growth as elevated  relative to historical norms; and as shown to the right, most of you continue to  perceive the risks to growth as weighted to the downside, even with the downward  revision in your modal projections.  In the accompanying narratives, many of you  emphasized the uncertainties in gauging the evolution and implications of the global  financial turmoil, the effects of nontraditional monetary policy tools, and the size and  effect of the fiscal stimulus package.  As shown in the bottom left-hand panel, nearly all of you see an elevated degree  of uncertainty about the inflation outlook. As shown to the right, a majority view the  risks to that outlook as roughly balanced, whereas the rest of you see the risks as  tilted to the downside. Some of you noted that the degree of uncertainty about the  inflation outlook reflects uncertainty about the evolution of resource slack and the  path of commodity prices, which are highly sensitive to global economic conditions.  Others mentioned that the risks to the inflation outlook could eventually become tilted  to the upside if stimulative policy measures are not unwound in a timely fashion once  the economy begins to recover.  As you know, your agenda reserves time for a decision tomorrow as to whether to  proceed with regular publication of longer-run projections.  You may wish to indicate  your general views on that issue in the economic go-round. As usual, the staff will be  preparing a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and will be circulating drafts to  you over the next few weeks along with drafts of the minutes.  Should you decide to  proceed with longer-term projections, these projections from this cycle would be  included in the SEP to be released along with the minutes of this meeting in mid- February. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is giving a summary of the participants' economic projections.


Passage number 233.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Do we have questions for the staff.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply consists of a statement of gratitude and a request for possible questions. The mention of President Plosser does not indicate any disagreement.


Passage number 234.
 MR. PLOSSER. I have a few questions, two really short ones—just clarifying ones—and two longer ones. On the presentation, I have a question on exhibit 7, the recovery across different recessions. I note that you say you started it at the second quarter of ’08 as being the trough. Everything else starts that at the NBER trough, which would have been the fourth quarter of ’07. Why did you do that and not do it elsewhere.  Is there any reason for it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question seeking clarification on a specific detail.


Passage number 235.
   MR. SICHEL. You could do these types of cyclical comparison charts either way, dating from the NBER peak or dating from the series-specific peak.  What is done here is to index to the series-specific peak so that you look at each of the path cycles and say when GDP turned down in that cycle. In many cycles, that is the same as the NBER peak, but in some cycles it is not.  In this cycle, in particular, it came a couple of quarters later.  You could do it the other way—in which case you would see the red line rising first and then coming down.  It is just a different way of presenting the same information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting different options for how to analyze and present the data.


Passage number 236.
 MR. PLOSSER. I was just curious what the rationale for using that peak in some cases, but in other parts of the presentation you used the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 237.
 MR. SICHEL. Arguably, it really just comes down to that it is a different way of presenting the same information.  You get a cleaner comparison because every business cycle has some unique features and the timing differs in some particular ways.  This is trying to abstract from those differences in timing.  But one could do it the other way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not presenting any form of contention or disagreement. It is explaining that there are different ways of presenting information and highlighting that this specific approach aims to abstract from differences in timing. There is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 238.
 MR. PLOSSER. The second clarifying question—I’m curious about tightening standards on consumer loans, particularly credit cards, in exhibit 4.  When you asked a banker in the survey about tightening credit card lending, how am I supposed to interpret that.  Does that mean that they have reduced physically or technically the credit limits on credit cards.  Does it mean that they are offering fewer credit cards.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question about the interpretation of a survey on tightening credit card lending standards.


Passage number 239.
 MS. DYNAN. Brian can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe it is more the latter— offering fewer credit cards.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not hint at any disagreement or contention. It simply mentions that Brian can correct the speaker if she is incorrect about something.


Passage number 240.
 MR. PLOSSER. It has been great that I get much fewer requests to apply for credit cards.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Mr. Plosser is a positive one, indicating that he receives fewer requests to apply for credit cards, implying that he may have had negative experiences or inconveniences in the past.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 241.
 [Laughter]MS. DYNAN. We have asked separately about what they are doing to credit lines.  In fact, more than half are saying that they are reducing credit lines as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is contention or disagreement because more than half of the respondents are reducing credit lines, which suggests that some financial institutions may have a different approach or opinion on the matter.


Passage number 242.
 MR. PLOSSER. I guess the issue there for me is, if they are reducing excess credit lines—for example, on credit cards that were not being exercised anyway—or just not offering as many cards, how I interpret that in terms of really tightening credit is a bit loose there compared with some other things.  So I just wanted some clarification. Now, I have two more-substantive questions.  First, about inflation forecasting:  The best way I can describe forecasting in this environment is guesswork, and certainly my staff and I have struggled with the inflation forecast. In a lot of models, the approach to inflation forecasting both depends on and is very sensitive to varying degrees of incorporating forward-looking expectations and how much looking backward you do.  In this environment, when you have big swings up and down in inflation, looking backward may or may not be very helpful or very good. It also depends a lot on how much credibility you think the central bank has.  It is further complicated because we are at the zero bound, and that is difficult to incorporate into the models. So I would like a little discussion from you about how you came up with your forecast for inflation in this model—how much of the path that you got is really dependent on the model because, frankly, it is really hard to figure out what to do, given all those things I just mentioned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their own uncertainties and struggles with inflation forecasting and seeking clarification and discussion on the topic.


Passage number 243.
 MR. SICHEL. So I share your pain. [Laughter]  Regarding how we put this together, we are not looking at any particular model.  We are looking at a range of models and trying to make the best judgment that we can about how the various forces that affect inflation are likely to come into play over the next couple of years.  In terms of frameworks, we look at some pretty standard, backward-looking models that do not have any forward-looking components, just traditional measures of resource slack.  We also look at some forward-looking models in which   we incorporate various measures of inflation expectations to try to avail ourselves of the information in some of the survey-based measures of inflation expectations that have a more forward looking component. In terms of the factors that are particularly important for this contour, the very large amount of resource slack shown in that picture as captured by the unemployment rate—although one could measure that in many ways—is one important feature in the considerable slowdown of inflation. We think that a lot of slack will be putting downward pressure on wages and prices.  Then we add to that the movements in energy and other commodities and materials prices and the movements in import prices, which have all been quite dramatic recently in the direction of pushing inflation down. We think that all those things in terms of the forward-looking component are also going to be weighing on inflation expectations and that, as businesses and households in the economy see all of those factors and see headline inflation numbers coming down, inflation expectations themselves will be coming down some.  So we do the best we can with a range of models and try to bring the best judgment we can, and this is where we land.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different models and factors that they consider when making judgments about inflation.


Passage number 244.
 MR. PLOSSER. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The dialogue seems to be straightforward and lacks any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 245.
 I think it is very difficult MR. STOCKTON. The thing that we are having the greatest difficulty with is trying to think about the evolution of inflation expectations in this current environment, in which monetary policy has the fed funds rate pinned at zero, and that shows through in other places.  In this forecast, we are assuming that, because actual inflation is going to run as low as it is for the reasons that Dan said, there will be some downdrift in inflation expectations.  That is implicit in this forecast, maybe on the order of ½ percentage point over the next few years.  We are uncertain enough about that that we obviously wanted to show some alternative simulations because a reasonable case could be made that, in fact, we are not going to get as much downdriftin inflation expectations as we have implicitly built into this forecast.  We showed a simulation with anchored expectations running at about 2 percent, and I could see that.  Even though we have already entered a period of extreme weakness, as we showed in the briefing yesterday, the Michigan survey, with 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations, has not really shown any discernible movement yet.  We might have expected that we would already have seen that if the effect was going to be large. On the other hand, just taking a look at historical evidence on sacrifice ratios would suggest a great deal more disinflation than we have built into this forecast.  If you just used average sacrifice ratios of 4, you would come up with something similar to what we had in the deflation scenario that we showed.  Though I am skeptical about that particular sort of pure backward-looking model, I do not think you could write off the possibility that, given that we think we are going to be in an extended period of extreme weakness with large output gaps and declining price pressures coming from commodities and oil, you could see a more significant movement in inflation expectations and even lower inflation.  So we are struggling with all of the exact issues that you laid out. This is our best guess at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage regarding the evolution of inflation expectations in the current environment. The speaker mentions that there is uncertainty about the downdrift in inflation expectations and alternative simulations show different outcomes. The speaker also mentions historical evidence and their skepticism about certain models, suggesting a disagreement about the extent of potential inflation movements.


Passage number 246.
 MR. PLOSSER. So just two observations about that.  One is that we spent a lot of the past year, as we had the run-up in headline inflation due to oil on the upside, and most of us stressed the importance of anchored expectations and believed that expectations remained fairly well anchored. Consistent with that ongoing view, my outlook looked more like your “anchored inflation expectations” framework. I guess I’d also just comment that a lot of the empirical evidence on, let me call it, the new-Keynesian Phillips curves with output gaps suggests that the sensitivity of inflation to some of those gap measures is certainly not as large as the sacrifice ratio of 4 that you would put in. So I think there might be reason to diminish that effect,   particularly if you thought, as we have discussed before, that some of these shocks might, in fact, be shocks where you actually have a new, lower equilibrium.  So the gap is maybe not as large as it appears to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the personal observation and perspective of Mr. Plosser.


Passage number 247.
 MR. STOCKTON. Just to be clear:  In our forecast, we are assuming a much flatter Phillips curve than has been the traditionally estimated one and a higher sacrifice ratio.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a forecast assumption without indicating any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 248.
 MR. PLOSSER. My last question is about fiscal stimulus and your estimates there.  It is hard not to read the commentary, and there is a huge debate going on about the effects of stimulus.  Look at the empirical evidence, the theoretical evidence—the empirical work by Blanchard, and Valerie Ramey’s stuff, and you have Christina Romer’s work on the different estimates of multipliers and all that sort of stuff.  And I was curious. In the discussion, you highlighted two pieces in particular:  The first was the consumer tax cut and the debates about whether or not that is going to be saved or spent, and the second one, which I thought was somewhat more interesting, was that you thought that the business tax cuts would not have much effect. I guess I had two questions about that.  One, my reading of the empirical evidence is that those business tax cuts often do have some very short run stimulative effects, but the empirical evidence also says that large spending increases oftentimes have a negative effect on business investment.  That is where the substitution comes from.  So I just would like a little insight in terms of the model or the assessment of the pieces of this stimulus and how it plays into what you’re assuming about some of those multipliers and so forth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The passage mentions a "huge debate" and "empirical evidence" on the effects of fiscal stimulus, suggesting that there is contention or disagreement among experts. It also mentions different studies and authors with differing opinions on the topic. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, has his own questions and doubts about certain assumptions, further indicating a level of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 249.
 MR. SICHEL. To pick up on the business side of that first—we looked at the experience from the 2002–04 business tax cuts, and our best reading of that was that we just did not see much effect. In terms of the empirical work that we did, we just don’t think that there is a big kick there, perhaps particularly in a period when many businesses are in tough times and taking  losses. It just may not be enough or the right kind of thing to get them to start investing.  So our reading of the evidence is that on the business side there just will not be much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that there is not much effect or a big kick from business tax cuts in terms of stimulating investment. This contradicts the belief that business tax cuts can effectively encourage businesses to start investing.


Passage number 250.
 MR. PLOSSER. If that is true, it would suggest that the other relevant piece of evidence for this is that, if large increases in expenditures as opposed to tax cuts act as a negative on business investment, as some of the empirical evidence suggests, your forecast for business investment may be worse than what you have in your model—or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not exhibiting contention or disagreement. It is discussing the potential implications of certain evidence on a forecast for business investment.


Passage number 251.
 MR. SICHEL. I guess that channel would come through a user-cost effect on large expenditures and so on pushing up interest rates and generating crowding-out through that sort of a channel. We do have a modest increase in Treasury rates in this forecast for a variety of reasons, but we also have quite a dramatic decrease in, say, Baa bond rates and those spreads coming in during this period, when we think, as the macro risk diminishes, we are going to see some declines in credit spreads.  I think that decline in credit spreads going forward is likely to more than offset whatever forces there might be from the kind of expenditure-based crowding-out. On the household side, we are looking at the proposed tax cuts as being permanent.  We are treating them as permanent tax cuts, so we are treating those the way that we would typically treat a change in income in the usual model.  We have a marginal propensity to consume of about 0.7. We have some lags by which about 60 percent of the spending that is going to happen happens in the first year and about 85 percent by the end of the second year, and we are doing a pretty standard sort of analysis there with the types of numbers that we are getting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their analysis and assumptions regarding the impact of interest rates, credit spreads, and tax cuts on the economy. They present their views and reasoning without contradicting or disputing any previous statements.


Passage number 252.
 MR. PLOSSER. Well, the key is that you were treating them as permanent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The sentence is a statement by Mr. Plosser and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 253.
 MR. SICHEL. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The response "Yes" indicates that there is contention or disagreement in the passage. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the specific reason or topic of the disagreement.


Passage number 254.
 MR. PLOSSER. That answers the question there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that Mr. Plosser's statement answered the question.


Passage number 255.
   MR. SICHEL. We are interpreting this proposal as a down payment on a permanent change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Sichel, appears to agree with and support the proposal, interpreting it as a step towards a permanent change.


Passage number 256.
 MR. PLOSSER. Okay. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is expressing gratitude for something.


Passage number 257.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions for the staff.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there are other questions for the staff and mentions President Bullard.


Passage number 258.
 MR. BULLARD. I am comparing exhibit 3 with exhibit 6 here.  In exhibit 3 you have the middle panel on the right, “Overvaluation of Single-Family Homes,” and in exhibit 6, the middle right panel, you have “Prices of Commercial Properties.”  On exhibit 3, I guess this is a judgment call:  a reduction in home values of about 25 percent—am I reading this right.—from where they are now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply comparing two exhibits and confirming his understanding of the information presented in exhibit 3.


Passage number 259.
 MS. DYNAN. You have to remember that rents are also rising in this calculation.  But just in terms of the price component, we have seen a decline of about 15 percent so far, and we are going to see another 15 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply providing information about the decline in prices and the increase in rents. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 260.
 MR. BULLARD. Another 15 percent on homes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 261.
 MS. DYNAN. That is right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply affirms the correctness of the previous statement.


Passage number 262.
 MR. BULLARD. So I have done pictures like this, too, because I think it shows that the bubble part is out, and whatever else is remaining is overreaction, which is what you are saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is acknowledging that he has created similar pictures and agrees with the idea that the bubble has burst and the remaining reaction is an overreaction.


Passage number 263.
 MS. DYNAN. That is consistent with our view, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The speaker states that the statement is consistent with their view, indicating agreement.


Passage number 264.
 MR. BULLARD. But on commercial properties and then in exhibit 6, you have maybe a different story, a more moderated downturn there, if I am reading this right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their own interpretation or understanding of exhibit 6.


Passage number 265.
 MS. DYNAN. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: There is disagreement in the passage because someone is expressing a different viewpoint or contradicting the speaker.


Passage number 266.
 MR. BULLARD. Is there a reason that we should think commercial properties are not as susceptible to the overcorrection as housing is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a question asking for a reason or explanation, rather than expressing a specific opinion or argument.


Passage number 267.
   MS. DYNAN. We do not have a model—or we have not really found a robust model— for overvaluation of commercial property, so it has been more difficult to analyze formally.  But more generally, the reason we think that there will be such a large overcorrection on the residential side is that, with our forecast for the huge numbers of foreclosures, we think we are going to see a lot of supply dumped on the market and that it will perhaps lead sellers to aggressively cut prices. So far that has not happened in the commercial area, although we certainly think it is a risk.  We agree with President Yellen’s view that, depending on what happens in the CMBS market, it could be something that would happen.  But your reading is correct—we are not foreseeing a massive overcorrection on the commercial side at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with President Yellen's view that there is a risk of overcorrection in the commercial property market, but they are not currently foreseeing a massive overcorrection.


Passage number 268.
 MR. BULLARD. Okay. I guess I will interpret that as there might be some downside risk in this area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply stating his understanding of the situation based on the information provided.


Passage number 269.
   MS. DYNAN. For sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement acknowledging that something is certain.


Passage number 270.
 MR. BULLARD. On the assessment of fiscal policy, what is the effect of the deficit program on longer-term Treasury rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question posed by Mr. Bullard.


Passage number 271.
 MR. STOCKTON. That is a hard question to answer with any precision, but here goes.  We have implicit in this forecast a rise in the ratio of federal debt to GDP of about 15 percentage points over the next two or three years.  You may recall that there was a whole cottage industry several years ago trying to estimate the effects on long-term interest rates of that.  One study done by Glenn Hubbard and Eric Engen, one done by Thomas Laubach, and I’m forgetting the third one now, but they all came up with effects.  Some were in the range of 2 to 3 basis points per percentage point. If you used those estimates to get a rough idea of how much you might be holding up Treasury yields from what they otherwise would be, you would get something between ¼ and ½ percentage point. I am not really sure in the current circumstances how  relevant some of that empirical evidence is, in that we don’t think we are going to be in a situation where there will, as Dan noted, be very much crowding-out because the output gap is so large over this period. It is not quite as though the federal government is going to be competing with the private sector for the resources.  There are going to be a lot of slack resources available, in our estimate of the output gap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting information and their own analysis without contradicting or challenging any previous statements or evidence.


Passage number 272.
 MR. BULLARD. Is that a global output gap or just the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a simple question asked by Mr. Bullard.


Passage number 273.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Just the United States.  I am not sure whether I would venture a guess as high as the upper end of that range, but clearly we are starting to hear some stories about Treasury yields being affected by anticipation of a very significant rise in debt here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 274.
 MR. BULLARD. Okay. I just have one more thing.  It is exhibit 9, which is “An Unconventional Policy.” We have two graphs at the top, on the unemployment rate and core PCE prices. I guess I would interpret these to say that, if you were serious about putting confidence bounds around these estimates, you probably could not tell these apart statistically.  Do you think that is a fair assessment, or are they more tightly estimated than that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 275.
 MR. SICHEL. If you look at the picture in Part 1 of the Greenbook, we have some confidence bands based on Greenbook errors. If you compare the large-scale asset purchases line in that picture with the baseline, the large-scale asset purchases line is near the edge of the 70 percent confidence interval. So they are different.  [Laughter]  It is important to acknowledge that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty, particularly in thinking about these types of programs and the effect of these types of programs.  If you think about all the steps as you go through the exercise of trying to gauge what the effect of these programs is and you go through all the steps of the purchase of securities—what is the effect on interest rates in the market where   the securities are purchased; what is the spillover to other markets; and then in this environment, what are the implications for economic outcomes.—there are many places to be very uncertain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions "a tremendous amount of uncertainty" and acknowledges that there are "many places to be very uncertain." This suggests that there is no consensus or agreement on the effects of the programs being discussed.


Passage number 276.
 MR. BULLARD. So there is a lot of additional uncertainty that may not be properly captured in those confidence bounds. Is that what you are saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is simply seeking clarification by restating the speaker's point.


Passage number 277.
 MR. SICHEL. Well, the confidence bounds are based on a draw of errors over the past 20-plus years. That may not correctly capture the environment that we are in now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sichel is simply stating a fact about the confidence bounds being based on past errors, and suggesting that the current environment might be different from those previous years.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 278.
 MR. STOCKTON. I think we can safely say that the confidence intervals are wide here, I think wider than we show in those estimates, probably wider than you can get on a legal size piece of paper.  [Laughter] We start out with our normal simulations that have all of the uncertainty about the shocks to the economy and even about the structure of the model of the economy.  These simulations have the tremendous added uncertainty of what these purchase programs will actually do to private interest rates, and as the note that was circulated to the Committee indicated, there is just a lot of uncertainty about how any particular program would affect mortgage rates, Treasury rates, the Baa rate.  We are doing our best here.  In some sense, this was a response to a question that you posed last time:  What would it take to fill the gap between the unconstrained and the baseline forecasts.  But I think it is extremely uncertain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is acknowledging that there is a lot of uncertainty and wide confidence intervals in their estimates. They also mention the added uncertainty of the effects of purchase programs on interest rates. This implies that there is disagreement or uncertainty about the impact of these programs.


Passage number 279.
 MR. BULLARD. We didn’t get lines that went like this or where it would have a huge effect but it would be very bad for other elements of the economy or something like that.  We did not really get that.  We got things that are close to baseline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. The speaker simply states the fact that they did not receive certain types of information.


Passage number 280.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We are doing Bayesian decision analysis and not classical hypothesis testing here. That is a very different proposition.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is stating a fact, that the approach being used is Bayesian decision analysis and not classical hypothesis testing. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 281.
 MR. LOCKHART. I decided to withdraw my question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, simply states his decision to withdraw a question without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 282.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot answer the question as the passage is incomplete and does not provide any information about President Stern or any statements made by him.


Passage number 283.
  MR. STERN. I want to get back to commercial real estate for a second.  As I recall, we had a very significant correction in commercial real estate in the late ’80s, early ’90s.  I wonder if you have looked at what you are anticipating for the next couple of years relative to that experience and whether it was similar, more severe, less severe, or whatever.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question about comparing the anticipated future of commercial real estate with a past experience.


Passage number 284.
 MS. DYNAN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 285.
 Actually, at this point, the rise in delinquency rates is— MR. STERN. You are going to get some help from Steve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing additional information and acknowledging that someone else will contribute to the discussion.


Passage number 286.
 MS. DYNAN. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 287.
 MR. OLINER. I am just going to add a few words.  I think we are expecting problems in that sector that will not be as severe as the downturn in the late ’80s and the early ’90s in large part because we did not have the massive amount of overbuilding in this cycle that we had then.  It is true that we have had a tremendous drop in demand for space, but we are coming into this cycle in a much better supply position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Oliner, is expressing his opinion that the problems in the sector will not be as severe as in the past because there has not been as much overbuilding in the current cycle. This is a statement of his perspective rather than a point of contention.


Passage number 288.
 MR. STERN. Okay. Thanks. The second question:  Did you calculate an implicit fiscal multiplier for the next couple of years.  If so, what is it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. It is a straightforward question asking for information.


Passage number 289.
 MR. SICHEL. We did.  Those numbers are hard to interpret, but we did a calculation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 290.
 MR. PLOSSER. I tried to get an answer on that, and they would not give it.  Maybe they will answer it for you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply stating his own experience of not being able to obtain an answer to his question and suggesting that the person he is speaking to might have better luck.


Passage number 291.
 MR. SICHEL. In the sorts of calculations we talked about of figuring out what the impulse is, we have a multiplier of about 1.3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact or calculation result.


Passage number 292.
 MR. STERN. One point three.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In the given passage, there is no indication of contention or disagreement between the speaker (Mr. Stern) and anyone else. The statement "One point three" seems to be an isolated response or statement without any context to determine any possible disagreement.


Passage number 293.
 MR. SICHEL. Yes. If you compare that with others, though, it is very important to be careful because those multiplier calculations include all sorts of different things.  What are you assuming is endogenous or exogenous.  What other things move, and when you do that  calculation, what of those things that move are you including or not including.  So we think that is very much in the range of the numbers that other analysts looking at this type of program are using. We do not think we are doing anything particularly different there.  You might see a number that looks different, but if you dig under the surface and you do an apples-to-apples comparison, I think we are very much in the range of what others are doing there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining the importance of being careful and considering different factors when comparing multiplier calculations with others. The speaker states that they believe their calculation is in line with what other analysts are doing.


Passage number 294.
 MR. STERN. Okay. Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any form of contention or disagreement. The speaker simply expresses gratitude by saying "Thanks."


Passage number 295.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It depends on the composition of the programs, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 296.
 MR. SICHEL. Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 297.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: N/A


Passage number 298.
 MR. FISHER. Real quick, a domestic question and an international question.  The domestic question, which is just a data question:  What do we expect the Treasury issuance to be in fiscal year 2009.  The numbers I have seen go up to $2½ trillion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a straightforward question without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 299.
 MR. SICHEL. We are projecting a deficit for fiscal 2009 of about $1.8 trillion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a projection or estimate, not an argument or a point of contention.


Passage number 300.
 MR. FISHER. But my question is new issuance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. The speaker is simply stating that their question is about new issuance.


Passage number 301.
 MR. SICHEL. I do not have those numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sichel simply states that he does not have the numbers that are being referred to.


Passage number 302.
 MR. STOCKTON. We have an answer to that question, but I do not have it right in front of me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they have an answer to a question but do not have it immediately available.


Passage number 303.
 MR. FISHER. Could you get it to me sometime.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for something to be done at some unspecified time.


Passage number 304.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or indications of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 305.
 MR. FISHER. On the international side—maybe this is a question for Nathan—I am curious. As I understand it, the Exchequer has given the Bank of England permission to purchase outright high-quality corporate bonds.  I presume that they have had the same kind of discussion that we have had about moral hazard, how far they want to go, which securities they   wish to purchase, and so on. I was thinking about that looking at this table in exhibit 11 and the United Kingdom’s predicament, but do you know who has some insight into that decision and how perverse or how wise it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is purely speculative and does not contain any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 306.
 MR. SHEETS. I think it is fair to say that, of the major central banks, the Bank of England has been particularly concerned about the moral hazard sorts of issues and has moved into these kinds of programs with great reluctance.  The major feature that I see of this announcement by the Bank of England is that now they can purchase outright stuff that they were taking only as collateral. My understanding is that this program is limited to AAA-rated assets, and I don’t see them taking on as a result of this a huge amount, or really any, credit risk under their balance sheet. So I interpreted this as a relative modest step down the road toward balance sheet expansion. That’s my reading of it.  We can look at it again more carefully and see if we have different views at that point. The U.K. program more generally had some really aggressive features that didn’t involve the Bank of England. For instance, the government is now going to be guaranteeing the asset side of the balance sheet as well as the liabilities side of the balance sheet for institutions and those sorts of things that were part of the announcement.  But I saw the Bank of England step as more incremental, rather than some sort of significant quantum shift in the orientation of their policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply provides their interpretation and understanding of the Bank of England's actions.


Passage number 307.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 308.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that there are other questions to be addressed after mentioning President Lacker.


Passage number 309.
 MR. LACKER. I’m looking at exhibit 9.  I note that the program involved half MBS, half Treasury and that mortgage rates fell 125 basis points and Baa rates fell 75.  What if it was  all Treasury.  What would the fall in mortgage rates be, and what would the fall in the Baa rates be.  Would the effect on growth be larger or smaller.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a hypothetical question about the potential impact of using only Treasury bonds instead of a combination of MBS and Treasury bonds.


Passage number 310.
 MR. SICHEL. I can tell you a little about that.  We did unpack the simulation and think about what if it was just $500 billion in MBS. What does that look like.  What if it was just $500 billion in Treasuries.  What does that look like.  It is very important to highlight the uncertainties that Dave Stockton just mentioned with these estimates being incredibly uncertain.  We are trying to do something consistent with what was in those zero lower bound notes, but boy, there is a lot of tough stuff going on. So when we do that and we think about a $500 billion Treasury package, we would see Treasuries coming down about 50 basis points and Baa yields and mortgage rates coming down about 30 basis points.  The assumption there is that you get a hit on Treasuries and then a somewhat smaller spillover into other markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing different scenarios and acknowledging the uncertainties involved in making estimates.


Passage number 311.
 MR. LACKER. Did you say 30 for both mortgage rates and Baa.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as there is no mention of any conflicting opinions or conflicting statements.


Passage number 312.
 MR. SICHEL. Yes, and there is no great science here.  It is looking at correlations of rates and how these rates have moved historically and so on.  If you look just at MBS, you find that you would get a bigger effect on mortgage rates, maybe something on the order of 90 basis points on mortgage rates, 50 on Baa, and maybe 30 on Treasuries.  Then when we take all of that and we run it through FRB/US and think about $500 billion of this and $500 billion of that, what are the output effects.  In FRB/US, the output effects are pretty similar for those two programs.  Now, there are many channels through which these programs would affect the economy that are not captured in FRB/US. One could make very plausible arguments for why, in fact, those two effects might not be the same, so let me just leave it there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting information and acknowledging that there are potential factors that may not be captured in the analysis.


Passage number 313.
 MR. LACKER. When you say “same,” you mean at the aggregate level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a clarification question seeking to clarify the meaning of the word "same."


Passage number 314.
 MR. SICHEL. At the aggregate level, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a statement made by Mr. Sichel without any opposing viewpoints or arguments presented.


Passage number 315.
   MR. LACKER. Presumably the fraction that is houses is different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about a hypothetical situation.


Passage number 316.
 MR. SICHEL. Oh, yes. But if you look at what the change is in the unemployment rate relative to the baseline, it is about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply acknowledges that there is a change in the unemployment rate but notes that it is similar to the baseline.


Passage number 317.
 MR. LACKER. The composition is different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only states a fact without providing any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 318.
 MR. SICHEL. Right, the composition is different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sichel simply agrees with the statement made by the other person.


Passage number 319.
 MR. LACKER. So this implies that, if you did $1 trillion in Treasuries, the Baa rate would be lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of fact that if $1 trillion in Treasuries were done, the Baa rate would be lower.


Passage number 320.
 MR. SICHEL. What is the comparison that you are doing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification about the comparison being made.


Passage number 321.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. He is multiplying by two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a mathematical operation being performed. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 322.
 MR. SICHEL. Yes, and then comparing it is lower than what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of any contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 323.
 MR. LACKER. I guess the 75. I guess I am confused.  I see—the Treasuries have a smaller overall multiplier.  It is like 30.  So it would be just 30.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing confusion and seeking clarification about a topic.


Passage number 324.
  So it would just be 60 on that and 60 on the— MR. SICHEL. These numbers are very rough. I feel like I am being tortured, giving these out here. [Laughter] They are very rough.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker's comment about feeling tortured and the laughter from others indicate a light-hearted tone, suggesting that there is no serious conflict or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 325.
 MR. LACKER. Two more questions. One for Brian.  In exhibit 6, the projections, bottom panel, longer-run inflation forecast, the dotted line is our October projections, and the solid lines are our January projections. If our intent was to find an inflation number that we all report that had some stability from forecast to forecast, we seem to have failed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that their intent was to find an inflation number that had stability from forecast to forecast, but they have failed to do so.


Passage number 326.
 MR. MADIGAN. Well, it could be that the Committee’s views have changed in the last several months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the Committee's views may have changed in the last several months.


Passage number 327.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. You mean, for example, where you want to anchor long­term inflation expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It is simply posing a question for clarification or elaboration.


Passage number 328.
   MR. MADIGAN. Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply presents a statement without any conflicting or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 329.
 MR. LACKER. So one interpretation is that the implicit longer-run inflation objective of the Committee has changed over this quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting an interpretation, rather than expressing disagreement with someone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 330.
 MR. MADIGAN. And one plausible reason for that is that the Committee is now experiencing the actuality of a very large negative demand shock and maybe it now believes that it needs a larger inflation buffer than it previously thought would be best.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply offers a possible reason for a belief held by the Committee.


Passage number 331.
 MR. LACKER. But this exact variability is what led us to be unhappy with the third year of the forecast mechanism for revealing an implicit inflation target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 332.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It could go the other way.  You could say that the trouble with the fixed target is that it doesn’t allow for knowledge to accumulate.  I mean, there really has been another deflation scare, and it may affect our views.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage presents a statement about a possible alternative perspective, but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply suggesting that having a fixed target may not allow for knowledge accumulation, and there has been a deflation scare that might influence their views.


Passage number 333.
 MR. LACKER. Okay. Well, we’ll discuss this more.  One final thing. I think I saw Governor Duke try to intervene during the conversation about the responses to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which was something I was discussing with Governor Kohn a minute ago. You know, when I think about what people say about credit constraints, the idea of a consumer with given characteristics—FICO score, income, and everything—with GDP growth of plus 3 versus GDP growth of minus 5, the identical consumer is going to be riskier in the second situation. If a bank is not willing to lend in the second situation and is willing to lend in the first situation, I assert that they would say they are tightening their standards.  I would also assert that it does not seem like a credit-channel, credit-constraint type of thing, as you might otherwise think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and making assertions about a certain topic.


Passage number 334.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It would be interesting to compare the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey over different cycles, for example.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 335.
 MR. LACKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: This question cannot be answered as the passage in question is not provided.


Passage number 336.
 Right, it would, but I was going to ask Governor Duke because she is probably actually— MS. DUKE. I will speak for myself.  When bankers talk about credit terms, that is typically going to be something like the credit score, the debt-to-income ratio, or some metric of underwriting with the most obvious example being GMAC’s announcement right after becoming a bank holding company that they were going to reduce their minimum credit score from somewhere in the low 700s to somewhere in the mid-600s, which would obviously mean that they would approve a larger number of applications.  Sometimes a change in terms is done to reduce the number of accounts or the volume; sometimes it’s done to increase the quality. A couple of things are going on. Right now you have the same consumers’ credit metrics deteriorating very rapidly. So even if you did not change the metrics you were using, you would still approve a much smaller proportion of the applications.  So that is going on.  The other thing I will be interested to see the next time we do this survey is that the banks are feeling a tremendous amount of political pressure on their lending.  I am not sure that they want to report that they have tightened their terms for consumer lending or even particularly that they are going to change those terms.  So I think we might see some pretty drastic reports of at least not tightening terms on consumer lending in the next survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and speculating on potential future survey results.


Passage number 337.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only provides one statement and does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 338.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Seeing no other questions, why don’t we adjourn for today, and we will begin tomorrow the first thing—9:00 a.m.—with the go-round.  There is a reception across the way and dinner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting the adjournment of the meeting, followed by a suggestion to commence the next day with a "go-round." The mention of the reception and dinner is unrelated to any conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 339.
 [Meeting recessed]  January 28, 2009—Morning Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good morning, everybody.  On the announcement of the extension of our various programs, we have had additional communication with the European Central Bank, and they are well disposed toward extending the swap arrangement.  But it turns out that they need a few more days to get formal approval from the Governing Council.  Their proposal is that we announce next Tuesday morning so that they can get the approval on Monday. We have had some discussions about communication strategy, and the view appears to be that putting all of our programs in one announcement is probably the best way to go because otherwise you create questions about why this and not that.  So although it puts some pressure on our confidentiality and all the other things, I think the plan—and I would be happy to take comments or advice—would be to hold off until next Tuesday morning to announce both the swap extensions and the credit programs that we voted on yesterday. President Plosser, we did inquire about the AMLF and had some discussions—talked with President Rosengren and his staff. The view is that there are some complications and difficulties with ending it in a peremptory way.  We will continue to discuss that, but we think for the moment we should not cancel it immediately.  President Rosengren, would you like to comment on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing updates and discussing potential plans.


Passage number 340.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Yes. As I said yesterday, I talked to the money market funds.  They do think that the backup facility, while they hope they don’t have to use it, has been serving a different purpose from some of the other facilities.  There is some concern that, if we were to announce the closure, we would get inundated with asset-backed commercial paper right before we closed down the facility. And the money market funds would have to do other things to try to  remain more liquid, so we might create issues that we are not trying to create at this time.  So I would be in favor of extending it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Rosengren expressing his support for extending a facility.


Passage number 341.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. With the understanding that we will continue to look at all these programs and review them and that we always have the option to restructure and rationalize what we do. Any thoughts or comments on the communication issue.  All right. If not, it is time for the economic go-round, and we will start with President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It discusses the willingness to review and potentially restructure programs and then transitions to the topic of the economic go-round. There is no conflicting viewpoint expressed.


Passage number 342.
  MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In Atlanta, we just completed a full cycle of our Branch board meetings and the Atlanta board discussions, as well as quite a number of pre-FOMC calls. No surprise, sentiment about the economy continues to worsen as more parties are feeling the effect of the downturn. Fallout from financial market stress and the contracting economy continues to spread and is affecting sectors previously thought to be insulated—for example, hospitals and universities.  Consumer retrenchment has significantly affected restaurants, the travel industry, and a wide variety of personal services.  The anecdotes I am hearing on consumer behavior are quite colorful.  Describing the popular culture, one director said, “It is cool not to spend.”  A director who is a chief financial officer of a large national home-improvement retailer described the recent shifts in consumer purchases within their stores in the direction of paint (if I am out of work, I might as well paint those walls), snow blowers (no longer willing to pay for service in the snow belt), and zero-radius lawnmowers (not to mow one’s lawn but to hire oneself out to mow others’ lawns).  Anecdotal feedback also supports the Greenbook view that house prices continue to feel downward pressure.  In some parts of the Sixth District—for example, South Florida and metro Atlanta—I am advised that prices may yet decline another 10 to 20 percent over the year.  There is widespread frustration over the inability to make longer-term plans in such a highly uncertain environment.  This seems the case across the spectrum of economic actors, including banks, large and smaller businesses, and households.  Investment decisions are being indefinitely postponed. We are hearing from business and consumer borrowers that they can’t get loans or that lending terms for new or existing loans have tightened to an extent that they perceive as unreasonable. Bankers are telling me that there is little loan demand from qualified borrowers. Our S&R examiners noted a migration to asset-collateralized secured loan structures for previously unsecured cash flow-based C&I loans. Prompted by the question that we sent out in advance, much of the discussion at our recent board meeting centered on Fed communication strategy and execution.  Atlanta directors were uniform in their call for intensified and simplified communication aimed at the general public to treat confusion, anxiety, and a deficit of confidence.  Saying much the same thing, financial market contacts emphasized the heightened importance at this time of a clear and credible framework and plan for improving financial conditions and the avoidance of the appearance of one-off emergency policies.  This theme reflects a context of deep concerns about the financial sector in general and some very large institutions in particular.   Turning to the national economy and my forecast, the broad strokes of my forecast haven’t changed materially since October.  Then I was, on balance, rather pessimistic, and I remain skeptical of a more V-shaped recovery developing in the second half of 2009 and 2010, as projected in the Greenbook. Now, I acknowledge that the Greenbook narrative used the words “gradually strengthening,” but it did depict 2 percent growth in the second half and 2½ percent next year. In contrast, I continue to anticipate a flatter, more protracted, L-shaped recovery moving through 2011.  It is my sense that the rebuilding—or “rearchitecting,” to use  Governor Warsh’s term—of the financial system and the rebuilding of business and household balance sheets will take a long time, restraining growth in the process. Similar to the “more financial stress” alternative scenario, I think the dysfunction in the ordinary channels of credit intermediation is likely to linger; and as in the “more cautious spending” alternative, I think rates of business and household saving could rise significantly and remain elevated after the recovery takes hold.  One Wall Street firm calls this their “frugal future hypothesis.” One of my financial contacts argued that the context of any recovery would be one of working through structural issues that are deep and wide.  The referenced structural issues include the balance of saving versus consumption, with the obvious implication for consumer demand. The potential for a longer period of more-intractable disinflation could obviously complicate progress toward recovery, and this possibility weighs heavily on my assessment of the risks we face. Also, I find it hard to think of an “appropriate” policy that anticipates core PCE inflation remaining under 1 percent through 2013, as in the Greenbook forecast.  Again, of course, the Greenbook forecast is not conditioned on appropriate policy.  I have, therefore, conditioned my assumption about the path of policy on adequately addressing the risk of further unwelcome disinflation that threatens deflation.  My longer-run outlook, assuming no further adverse shocks, has inflation returning to a 2 percent trend, and my growth projection converging to a 2½ percent potential. Let me add that I support the subcommittee’s proposal on the long­term forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a report from MR. LOCKHART discussing the current economic situation and his forecast for the future.


Passage number 343.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Hoenig.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 344.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, since the last FOMC meeting, our District’s economy has continued to weaken, and this weakness is widespread and is taking on more of the complexion   of the national economy.  Led by a sharp decline in manufacturing and slower export growth, year-over-year private employment growth slipped into negative territory in November for the first time in our region since ’04.  Consumer spending weakened in December despite heavy discounting, and residential real estate activity remains quite depressed.  Conditions in commercial real estate have deteriorated markedly, and financing in this sector has become extremely difficult.  I might add a footnote here:  In discussions of this with some of the folks involved in commercial real estate, they are concerned about a couple of years from now because in 2002, 2003, and 2004 there were a lot of commercial real estate projects put into play at very low cap rates and very good interest rates, with a 10-year balloon. So those are all turning now with obviously less value because they are assuming that the cap rates will be higher.  They are also assuming that the buildings will not be as new, and therefore the values will be under pressure. So they feel that the problems in commercial real estate are only beginning. Those parts of the District that depend on energy and agriculture continue to be somewhat better, but these areas are expected to show—and are, in fact, showing—declines, and we expect pretty sharp declines in ’09 due to the falloff in commodity prices.  District businesses are moving rapidly to address the sharp slowdown.  Many have instituted hiring and wage freezes, and layoffs have risen considerably.  Many businesses have significantly curtailed current production and future capital spending plans.  For example, our energy industry contacts expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction in drilling activity and a 35 to 60 percent reduction in capital expenditures in ’09. The fiscal situation for states and local governments has also deteriorated very rapidly.  Most District states are now looking at significant budget shortfalls over the next two years.  Most states plan to address these deficits through spending reductions rather than tax increases.  The situation for local governments is somewhat mixed, depending on whether they rely on property taxes or on sales taxes for the revenue base.  Many states and localities are looking for assistance from the federal stimulus package to avoid more draconian cutbacks in spending.  Banking conditions are deteriorating within the region.  Nonperforming loans are increasing, and losses are mounting as well. Turning to the national economy, recent economic data have been worse than expected, leading me, like others, to revise down the forecast for growth this year.  I now think we could see negative growth into the third quarter before the economy picks up as the fiscal stimulus begins to take hold later. In the near term, I see considerable downside risk to growth due to the pervasive weakness in the U.S. and foreign economies and the substantial financial headwinds that remain in place.  Indeed, I fully expect banking conditions to deteriorate further, even as financial markets begin to stabilize.  I am especially concerned that commercial real estate, as I mentioned earlier, could be the next shoe to drop, with broad implications for banks and insurance companies across the country.  Consequently, the strength and the timing of the recovery appear, obviously, very uncertain at this point. In terms of inflation, the significant decline in energy and commodity prices, along with a weaker economy, has obviously put considerable downward pressure on overall and core inflation, as a cyclical effect of this recession.  I think it would not necessarily be timely to start projecting deflationary pressures, and although I get more questions about that, at this point I don’t consider that the highest risk we have. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Hoenig, presents a negative outlook on the economy and expresses concern about the deteriorating conditions in various sectors, such as manufacturing, real estate, and banking. However, he also mentions that the fiscal stimulus could potentially improve the economy later on. This contradicts the negative tone and uncertainty he expresses earlier in the passage.


Passage number 345.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage contains a statement by President Plosser, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 346.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like everybody’s District, our District has slowed and continues to look very weak.  The business outlook survey actually rose a little lastmonth, but it is still measured deeply in recessionary territory.  Our banks continue to lend—to households, in particular. They have cut back on commercial lending, and credit quality continues to deteriorate across all loan categories in the District.  Housing sales are down, but prices have not fallen to the degree that they have in some parts of the country, probably on average—the declines have been more modest.  And the housing problems are not quite as bad as in some parts of the nation, but everything has deteriorated.  So, basically, in the Third District, the current economy and its outlook look largely like those of the nation as a whole, and all indications are that this recession will certainly be one of the worst in the postwar period. There are lots of reasons for doom and gloom.  As we have just heard, there are lots of reasons that we think that this recession and this weakness will continue, perhaps for some time to come.  But somebody has to take a somewhat more optimistic view—just to make the distribution complete, if for no other reason, right.  [Laughter] I think there are common elements to many business cycles.  I also find that one thing people have focused on a lot regarding the press and other things is that business sentiment, consumer confidence, and how people feel about the future appear to be very sensitive in this particular phase of the cycle.  Those things are pretty gloomy right now, but I would suggest that many economic cycles do have some commonalities, and one of those commonalities that often appear—not every time, but often—is that sentiment can turn around very quickly and it can change for reasons that sometimes we don’t understand or can’t easily predict. It is also true that financial markets can move very quickly in various directions.  We have seen them move very quickly to the bad.  Once markets begin to heal, they could move very quickly in the other direction. So for the sake of optimism, I think there is still a possibility that at some point—maybe not in the first half of this year and maybe not even in the second, but there is still the hope—things could turn fairly quickly.  I am not basing a lot on that, but I do feel somewhat more optimistic than a lot of people—including my staff, by the way.  They forced me to say that they take no responsibility for this, [laughter] and so I am letting them completely off the hook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging the overall weak state of the economy but also expressing a cautious optimism that sentiment and financial markets could turn around quickly.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 347.
 MR. HOENIG. They disowned you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

There is contention in the passage because Mr. Hoenig is asserting that the person he is speaking to has been disowned. This implies a disagreement or conflict between the speaker and the person being spoken to.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 348.
 MR. PLOSSER. They have disowned me.  They have had it.  I do anticipate the growth path to look somewhat like that in the Greenbook.  But I am basically a little more optimistic than they are—a very weak first half, maybe some positive growth in the second half, which may just balance each other out, but that may be an optimistic perspective.  I expect the economy to gain some steam in 2010, to about 3 percent, and settle into something closer to a steady state or at least to a long-run trend in 2011.  I have less overshooting in my forecast than some of the models do—and I think than the Greenbook—because, as I explained yesterday, I have less of an output gap than they do. I think some of the productivity shock on financial intermediation is showing up in less of a gap, and therefore there is less of a closure and pushback on the other side. Unemployment rates will clearly rise this year above 8 percent, but I hope that by the end of the year they will begin to stabilize or perhaps come down a bit. On fiscal policy, as I was asking the staff yesterday, I am not very optimistic that the fiscal package will do much for the economy.  A multiplier of 1.3 is probably pretty optimistic, from my perspective.  So I haven’t built in much effect from fiscal stimulus.  I hope the fiscal package is constructed to give its best shot at helping, but I am not entirely optimistic about what its shape will actually look like or whether it will actually be very much help. Obviously, because I am on the more optimistic side, the risks to my forecasts are clearly to the downside. My inflation forecast is less deflationary than the Greenbook’s baseline, and it is similar, as I said yesterday, to the alternative simulation labeled “anchored inflation expectations.” In that sense, I am relying more on forward-looking expectational models than on distributed lags of past inflation, which heavily affect both the output gap and the forecast of inflation going forward, given the wild swings in relative prices that we have seen.  I think more in terms of estimated new-Keynesian Phillips curves, in which the output gaps both are smaller and have less effect on inflation.  Again, those lead me to a little less dire scenario in terms of the deflationary pressure of output gaps going forward.  I put a lot more weight on our credibility for keeping inflation near 2 percent than on the past behavior of prices.  There is some risk to this inflation forecast, as I alluded to. Near term, we will not see much inflation.  I am not concerned about that. Nor do I think that deflation is going to be very persistent.  Some of it is already in train because of the way oil prices are behaving.  I do think that, in the longer term, there are inflation risks unless we manage our balance sheet appropriately.  I am encouraged by our discussion yesterday and some of the language that we talked about in terms of thinking about how we manage that in a careful way. Finally, I would just repeat my request—I think it was at our January meeting on inflation targeting—that it would be useful in our forecast summaries actually to forecast and report out, as we do with other measures, our assumed policy paths that each of us are using for our projections. In the internal summary, you give a verbal description of people saying what their assumed policy path is.  But I do think that it would be useful to summarize those in terms of both ranges and central tendencies because, as we move—assuming that we can and do—to a more explicit inflation-targeting regime, that range of central tendencies for the assumed policy paths should be added. I think it will both help for transparency reasons and help anchor expectations as to what we are doing, and that would be good.  So I would encourage us tocontinue to pursue that effort, and, of course, I am in favor of the longer-term projections.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser expresses his optimism about the economy and his skepticism about the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus. He also differs from the Greenbook's inflation forecast and suggests a different approach to policy paths and inflation-targeting.


Passage number 349.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude towards President Yellen.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 350.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are in the midst of a very deep and protracted downturn, and I have to squint really hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel.  It is a sad commentary that the one glimmer of light during this intermeeting period has been that economic developments have been roughly in line with our expectations.  In other words, we were braced for the bad news we received. For example, we had expected a dreadful holiday retail season, and that is precisely what we got.  One of my directors, the head of a national department store chain, reported that his company posted its worst season since it was founded in 1901. We had anticipated severe hemorrhaging in jobs and a sizable jump in the unemployment rate, and that, too, is what we got.  Many of my business contacts are reporting layoffs and wage freezes. One unpleasant surprise among the economic data was last week’s 15 percent drop in housing starts. The residential housing sector has now shrunk so much that the only real assurance that it will ever stabilize seems to be the fact that construction spending cannot go negative. This is just about the only zero lower bound that is working on our side.  [Laughter] Turning to financial markets, it is comforting that lending terms eased in a few markets, notably money and mortgage markets.  But equity markets continue to sink, and credit spreads remain breathtakingly large.  Another of my directors, the chairman of a large, well-known apparel company, reported that his company, which is rated BB, looked hard for additional financing and the best they could come up with was a loan rate of 18 percent.  We have also heard many reports concerning the tightening of trade credit.  Indeed, a particularly severe shortage of credit to finance international trade flows may conceivably help explain why both exports and imports are shrinking by abnormally large amounts relative to the decline in GDP. Looking ahead, I expect that, as in the Greenbook, high borrowing costs and the continuing credit crunch will help prolong the recession for at least a couple more quarters.  Accordingly, I project that real GDP will decline ½ percent this year, and the unemployment rate will rise to 8½ percent.  However, I am hopeful that a large and timely fiscal stimulus will help kick-start a recovery by the end of the year.  In particular, based partly on our situation in California, I think the Greenbook’s assessment of the impetus provided by the proposed federal fiscal stimulus directed toward state and local governments is on the pessimistic side.  The Greenbook assumes that such spending will roll out slowly over the next several years, providing little near-term stimulus.  However, my contacts told me that in California a lack of funds has already halted construction on a number of public infrastructure projects, and these projects could be quickly restarted if federal funds help the state close its huge budget gap.  Outside California, the data suggest that most of the country is facing near-term cuts in state spending in areas ranging from education to construction, and it appears that the fiscal stimulus will allocate money largely to those states that could most use it to avoid immediate spending cuts and finance shovel-ready infrastructure projects.  Still, even with a large fiscal stimulus, it will take many years before the economy returns to potential and economic slack is eliminated. Unfortunately, over the intermeeting period, I have become much more pessimistic about the downside risk to my modal growth forecast owing to the rapidly deteriorating condition of the banking system.  For much of the past year, it was the financial sector that was constricting the real economy, but now the slowing economy is returning the favor.  The sharp decline in equity prices and increases in CDS spreads for bank holding companies since our last meeting  presumably reflect the market’s concern about the likely magnitude of losses that will hit the banking sector. These losses now reflect a broad-based deterioration in performance across the whole spectrum of consumer and corporate lending.  As I mentioned yesterday, I share President Hoenig’s concern about commercial real estate over the next few years.  I fear a cycle in which rising vacancies and falling valuations make it impossible for owners to refinance loans that will be coming due, leading to forced selling and intensifying downward price pressures.  Such a development may undermine the soundness of many regional and community banks, whose exposures to this asset class are substantial. Let me conclude with some discussion of the outlook for inflation, for which there are also sizable risks. I expect core PCE price inflation to come in at about 1 percent this year and then edge down a bit more in 2010 and 2011.  Given the sizable downside risks to the forecast for economic growth, the risks to inflation also appear tilted to the downside.  As in several of the Greenbook alternative scenarios, it is not hard to imagine a situation with excessive declines in inflation and a long-lasting deflationary trap, much like Japan’s experience and perhaps even complete with zombie banks.  Of course, I am reminded that the last time we were concerned about the possibility of deflation in 2003 we were head-faked.  The deceleration in prices during that period was not sustained, and it was actually concentrated in a few categories of goods, particularly used cars with very flexible prices and owners’ equivalent rent. My staff has taken a first look at the current episode in order to see how widespread deflationary pressures are across various categories of goods and services.  Given the available data, they find in this preliminary look that the recent deflationary pressures are more prevalent now than during the 2003 deflationary scare.  Just as in 2003, some recent price declines are in categories of goods with highly flexible prices, like used cars and apparel, where price cuts could reflect a temporary response by retailers to sell off excess inventory.  However, disinflationary pressures are somewhat more prevalent now than in 2003 in categories of goods and services characterized by sticky prices.  We will be analyzing these data in greater depth going forward and monitoring them, but we think they raise the risk that we could see a prolonged period in which inflation falls well below the level consistent with our dual goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment.  That leads me, especially now, to favor going ahead with the publication of our longer-term projections, especially given that inflation over the next three years, our standard horizon, looks as though it is unlikely to converge to the levels that we think most desirable in the longer term.  I think it makes going ahead with the extended forecast particularly appropriate now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Yellen, expresses a pessimistic view of the current economic situation, stating that she is "in the midst of a very deep and protracted downturn" and that she has become "much more pessimistic about the downside risk to [her] modal growth forecast." This contrasts with the more optimistic view expressed in the Greenbook and the possibility of a recovery with the help of a large fiscal stimulus. Additionally, Ms. Yellen raises concerns about the deteriorating condition of the banking system and the risks of deflation, which further highlight the disagreement in the passage.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement simply expresses gratitude towards President Pianalto.


Passage number 355.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wish I could report some improvement in the outlook from my contacts, but sentiment in my District has not shifted.  Everyone is anticipating more bad news on the output front, and they are much less confident about when the turnaround is going to occur. Importantly, this is increasingly translating into reduced investment plans.  My business contacts who were previously uncertain about the outlook but had not yet reduced their planned investments now seem to be joining the tide of other businesses that are scaling back. Those who had already lowered their investment plans seem to be accelerating their reductions. I focused my conversations with my business contacts on investment decisions because it seems to be a critical factor separating the relatively optimistic private forecasters from the pessimists, and my contacts’ investment plans are keeping me very much in the pessimists’ camp.  I guess I am balancing out this end of the table.  In particular, I have revised down business fixed investment in my forecast.  I am now anticipating a steep decline of just over  20 percent in the second quarter, and this is the aspect of my forecast that changed the most during this intermeeting period.  I am now expecting to see a reduction in real GDP of  0.8 percent for 2009, the same as the Greenbook.  Potential growth in the medium term might be damped by some of these investment reductions, but I have not yet revised down my estimate for potential over the five-to-six-year period, which I put at 2.7 percent. I do see disinflation pressures continuing, and the gap remains elevated in my forecast.  But the pricing reports from my business contacts remain uncertain.  This uncertainty does not surprise me, given that the volatility we have seen in prices has been quite large.  But at this point, some people are just as worried about inflation as they are about deflation, despite the latest headline inflation data.  Obviously, they are looking at some of our longer-term policy decisions. Long-term inflation expectations in the Michigan surveys that we discussed yesterday, though, do not seem to be shifting either up or down yet.  Nevertheless, I do expect weak demand to gradually lower inflation rates to levels that are going to require further monetary policy actions. My projection reflects this.  But with inflation expectations in my projection unchanged, unlike the Greenbook, the decline in core inflation in my projection is less persistent than the Greenbook, and my outlook for core inflation in 2011 rises to 1.4 percent. In my view, our monetary policy needs to remain accommodative for a time to better insulate us from deflation and zero bound problems.  I am one of those participants who did change their perspective on the longer-term PCE inflation objective.  I had been in the¾ percent camp for some time, but because of my concern about deflation and zero bound problems, I have raised that longer-term projection to 2 percent for PCE inflation. It is difficult to feel very confident, as others have said today, about characterizing the balance of risks to the outlook in this extremely abnormal environment.  However, I cannot help but think that the risks to both economic growth and inflation are unbalanced to the downside.  Without data revealing some stability, it is hard to argue against more downside risks, as others have commented this morning.  Businesses are far more focused on survival than they are on new opportunities. On the inflation front, the stability of businesses’ and households’ inflation expectations, as we currently see them, may not remain, and so the downside risk to inflation remains. Regarding the longer-term projections, they were proposed by the subcommittee to help us with our communication with the public, and I have enthusiastically supported all of the recommendations and the steps in this direction.  I also support releasing our long-term projections from this meeting.  These projections should help the public solidify their expectations for economic performance, especially when our current troubles have abated.  I am also encouraged that there is strong agreement among the participants, as Brian reported yesterday, about our expectations for economic performance five to six years out.  So I think releasing them will be helpful.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply reporting on her contacts and providing her own forecast and perspective on the current economic situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 356.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Anticipating for a moment the statement in the policy round, there is a proposed sentence that says that the Committee anticipates a gradual recovery later this year with downside risks.  I am listening to the discussion about near-term pessimism and concern and uncertainty, but then you mentioned your forecast of minus 0.8 percent for 2009, which arithmetically suggests that you do think there will be positive  economic growth later in the year, and I think many of the projections that we got were in the same general ballpark.  I just want to flag that as an issue for the next round, which is whether we are comfortable talking about positive growth later in the year or whether we think we should just remain agnostic on that.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker raises a concern about the discrepancy between the pessimistic near-term outlook and the forecasted positive economic growth later in the year. They suggest discussing whether it is appropriate to anticipate positive growth or to remain uncertain.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 357.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed forecast has the unemployment rate well above the NAIRU and the inflation rate uncomfortably low throughout the forecast period.  Because our view is that inflation is more sensitive to significant excess capacity, our forecast implies an even greater risk of deflation than the Greenbook’s forecast. Even with the substantial fiscal stimulus and recent monetary policy actions done to date, our outlook implies that it will take more than five years to return to full employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent or more. Housing continues to be a key component of the problems.  Falling housing prices reduce the wealth of consumers, contribute to problems at financial institutions, and provide little incentive for residential investment to improve and so are a significant contributing factor to our dire outlook.  Until housing starts stabilize, I am skeptical that equity prices will show the improvement embedded in the Greenbook forecast.  The rising unemployment rate will be placing further pressure on housing but will also be a contributing factor in weakening commercial real estate, which a number of people around the table have highlighted.  Commercial real estate has held up better in some locations, such as Boston, but even those locations are beginning to soften. With little credit available and vacancy rates climbing, my contacts with real estate developers have become increasingly depressing.  In Boston, commercial real estate has also been buoyed by building by hospitals, colleges, and universities.   However, losses experienced in endowments have caused the construction to be halted unless it was fully funded and already started. Banking continues to be stressed. Large banks are experiencing large losses in their investment portfolios as highly-rated securities continue to sell at very steep discounts, if they sell at all. They are also likely to experience substantial increases in loan-loss reserves, which appear to be lagging the problems.  The economy and financial markets remain susceptible to further bad news emanating from the banks.  Despite monetary and fiscal actions taken or likely to be taken soon, our forecast indicates that, without more-significant actions, unemployment rates will remain too high and inflation will remain too low for an uncomfortably long period of time. Regarding the long-term projections, I do support publishing those.  I would note, as President Pianalto did, that there does seem to be an increase as to where people are targeting inflation. It might be good to update some of the staff work that was done on what the probability of hitting the zero lower bound is and what the probability of deflation is.  It does seem that our targets have been somewhat based on taste rather than focusing on the tails of the distribution. I think we have learned something about the tails of the distribution, and it might lead to a more informed discussion if we discussed in more depth what the probability is now that we have had some recent evidence of those two outcomes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, disagrees with the Greenbook's forecast and believes that there is an even greater risk of deflation. He also expresses skepticism about the improvement in equity prices and highlights the problems in commercial real estate and banking. He argues that without more significant actions, unemployment rates will remain high and inflation low for a long period of time. He also suggests updating the staff work on the probability of hitting the zero lower bound and deflation.


Passage number 358.
  Thank you CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Thank you" is repeated twice, and "President Stern" is mentioned separately, but there are no conflicting ideas or arguments presented.


Passage number 359.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I think there is little question that the immediate prospects for the economy are negative.  It is going to contract in this quarter; certainly my guess is the second quarter and possibly into the third.  But in response to your question, I do think there will be beginnings of the recovery in the second half of the year,precisely for the reasons spelled out in yesterday’s presentation:  the dynamics of the inventory-adjustment process, a gradual further improvement in financial conditions, the ebbing of weakness in housing activity, and the consequences of stimulative policies, both monetary and fiscal. So I do think that there is a reasonable probability—I guess this is going to make me the optimist at the table—that something like the Greenbook forecast is going to be realized over that time frame. I know there is a lot of negative sentiment around right now and a lot of negative rhetoric.  You know, that is part and parcel of a recession.  I am not suggesting that we take a lot of comfort from that, but I do think we should keep it in perspective that it goes with every recession that I have observed.  They can say, “Well, this time we really mean it,” [laughter] but somebody gave me an article from Time magazine back in 1991, and they were describing that recession just like this one.  So we should try to bear that in mind. That said, of the alternative simulations, the one that really caught my attention was the “more financial stress” scenario.  I do think some risks are there.  They are associated mostly with uncertainty about programs and prospects.  I do think that the establishment and operation of an aggregator bank, assuming it is done effectively, would be a good idea.  I think it might even be advisable to go further than that, using the Swedish example, and close down some large, insolvent institutions. I realize that is probably very, very difficult and possibly risky, but the benefits could be very high as well in reducing the uncertainty that seems to be plaguing the financial sector and a good number of its customers.  Finally, I do support the release of the longer-term forecasts.  I think that they provide additional information of value and that they will help to anchor expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their views and opinions on the current state of the economy and offering suggestions for potential solutions, but there is no indication of disagreement with others in the passage.


Passage number 360.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any substantive information or statements that could be subject to disagreement or contention. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Lacker.


Passage number 361.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be very brief.  Our indicators and the anecdotal reports from the Fifth District are quite consistent with the national picture and the picture that emerges from the reports that we have heard around the table from the Reserve Bank Presidents so far today.  There are only three nuances that I would take note of.  One is recent declines in the wage indexes in the manufacturing and services areas in our District—just a couple of months of decline but potentially meaningful.  Second, on the other side, expected prices received in manufacturing have swung decisively from negative territory in November, more than minus 1 percent, to positive territory, above 1½ percent.  Third, a fairly significant decline has occurred in the last two months in the index for expected capital spending in manufacturing. On the national level, our outlook is basically aligned with the Greenbook, with a couple of exceptions.  I am a bit more optimistic about the pace of growth when the recovery begins.  I expect inflation to return above 1 percent later this year and to get to about 1½ percent rather than sag in the out years. I do not think we are going to want to keep the nominal rate at the floor for nearly as long as the Greenbook expects.  I am thinking liftoff is likely sometime in 2010 rather than in 2012. I endorse the statements made by Presidents Evans and Stern and others about the depressing effect of the lack of clarity around government credit policy.  Capital injections that have occurred so far and prospects for future capital injections seem to have induced a tipping dynamic by which we are at a corner solution—there is no private equity coming in for fear of what future capital injections might do to them, and so we are left with the public sector being the only source of prospective capital. Looking ahead at the strategy, I think we want to get to a point where the banks are healthy, which means they can raise equity privately.  That transition  is the hard one to solve, and I endorse the ideas that President Stern just alluded to.  I would also say that I think public statements about our potential future credit programs and the expansion of our programs to asset classes could well be a drawback in that they add uncertainty about where we are going to come in next.  I will cede the rest of my time to my past self.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing additional information and sharing their own perspective, but they are not disagreeing with anything that has been previously stated.


Passage number 362.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions someone expressing gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 363.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As noted around the table, the economy continues to contract at a rapid rate, and there are few signs that the pace of decline has slowed. That said, clearly there are some positive elements in aspects of financial conditions, such as interbank funding rates. Corporate bond and mortgage rates have eased somewhat since our last meeting.  Oil prices have fallen a lot over the last few months, and that has bolstered household real income.  Moreover, the political uncertainty about what is next should lessen now that the Obama Administration has assumed power.  Over the next few weeks, the Administration is likely to pass its fiscal program and announce how it plans to utilize the second tranche of TARP monies. That should lessen some of the uncertainty in financial markets about the public policy response. But these developments should not comfort us much, if at all.  In my view, the risks to the New York Fed forecast and the Greenbook forecast, which don’t differ very much, remain very much to the downside, and we should emphasize that when we motivate our response to the crisis. In particular, in addition to the labor market woes already cited, the banking system is probably in worse shape today than it was last fall, despite the injection of hundreds of billions of dollars of government capital.  Moreover, the ability of the federal government to adequately recapitalize the banks as loan-loss provisions mount is in question, impaired by the question of whether the size of the second TARP tranche will be big enough to do the job.  A good portionof this is going to be used for other areas, such as mortgage foreclosure mitigation, and there are exceedingly poor politics associated with giving more resources to aid the banks, making it problematic whether a third TARP installment, which might be needed, can actually be secured politically. Inadequate bank capital is at the core of our problems, and I am not sure we are going to be able to solve this problem quickly or definitively.  It would be much better to do too much in terms of capital injection, taking back that excess later, than being a day late and many billions of dollars short as we have often seemed to be throughout this financial crisis.  Adequate capital in the form of tangible common equity is essential to restore confidence, improve credit availability, and restore good market function. The second issue I would like to talk about is household net worth.  It is contracting at a rate exceeded only in the Great Depression.  We should not understate the size of the blow to U.S. households, for households’ wealth has been evaporating at an alarming rate at a time when the personal saving rate has been unusually low and the safety net had been whittled back.  That is not a good combination.  This is the first big economic downturn in which defined-contribution plans, which are immediately affected by changes in financial asset value, are the dominant source of retirement income for many households beyond Social Security.  In the past, defined-benefit plans with a fixed monthly payment insulated retirees and their families from changes in financial asset values.  Moreover, the decline in wealth may not be over.  Although I will not predict the equity market, the Greenbook forecast of a 12 percent annualized return over the next two years could turn out to be optimistic.  After all, if bank balance sheet constraints are causing risk premiums to be unusually high, couldn’t this also translate into the risk premium for the U.S. equity market remaining high with lower equity prices at least over the near term.   Finally, even if equity prices do better, it certainly looks as though housing prices will continue to fall for another year or so, until housing inventories are brought down to more-normal levels. Third, the U.S. recession is occurring in the context of global weakness.  This means that the trade sector is not likely to provide any significant degree of support here or anywhere else.  I think this is very important, especially in the context of the staff’s analysis of the Reinhart– Rogoff consequences of past crises.  The staff forecast showed a lesser decline relative to past crises and what has happened historically. Yet in those past crises, individual countries had the out of depreciating their currencies and having trade improvement.  We do not have that out this time, and I think that just makes me a bit more nervous about whether our experience will be more in line with those historical experiences. I know the Greenbook and our own modal forecast assume that the recovery will begin in the second half of the year. I hope that is true.  But it strikes me that, until our banking system is repaired, the risks lie clearly to the downside of such a traditional-recovery, V-shaped forecast.  At a minimum, the degree of uncertainty about the outlook is unusually wide, as described in the Greenbook and illustrated by the width of our fan charts.  We are well outside the range of normal experience.  In such circumstances, model-based forecasts probably should be viewed with somewhat greater skepticism, and the Greenbook acknowledges that.  Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve needs to continue to be aggressive in providing liquidity and balance sheet capacity to the private sector.  The goal should be to ease financial conditions as much as possible in the current environment, subject to the constraints imposed by our legal authority, subject to protecting ourselves against credit risk and the issues posed by further rapid balance sheet expansion on our exit from our current suite of special liquidity facilities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the optimistic forecasts and emphasizes the risks and uncertainties in the economy. They argue that the banking system is in worse shape than before and doubts the effectiveness of government programs like TARP. They also highlight the negative impacts of declining household net worth and global trade weakness. The speaker calls for continued aggressive action from the Federal Reserve to address these issues.

Passage number 370.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Questions.  All right.  If there are no questions, why don’t we begin our policy and statement go-round.  Let’s start with President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward statement organizing the start of a meeting or discussion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 371.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I prefer alternative A. The current outlook envisions an inflation rate below 2 percent throughout the forecast period.  We have judgmentally adjusted our inflation forecast upward relative to the straight model outlook.  Thus, our forecast entails a significant risk of deflation occurring in 2010 unless additional actions are taken. I see little harm in expanding our program of purchases of mortgage-backed securities and GSE securities to lower mortgage rates further.  While this alone is unlikely to be sufficient, it will help stabilize housing and the financial sector.  I would prefer this policy to purchasing long-term Treasury securities.  Rates on long-term Treasury securities remain quite low as many investors prefer to hold government securities of all maturities.  Trying to reduce the spreads   relative to Treasuries is likely to be more effective as it more directly attacks the elevated borrowing costs. I would note that, in our own projections over the three-year period, not a single one of us had an unemployment rate back below 5½ percent, and I would note that only one of us thought that we would get to 2 percent if that was our inflation goal over the three-year period.  The difference between alternative A and alternative B is whether we say we might do something versus doing something.  It does seem that, if all of us think that we are not going to get to where we want to go within three years, this would be the time to actually do something.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker prefers alternative A and argues for expanding the program of purchases of mortgage-backed securities and GSE securities, while expressing a preference for this policy over purchasing long-term Treasury securities. This suggests a difference in opinion or preference within the group.


Passage number 372.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a brief expression of gratitude towards President Hoenig, and there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 373.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, obviously, as we have said, the downside risks to the economy are quite large, in part because we are involved in very serious banking conditions that probably also will worsen significantly over the next several months.  In particular, the exposures of the banking system and insurance industries to commercial real estate, as we have said, represent a significant risk both to financial stability and to economic activity.  There has been some improvement in financial market functioning in recent weeks, but most of the improvement is tied to the significant support from our programs and other government programs and not from the markets repairing themselves.  These repairs still lie ahead, I suspect, and this will absorb increasing amounts of our time as we try to deal with that. Second, over the next several months, fiscal policy will take center stage.  I think this is the first phase that we are hearing all the discussions about now, and this Committee will need to decide how it should position itself relative to a potentially large amount of new fiscal stimulus that has really not all been defined at this point.  I suggest it would be prudent then to wait to see  more about the form, timing, and likely effect of the fiscal stimulus before firmly committing to new expansionary policy programs that would be defined in alternative A.  In addition, fiscal steps to deal with toxic assets and thereby improve the functioning of the financial system may alter our approach to supporting the financial system and market stability.  I think there are some pretty significant issues around these institutions that will be discussed in the very near future.  Consequently, I favor alternative B rather than alternative A at this time. Also, as to additional nontraditional monetary policy measures that we might employ, I agree with the Board staff’s recommendation that we retain the option of purchasing long-term Treasury securities at a future date but not engage in these purchases now.  I do agree with what President Rosengren had to say about that. Treasury purchases would send a clear signal.  In addition to what President Rosengren said, they would clearly begin to acknowledge the monetizing of our deficit. At this juncture, I would prefer that we continue with our previously announced efforts to reduce the spreads of agency and private securities over Treasuries.  I would also like to recommend that we think ahead as to how we might provide support to institutions and markets that provide financing to commercial real estate, should conditions in that sector continue to deteriorate.  It would be helpful to try to outline a process that does not force us to again go around the intermediation process or find ourselves in a kind of very quick, over-the-weekend approach to things. I also favor the inflation risk discussion in alternative B. As I indicated earlier, the decline in overall and core inflation in the last couple of months and during the recession is to be expected and represents really no surprise, although it is significant.  Although I expect inflation to remain low for some time, I do not feel that deflationary risks have increased to the point that we need to reflect them in our communications.  In fact, I think that to do so could only lower   inflation expectations and put pressure on real interest rates.  I’ll stop at that point. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their views and preferences, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict with any other parties.


Passage number 374.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply expresses gratitude to President Yellen without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 375.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B.  I think it’s important to reiterate that we will likely maintain our target range of 0 to ¼ percent for some time.  I am certainly open to the idea of buying longer-term Treasuries, but I would not go forward with such a policy today, and I like the wording in B concerning our attitude toward that.  I am certainly also very open to the idea of expanding our purchases of mortgage-backed securities and supportive of President Rosengren’s views on this.  I think I would not go forward with it today, however, given that we have only just begun to buy these securities.  We have a long way to go before we ramp up to anything close to our commitment, and right now it makes sense to wait to see what the Administration puts forward in terms of their program to support the banking system, to see if they are willing to collaborate with us in expanding the TALF facility, and in what directions they plan to go and in what ways they may proceed to support the housing market.  So just in terms of the timing of a further commitment there, I think I would be tempted to wait. The one suggestion I would make concerning alternative B is that I would like to add to it the sentence from the end of paragraph 3 in alternative A that concerns the inflation risk assessment.  The additional sentence reads, “Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.”  I would add that to B because I think it is an accurate assessment of the situation, and commenting on the risk makes our discussion of inflation comparable to our discussion of growth, where we also comment on the risks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. YELLEN is expressing her preferences and opinions on different policy options, but she does not express disagreement with any other individual or their views.


Passage number 376.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone called President Pianalto.


Passage number 377.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As you noted, we all agree that the outlook for economic growth is bleak.  To be sure, our policy actions so far have been aggressive; but even so, I have a predisposition to provide further monetary stimulus.  From a risk-management perspective, there are very few scenarios I can think of that would suggest that further monetary stimulus would be a mistake.  But despite my bias for action, I am hesitant about how to proceed. As I was putting my thoughts together for this portion of the meeting, I recalled the many conversations that we have had around this table about our communication policy.  Even when we were operating in a well-defined policy regime, we often experienced great difficulty in determining how best to express our decision and our intentions publicly.  Now we are operating in a new policy regime—credit easing—that we understand conceptually but for which no operational handbook yet exists. We don’t know how to write down the policy rule for this environment, and we surely don’t have any empirical estimates to guide our decisions.  Our discussion yesterday about what the effect is of a $250 billion purchase of MBS or a $250 billion purchase of longer-term Treasury securities demonstrates that we just do not have certainty around the effects of those actions.  Before this crisis began, the public had a fairly good grasp of our policy rule. Now they are trying to find the new rule, and I hope they do not find one before we figure out exactly what it is. [Laughter] I certainly hope that we find it before John Taylor does. The serious issue is how we can best manage expectations in this policy regime when we are so uncertain about so many things.  Alternative A, in my view, conveys a stronger degree of certainty to the public than I have at the moment about our policy rule.  I don’t know the basis  for selecting $250 billion more of mortgage-backed securities or $250 billion additional in the longer-term Treasuries.  I do not want to convey or set up the expectations that, by wanting to ease more, we are now going to use the $250 billion increase in our announcement of purchases, whether they are mortgage-backed securities or longer-term Treasuries, just as the ¼ percentage point change in the fed funds rate had been viewed in our prior policy regime.  Alternative B doesn’t cite specific quantities, but it does communicate a willingness to step up the pace and to extend the duration of our credit programs, and I think that is the appropriate action for today.  The alternative also reminds the public that additional credit easing in the form of the TALF and mortgage-backed security purchases is on the horizon, and I think we will be well served to tell the public as much as we can and then update them frequently as our own views evolve.  I think alternative B does that without overstating what we know. In favoring alternative B—and I am now the fourth person in this go-round—I am going to offer a fourth alternative in terms of the language.  I, like President Yellen, would add paragraph 3 from alternative A regarding our inflation outlook.  Then given our go-round today and your comments about how you heard the go-round, Mr. Chairman, I think paragraph 2 in alternative A more accurately describes the view that we have had more weakening than we thought. So those changes—paragraphs 2 and 3 out of alternative A but paragraph 4 out of alternative B—are what I would recommend for today.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Ms. Pianalto is expressing her thoughts and considerations about the current policy regime and the uncertainties surrounding it. She discusses different alternatives and offers her own recommendations, but there is no disagreement or conflict with other individuals mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 378.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Just to clarify, I think what Brian says is right.  The only difference between alternative A, paragraph 2, and alternative B, paragraph 2 is that in A(2) it says “weakened somewhat more than anticipated” whereas in B(2) it says just “remains weak.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is indicating that the speaker agrees with Brian's perspective without introducing any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 379.
” MR. MADIGAN. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of only one statement, without any conflicting or contradictory elements.


Passage number 380.
MS. PIANALTO. Right, and we were commenting that many of us said that things had gotten weaker.  That is the only observation I would make.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Pianalto is simply stating her own observation without contradicting or arguing with anyone else's comments.


Passage number 381.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you. President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It consists of a simple expression of gratitude followed by the mention of President Bullard.


Passage number 382.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement made is a polite expression of gratitude towards Governor Kohn.


Passage number 383.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly think the economic outlook is unsatisfactory, and it sure has not gotten any better over the intermeeting period.  I am not sure it has gotten materially worse. If I look at the Greenbook forecast, the revisions to Q4 and Q1 are to the right of the decimal point, and we have a lot more fiscal stimulus coming.  I am not totally comfortable with President Pianalto’s suggestion to emphasize that it has gotten worse, but certainly the outlook remains quite weak.  I think we are in a situation where we need to be   looking for everything we can do to ease financial conditions.  I would encourage you, Mr. Chairman, to pursue an understanding with the Treasury, which you talked about yesterday, about the division of responsibilities on risk-taking and also about reserve sterilization over time.  In particular, if we can get legislation and understanding on the latter that enables the Treasury or, even better, the Federal Reserve to issue bills without debt limits and congressional controls, what you called yesterday the shadow price of our balance sheet space would diminish very, very considerably, and we could play the more aggressive role that President Bullard was talking about. We wouldn’t have to worry about how we are going to take it back.  If we have another tool to take it back, we would be much more aggressive on our activities. I think right now the constraints on the financial system are more about capital and worries about future capital, downside risk, than they are about liquidity.  I do like the division of labor in the TALF—that the Treasury takes the risk and we supply the liquidity.  I think I am uncertain now whether it will be effective.  I think there is a good chance, but as we get experience with that, we should be looking very hard at other markets like CMBS that might also be helpful. Also, we should be looking at how we could be useful in other aspects of TARP 2, subject to the constraints about risk-taking and balance sheet space that you had noted yesterday, Mr. Chairman.  I think lifting and ring-fencing assets may be very, very valuable to reducing risk and stabilizing the system. On the Treasury security purchases, I think it is correct not to do that now.  I guess I would keep it a little more on the front burner than what I am hearing from some other people.  Rates are pretty low now. I would keep my eye on those forward rates.  If they look as though they are coming up, I would give it some serious consideration if we thought that the market was  building expectations about future rates that were inconsistent with returning the economy to high levels of employment over time. I would be more in favor of it. So I think we have a number of things in train right now.  We need to see how the Administration is working out.  I agree with the others who have said that we are temporarily in wait-and-see mode.  I am comfortable with not doing anything now, as we have under alternative B, but working very, very hard on new initiatives as we see where we can be useful. With regard to other wording issues on alternative B, I agree with President Yellen and President Pianalto that taking that sentence from A about inflation being too low and putting it in paragraph 3 here would be good, especially in conjunction with that “help to preserve price stability” that President Fisher suggested we put in the last paragraph because now we are helping to preserve it from below.  I think those two things would work together, and I hope we have the long-term projections coming out, which will reinforce that message.  So I agree with that. President Bullard yesterday and again today emphasized whether the monetary aggregates or reserve aggregates can be useful to us.  I guess I start somewhat skeptical about that, but I think we should be doing very hard research about whether broad measures of money or narrow measures of reserves have some relationship to spending even at the zero bound.  President Bullard, you said that M2 growth looks a little low to you this year.  Under these circumstances, how are we going to raise that.  Will putting in more reserves do anything.  I am not sure, but I would encourage you and your staff and others around the System to work hard on whether these quantitative measures are more useful to us right now.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinions and perspectives on various issues, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict with others.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 384.
 MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The use of the phrase "Mr. Chairman" indicates that there is a potential disagreement or opposing views being presented.


Passage number 385.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage provided. The passage only mentions President Hoenig without indicating any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 386.
   MR. HOENIG. Two or three people have mentioned the last sentence in paragraph 3.  I would just like to get a bit of reaction from Governor Kohn or President Yellen.  My concern with putting that sentence in is that you change expectations toward the thing you are trying to avoid. If we suddenly start saying that we are thinking inflation is getting too low and it is not consistent, people then are going to be convinced that it is getting too low and we are going to put more pressure on it.  We ought at least to think about that before we get on a bandwagon here. That is my caution.  I do not know if anyone wants to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Mr. Hoenig expresses concern about the last sentence in paragraph 3 and suggests that it may change expectations in a way that could be counterproductive. He cautions against getting on a bandwagon without thinking about the potential consequences. This indicates disagreement or differing viewpoints among the individuals involved.


Passage number 387.
 MR. PLOSSER. I would just reiterate that. I worry about that phrase for exactly that reason. We potentially shape the expectations in a way that we do not want to have them shaped by going too far in that direction.  So I share your view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 388.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It is a very difficult question.  On the other hand, it also suggests that our policy will be more aggressive.  So it is a bit hard. I honestly do not know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements that suggest contention or disagreement. The author is simply expressing uncertainty and admitting that they do not have a clear answer to the question.


Passage number 389.
 MR. PLOSSER. Or, in fact, it may suggest that, if we believe it, our policies aren’t going to be enough to prevent it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting a possibility or alternative perspective that the mentioned belief may imply that current policies are insufficient. However, this does not create any conflict or disagreement within the passage itself.


Passage number 390.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I see. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement "I see. President Lacker" implies that the speaker acknowledges or understands something that President Lacker has just said.


Passage number 391.
 MS. YELLEN. It is in our longer-term forecasts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a statement without any contention or disagreement. It simply states that something is in their longer-term forecasts.


Passage number 392.
 MR. KOHN. Yes. Well, we will be publishing forecasts that have those inflation numbers in them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about publishing forecasts with certain inflation numbers.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 393.
 MR. LACKER. The spread of views on this is likely to be related to the extent to which we believe our credibility is complete—in other words, if we think that expectations about inflation are so fragile and so changeable that our statement highlighting the possibility of deflation could move them around.  On the other hand, you could take the point of view that they are so well anchored that it will not move them around.  I find myself in the Hoenig and Plosser  camp on this—not viewing them as as well established as we want.  Well, that is consistent with my statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses a difference in views on the extent to which expectations about inflation are well anchored. He aligns himself with the "Hoenig and Plosser camp" who believe that inflation expectations are not as well established as desired.


Passage number 394.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The term "Vice Chairman" does not indicate any specific contention or disagreement. It is a neutral title that signifies a position within an organization.


Passage number 395.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. The tension here is that this is probably factually correct, and so the question is whether or not you want to say what is factually correct because you are afraid that it will influence expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing a potential dilemma or concern but does not indicate any disagreement or contention between individuals or groups.


Passage number 396.
 MR. PLOSSER. Well, there are a lot of things that are factually correct that we don’t say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact and there is no contradictory statement or argument present.


Passage number 397.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That is also factually correct.  [Laughter] Others can comment on this. I must admit to not having a strong view myself.  I think the coward’s way out is to say that we do not know yet. That would be one reason, President Yellen, to delay a meeting or two before putting that in.  But, of course, I understand exactly what you are saying, and it may well be the case that this is yet another way of signaling a long-term, aggressive policy. But, President Evans, you are next, so why don’t we just go straight to you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is acknowledging different viewpoints and expressing their own uncertainty without taking a strong stance on the topic.


Passage number 398.
 MR. EVANS. Let me ask a question.  Has anybody conveyed that thought in speeches or testimony either from you or Governor Kohn, in which case it would be less newsworthy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking if anyone has expressed or conveyed a certain thought in speeches or testimony, suggesting that if they have, it would be less newsworthy.


Passage number 399.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I do not think so, and that is why I am a little leery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage indicates a personal belief or opinion, but does not express any disagreement or contention. The statement "I do not think so" expresses doubt or caution, but without any opposing views being presented, there is no contention or disagreement. The phrase "and that is why I am a little leery" further reinforces the personal hesitation instead of contention.


Passage number 400.
 MR. EVANS. All right. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Evans is expressing gratitude for something, indicating agreement rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 401.
 MR. YELLEN. I have certainly said it in speeches.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "I have certainly said it in speeches" is a response to a statement made by someone else and does not express disagreement or contention.


Passage number 402.
 MR. EVANS. Right. I may have said something like that, too; I’m not quite sure.  Okay. Thank you. I do find myself largely in agreement with the emerging consensus here.  In fact, as I was listening to President Yellen’s comments, I found them to be wholly satisfactory from my viewpoint. I do have a preference for alternative A today.  I think obviously what we would like to do is to lower the funds rate, but we cannot do that.  So we are struggling for the best way to do that, and we do not have a great way to understand exactly the influence of our credit programs on that. I ask myself what the value of waiting and seeing is right now.  On the one hand, we have not implemented the TALF, although we have been talking about it for quite some time, and so it will be useful to have some experience with that and see what the signals are coming from that.  I find myself in agreement with Governor Kohn on this, but I am unsure how it is going to work out, and so there will probably be some adjustments.  Then I ask myself whether we can afford to wait, given what we are looking at.  It does seem as if there is a lot of uncertainty as to fiscal policy—exactly what the size of it will be and how it will play out.  In our own forecast we have a stronger role than some others, but uncertainty is there.  As I looked at alternative A with the MBS, it mentions that we are not going to complete this until the end of the third quarter, and that by itself has a great amount of delay.  I think that is very pragmatic, and that is the way it would actually occur. I am not quite sure whether the cost of putting that off and announcing it at our next meeting, if that is the right way to do it, would be that high.  There is also the uncertainty of what the Administration will pursue.  As President Bullard and others mentioned, if there is a proposal for a large aggregator bank coming forward from the Administration, what will be the size of that.  What are the dimensions of that, and would we need a big action now or how would that play into it.  There are a lot of uncertainties, and so I just cannot say I know for sure on that. In terms of the specifics, I did find myself okay with the language on inflation perhaps as “below rates that best foster economic growth.”  But I agree—there is a lot of uncertainty as to how that will be perceived, but it does seem factually correct that there is some risk.  So I would   be okay with that. I suppose we have not really discussed—or have we.—your question, Mr. Chairman, about the sentence whether we anticipate a gradual recovery later this year.  It does seem to me as though in almost every forecast we see economic growth certainly being positive by the fourth quarter and we hope by the third quarter.  I worry a bit that, if we are more pessimistic in our statement about that, it would seem to be some type of vote of no confidence in fiscal actions that are forthcoming.  It doesn’t seem to be factually incorrect that we are expecting this, and so I would favor leaving that.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the emerging consensus and shares their own views and preferences without conflicting with anyone else's statements.


Passage number 403.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The speaker, President Lacker, is expressing gratitude, which indicates a positive tone and absence of disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 404.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I fully support the expansion that we have engineered in our monetary liabilities.  I view our strategy as having expanded them fairly dramatically to provide stimulus now that we are at the zero bound.  I think our strategy going forward is going to be focused on maintaining them at a high level and, while the economy is in distress, perhaps varying the quantity and perhaps increasing it should distress increase, and that seems productive.  When the economy recovers, begin withdrawing that stimulus; then at some time in the future, lift the funds rate off the floor.  I am cognizant that assessing the appropriate magnitude of that expansion is terribly difficult, for reasons that President Bullard and Governor Kohn discussed. We are, in fact, at the limit of our professional understanding of the transmission mechanism, although I think there is a lot that is known that we could fruitfully review and discuss in the Committee on this issue.  I am less supportive of the way in which we brought about this expansion in our monetary liabilities, as you all know.  As I said yesterday and on many other occasions, I think the case for targeted credit programs is weak, briefly put.  They do not address any demonstrable market failure.  They channel credit away from other worthy borrowers, exacerbate moral hazard, and set bad fiscal precedents.   Regarding the exit strategy, I do not see anything inherent in the economics that has motivated our intervention into these programs or that links that to the state of the business cycle and where the funds rate needs to be. So I do not see why it would necessarily be the case that, when we want to lift the funds rate, the perceived needs in any of these dysfunctional credit markets will have necessarily gone away.  I think that is clear just from the way the case has been made and the fact that credit markets can dysfunction in the way they have been claimed to dysfunction in peacetime, in any part of the business cycle. The TALF is our next new targeted credit program to be introduced.  It is on deck to be implemented in February.  I believe that it would be better policy for us not to implement the TALF but instead to expand our balance sheet by buying U.S. Treasury securities.  The effect on credit markets will be more neutral.  It will avoid distorting credit flows across private borrowing segments.  Adverse incentive effects would be minimized, and I think it would maintain more distance between us and redistributional fiscal policies.  Concerning buying Treasuries, I think that monetization is something that I am less concerned with because the way I view it is that the choice should be what we buy, in which case we are monetizing the same amount of stuff. I can appreciate the concern that, coming at a juncture in time in which a large fiscal stimulus is being enacted, there would be a natural risk—and I think it is a risk—that the public would make the inference that our increase in the balance sheet was at the behest of the Administration.  I think we should strive to avoid that.  If we maintain our monetary liabilities flat across this episode for the next quarter or so, we would be able to do that, but I will admit that is a risk. You have had conversations and will have conversations with the Administration about the idea of a new accord.  As I said yesterday, I applaud those.  I think that is another reason to hold off introducing any new program that we might ultimately be considering—and Ithink we ought to consider—transferring wholesale to the Treasury.  For all of these reasons, Mr. Chairman, unless we decide at this meeting to defer the TALF, I would respectfully dissent because I would prefer to expand the monetary base by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker disagrees with the way in which the expansion in monetary liabilities has been brought about and expresses dissent regarding the implementation of the TALF program. They propose an alternative strategy of expanding the balance sheet by buying U.S. Treasury securities.


Passage number 405.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Just a small point.  I would view it as unlikely that conditions would be unusual and exigent across a wide span of credit markets simultaneously when we were having a significant recovery in the economy.  But of course, that is an empirical issue. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The writer is expressing their opinion and stating that it is an empirical issue that needs to be verified.


Passage number 406.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 407.
 MR. LACKER. Excuse me, if I could just reply—in the TALF as it is envisioned, we are to declare that for three years it is going to be unusual and exigent, as I understand it.  Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply seeking clarification or confirmation regarding the TALF (Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility) and its duration.


Passage number 408.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. No, not really.  The term funding lasts for three years, but the actual program ends at the end of this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that the funding for the program lasts for three years, but the program itself will end at the end of the current year. There is no conflicting information or conflicting opinions expressed.


Passage number 409.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Right, which is similar, for example, to what the FDIC is doing with the systemic risk exception with the 10-year bond issuance.  Also, from a monetary policy point of view, our plan for these programs is to create terms that will automatically extinguish interest at some point as conditions normalize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply explains similarities between two actions (FDIC's systemic risk exception and the speaker's plan for programs) and discusses the intention to automatically extinguish interest in the future.


Passage number 410.
 MR. LACKER. So the interpretation is that circumstances have to be unusual and exigent at the time it is entered into.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward statement presenting an interpretation.


Passage number 411.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, there are some legal niceties here that we can get to another time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The phrase "Well, there are some legal niceties here that we can get to another time" suggests that there might be some points of legal intricacies or specific details to discuss later, but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 412.
 MR. LACKER. No doubt. Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply thanking someone for a statement.


Passage number 413.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 414.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a polite expression of gratitude towards President Lockhart.


Passage number 415.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my view, the worrisome recent developments in the financial markets, combined with the current self-reinforcing interplay of bank news, economic data, and deteriorating public confidence, call for another increment of action in advance of the Administration’s proposals with their inherent unpredictability—that is, the unpredictability of the political process.  I could or I will accept alternative B, but I support alternative A, which I would characterize as signaling that things are a bit worse, take out some insurance, and do a little more.  I think the characterizations of the state of the economy in sections 2 and 3 are appropriate. I actually, to some extent, supported the use of the word “sizable,” but I am certainly okay with the change back to “significant” as a safer term.  I also interpret section 3 as saying that at least continued disinflation is a real risk, and I think that is a realistic statement at this time.   I support alternative 1 in section 4 with its action of adding $250 billion to the MBS program.  I am persuaded by the staff argument, which is supported by my own staff, to defer but keep on the table the introduction of a longer-term Treasury securities purchase program.  However, I would tinker a little with the words “prepared to” for reasons somewhat similar to President Plosser’s. I think “prepared to” may convey too much intentionality. It could be interpreted as “absolutely ready but holding off,” or conceivably someone else might interpret it as “inclined to but with some hesitancy at this stage.”  I think it is, therefore, too ambiguous.  I would prefer signaling that the Committee “holds open the option” of such a program, and I would prefer those words over something like “still evaluating.”  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their support for various proposals and offers their own interpretations and suggestions, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 416.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply expresses gratitude to someone named President Stern.


Passage number 417.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B, as written.  I think it does accurately capture the sense of the discussion here.  There are probably other ways of capturing that sense, but for me that does the trick reasonably well.  I do think it provides us with ample flexibility—ample leeway in the short run—to pursue our objectives.  I don’t worry much that it is going to unnecessarily constrain us in the next few months to do what we think we need to do.  So I find that all positive. Finally, I would avoid associating quantities with purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other things.  They seem arbitrary at this point, and I think paragraph 4, as written, conveys the message without putting in the numbers.  So I am pretty happy with it as it stands.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Stern, expresses his approval and support for alternative B, stating that it accurately captures the discussion and provides flexibility. He also suggests avoiding associating quantities with purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other things. Overall, there is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 418.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Thank you. President Fisher" does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude towards President Fisher.


Passage number 419.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I submitted my recommendations in writing.  I am pleased with the way they were included. Basically, what I am hearing is that we should take alternative A and append paragraph 4 of alternative B and most parties would seem to be satisfied, at least those that are most worried and expressed themselves.  I will use President Yellen as an example, but as others did as well. With regard to that one sentence that is at the end of paragraph 3—“Moreover, the Committee sees some of risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth,” et cetera—I think we offset that by the reference to “help to preserve price stability” at the very end. The reason I wanted that included—and I thank you for its being   included—is that it speaks from both sides of this.  We are not going to tolerate deflation, and we are aware of the fact that there are concerns that we are setting the stage for an inflationary backlash. So my recommendation is to use those first three paragraphs in alternative A and the last paragraph in alternative B.  I agree with the majority of the sentiment at this table.  I would not have specific numbers.  My colleague to my left refers to that as crude.  I would say that it just puts a target on our chest, meaning that it gives the markets something to shoot at.  But if we don’t deliver or somehow we are not interested in finally getting those numbers, we have basically set ourselves up for disappointing the marketplace. I would also, in the interest of being provocative but at the same time sensible, take President Bullard’s suggestion with a full heart.  I would take that first sentence and change it:  “The Federal Open Market Committee will keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent,” and I would put it as the second sentence in paragraph 4.  The fact is that we are focused on all of the rest. So it would read, “The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  The FOMC will keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The focus”—and the operative word is “focus”—“of the Committee’s policies,” et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So those are my recommendations there.  I would like to add one other point, Mr. Chairman, and that is when we talk about waiting to see what happens.  I think that is a very good point. We don’t know what is going to come out from the fiscal side.  We don’t know what is going to be proposed in terms of the Treasury.  President Stern made what I thought a sensible reference today not only to the aggregator bank but also perhaps to the need to close down some operations. I hope that we will bear that in mind. I would like to leave you with just a simple analogy.  In the medical field, the greatest costs are at the very end of life, the last year of life.  That is, certain that the sting of death will strike, we spend most of our medical expenses keeping someone alive, knowing that they are going to die. It seems to me that we are doing that with too many institutions.  You made a comment in our last conference call that you drew the line at the failure of Bank of America.  I think I understand you. But I would not draw the line at letting somebody fail, and I think we need to begin to work our way toward that in order to clear the air and deal with the issues in a forthright manner. That is a separate subject.  I have strayed too far. In summary, alternative A, the first three paragraphs, with paragraph 4 from B, and consider President Bullard’s grammatical change as sensible English.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their satisfaction with the recommendations and blending different elements from different alternatives. They also mention agreeing with the majority sentiment and supporting a grammatical change suggested by another person.


Passage number 420.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. My remark about Bank of America referred to a disorderly or uncontrolled failure.  Obviously an orderly wind-down that preserves stability is a different matter.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker first clarifies their remark about Bank of America, stating that it referred to a disorderly or uncontrolled failure. They then go on to state that an orderly wind-down, which preserves stability, is a different matter. Governor Warsh's viewpoint or response is not mentioned in this passage.


Passage number 421.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Maybe I will start with a note on the political economy before turning to the statement.  I had thought that we would know the situation was improved when the Fed was off the front pages.  I think we have been off the front pages not because the situation has improved but because the Treasury is taking over the front pages, and that is a good thing. So I feel pretty comfortable that we are finding ourselves slowly but surely into this week’s headlines that we are murky and they don’t know.  I am not that encouraged, as I think about this statement for us, to try to make news if we don’t have it.  The baton has been passed to a new Administration, and we should be cautious about stepping up before we know exactly where they are and before we know where we are.  That is just an instinct, which maybe pervades and suggests a preference for alternative B.   With respect to a couple of the items that have been debated on alternative B, Mr. Chairman, I would resist the suggestion that we import the sentence in section 3 of alternative A.  I prefer to keep it as is.  I would rather not, to the point made at the other end of the table, add on additional risk at this point in the public square.  My own sense is that the risks haven’t changed materially since we last met.  But adding that sentence suggests that somehow we are now acknowledging that they have, and at least to my mind it is not quite there.  Even though sometimes I also have an instinct to make the statement a confessional of sorts, I think it is dangerous for us to do that until the lust is outside our hearts, so to speak.  [Laughter] I had always been accused by someone who very recently sat at this table of temporizing.  But with his recent absence, I suggest that we temporize here on paragraph 3.  [Laughter] Though I think it is quite possible that we will include a sentence along the lines that President Yellen suggested, put me in the temporizing camp, but please don’t tell him. So what does that mean.  I like alternative B as written. Not to add to your burdens, but I am also uncomfortable with the way the sentence reads on the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities.  I read it and I think the markets would read it as that we have reached a decision.  The way it is written now is that we have reached the decision that we are likely to do it later.  I think that is not quite where we are. So given the position we are in, I would make the following minor edits, which I think change it a little. I would say, “The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities”—now I change a few words here—“if circumstances were to evolve in a way that such transactions would be particularly effective,” because, again, I think as written it says “if evolving circumstances indicate.”  I think they read that to say, “We presume circumstances will be evolving, and we will take these actions.”  I guess it may be more conditional and take us slightly out of the box in which we find ourselves.  So, again, my  suggestion would be, “If circumstances were to evolve in a way that indicates that such transactions would be particularly effective,” though I think it is ideal that we not find ourselves in the situation of pondering and debating in the public square.  Given where we are, I think that is the best alternative we can do at this moment.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 422.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply expressing gratitude towards President Rosengren.


Passage number 423.
 MR. ROSENGREN. I just want to make an observation that, if we are going to have the economic projections come out at the same time, the public doesn’t read the Greenbook, but it does look at our projections. Between now and October the inflation forecast will dramatically change. If we are doing the long-run projections at the same time, the biggest bar is going to be at 2 percent, and our forecast is going to say that virtually none of us thinks we will get there in three years. So in terms of being factually accurate, we should at least think about the implications of our economic projections coming out at the same time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply making an observation and suggesting that the Federal Reserve should consider the implications of their economic projections being released at the same time as the inflation forecast.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 424.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. To complicate this even further, on the one hand this would be a change from December, and there has not been a big change, in our view, since December.  On the other hand, Debbie points out to me that the minutes from the December meeting had exactly this sentence about inflation—that some members saw significant risks that inflation could decline and persist for a time at uncomfortably low levels, and then similar language that relates to being below the sustainable level, and so on.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that on one hand, it is a change from December, while on the other hand, Debbie points out that the December meeting had exactly the same sentence about inflation. This suggests a disagreement or difference in opinion regarding the significance of the change.


Passage number 425.
 MR. LACKER. I had a friendly amendment to Governor Warsh.  “If evolving circumstances were to indicate” seems more parsimonious.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is offering a suggestion (friendly amendment) to Governor Warsh and stating that using the phrase "if evolving circumstances were to indicate" would be more concise or parsimonious. This does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 426.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right. We are going to have to review all of these things in the end here. Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they will need to review certain things.


Passage number 427.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I am marginally favoring A with B4 or B with A2 and 3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and stating their preference, but there is no indication of any conflicting or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 428.
 [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let’s go through that again. PARTICIPANT. But only marginally.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The laughter and the participant's response indicate a light and amicable tone in the conversation. The response "but only marginally" suggests a minor adjustment or clarification is needed, without any outright disagreement.


Passage number 429.
  [Laughter] MS. DUKE.  Marginally. I could be perfectly happy with B.  I think the difference is that it is not so much that we don’t know yet that we are going to have to do something more.  It is that we don’t know yet what that something more is likely to be.  The uncertainties that are in my mind and those that have been expressed are likely to be resolved by the time of our next meeting, such as the shape and the effect of the fiscal stimulus; the strategy for dealing with weaknesses in the banking system, including whether it is going to be additional capital injections, an aggregator bank, or nationalization; the pace of bank closures; and the strategy for dealing with distressed mortgages and foreclosures and, more important, our role in whatever that strategy is likely to be.  If our balance sheet is not required to take problem assets from the bank balance sheets, it may very well be required to provide loans for the subsequent purchases of either those assets or the underlying collateral.  Finally, with respect to commercial real estate, I think that we still need to investigate the structure of the commercial MBS and their relationship with servicers to see if we are going to have the same modification issues that we have had with residential mortgages.  So with all of those unknowns that are likely to be resolved in the short term, again, I am marginally happier with conveying the rationale for greater action but not yet identifying that action. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: In this passage, the speaker is expressing their own thoughts and uncertainties about the future actions they need to take. There is no explicit disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 430.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. 


Passage number 431.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We have been discussing whether we should embark on a long-term Treasury purchase program or whether we shouldengage in a greater magnitude or duration of agency MBS purchases.  I am not sure these really are the next and best escalation options.  Not surprisingly, I agree with the staff memo on long­term Treasuries, since I helped write it.  [Laughter]  I think the TALF expansion really is probably our next and best escalation option, but we are not prepared to do that quite at this time because we have to do that hand in hand with the Treasury.  So I want to agree with Governor Warsh that this is probably a time for temporizing. It seems clear to me that we do want to continue to expand our liquidity facilities, but to do so we have to satisfy a number of criteria.  I would argue that there are five criteria that any liquidity expansion should satisfy.  First, the market in question needs to be dysfunctional, and we might measure that by lack of liquidity, higher spreads, and lower volumes.  Two, the dysfunction has to be tightening financial conditions.  There needs to be a fairly direct link between the market in which we are intervening and economic activity.  Also, if there is a clear alternative source of funds, then intervention may not be warranted.  Third, we need to be confident that our facilities are likely to be helpful in improving market function and easing financial conditions. The goal should not be to displace markets but instead to provide support that primes markets to function better.  I think the CPFF is a good example in that respect.  Fourth, we need to be comfortable that we will indeed be secure to our satisfaction.  Fifth, we have to be comfortable that exit from these programs can be managed to avoid any conflict with our dual mandate. The TALF program, especially if the Treasury provides us with some support on the balance sheet exit issue, appears to fit best with these criteria. If the TALF works as anticipated in restarting the consumer ABS market and bringing down AAA-rated ABS spreads, then we may wish, with the Treasury as partner adding additional TARP capital, to broaden it to other  asset classes that are also in distress.  In particular, the CMBS market and the nonconforming RMBS market appear to be very good candidates.  It is not just the financing related to new activity that matters but also the ability for maturing debt to be refinanced.  This is a particularly important issue in both commercial real estate and nonconforming residential mortgage markets.  I believe the TALF program is very important because it provides three elements that are not broadly available to private investors right now—(1) term funding, (2) leverage and balance sheet capacity, and (3) protection against tail risk.  The TALF would bypass banks and dealers and provide balance sheet capacity directly to risk capital—capacity that today is unavailable because of the deleveraging that is taking place among banks and dealers and making them much less willing to extend such credit. It also provides protection against tail risk.  Because the financing is done on a nonrecourse basis, the most an investor can lose is the size of the haircut.  In this sense, although the TALF program is a lending program, one can also consider it to be a contingent purchase program.  In very bad states of the world in which AAA-rated consumer ABS tranches decline sharply in value, these securities will be put to the Federal Reserve and placed in an SPV capitalized by TALF money. The second issue I want to talk about is the exit issue.  Although I agree that this is a very important topic, I wonder how helpful it is to worry about this publicly, for two reasons.  First, anxiety expressed by us about the exit issue may fan fears that we will not be able to exit smoothly and avoid an inflation problem.  If market participants were broadly to share this opinion, the result could be higher risk premiums and tighter financial market conditions.  Second, the more we express concern with exit and our balance sheet, the more we may alter expectations about how much we are willing to do to support the economy.  I think we should err on the side of reinforcing the message that the FOMC will do all it can to ease financial  conditions and stimulate the economy.  Worrying publicly about the balance sheet seems to undercut that goal to some degree.  At the same time, we should work aggressively to make sure that our balance sheet will not interfere with the appropriate conduct of monetary policy later, and we should clearly explain to the public our ability to do so. In terms of the statement, I prefer alternative B language generally, but I would suggest two alterations. In paragraph 2, the language that “the outlook for the economy remains weak” seems too mild to me and could be taken by market participants as sounding complacent.  I prefer the language from alternative A, which states that “the economy has weakened somewhat more than anticipated,” which I believe is factually correct and provides greater information about how the data are coming in relative to our forecast.  I also think it signals greater concern by the Committee about the outlook, which is where the Committee actually is in terms of thinking about policy going forward. The second alteration I would suggest in alternative B is where we are talking about the implementation of the TALF.  We say “next month” in alternative B.  Given that our ability to enact this program is subject to some degree to the Treasury’s coming along with us in a timely fashion, I think it would be better to change “next month” to “later this winter,” which will give us until March 21, giving us a few more weeks.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing various options and criteria for expanding liquidity facilities, as well as expressing their preference for certain language in a statement. They also discuss the exit issue and suggest a slight alteration to the timing of the implementation of a program. However, there is no explicit disagreement or conflict present in the passage.


Passage number 432.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That last thing worries me quite a bit.  I don’t know. What did we have in December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a worry and uncertainty about a specific topic.


Passage number 433.
MR. LACKER. “Later this season.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker may be referring to a future event or time frame, but there is no clear indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 434.
” MR. WARSH.  How about “later”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage because the statement "How about 'later'" does not express any conflicting opinions or opposing arguments. It is a neutral question that seeks clarification or consideration of the concept of "later."


Passage number 435.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER. “In the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any statements or arguments that could indicate contention or disagreement. The use of "[Laughter]" suggests a light and amicable tone, rather than one characterized by disagreement.


Passage number 436.
” MR. MADIGAN. Another possibility might be just to say “soon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement present in the given passage. The speaker is suggesting an alternative approach or option, which does not indicate any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 437.
”  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I thought of that as well, but does that satisfy you there, Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 438.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I think “later this winter” does provide an endpoint.  I am not sure how long “soon” is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that they believe "later this winter" provides a clear endpoint, but they admit uncertainty about the duration of "soon."


Passage number 439.
 MR. WARSH.  It is always winter somewhere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "It is always winter somewhere" is a factual statement and does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 440.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We have a lot to go through here.  So just to get factual information here, my understanding from the staff was that we were well on track to implement during February, and I have heard nothing from the Treasury to indicate anything other than support for this program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that they have not received any indication from the Treasury opposing the program, indicating support and agreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 441.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes, I think that is correct, although the Treasury right now is scrambling to get their new staff up and running.  So there is some risk that what had been agreed to by the old Treasury now needs to be sort of relitigated with the new Treasury.  That could delay our putting out a term sheet to market participants, which they really need to have several weeks ahead of time for this program to get up and operational.  I think there is a good chance that we are still going to be able to make February or certainly early March, but we probably want a bit of wiggle room there because we don’t have complete control of the process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage.

The contention arises from the fact that the new Treasury staff might need to go through the previously agreed upon terms again, potentially delaying the process. This uncertainty and lack of control over the process creates room for disagreement or conflicting perspectives on the timeline for implementation.


Passage number 442.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Are you okay with “will soon implement”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 443.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes. I would prefer “winter,” but I can live with that.  “Soon” is factually correct. If we take a broad view of what “soon” means—yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 444.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right. Okay.  Brian, let’s accept that one, unless— President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrases "All right" and "Okay" indicate acceptance and agreement.


Passage number 445.
 MR. FISHER. Can’t we just say, “The Federal Reserve will be implementing”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting a way to phrase a statement.


Passage number 446.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right. Is that okay with everybody.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for confirmation or agreement from the group.


Passage number 447.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. To not specify it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any specific information or claim that could be a subject of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 448.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right.  “The Federal Reserve will be implementing.”  Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for the useful comments.  Let me try to address a few other things here. I think we are very much in agreement on the substance—that we want to maintain an aggressive stance. I also would just say, as a general point, that I fully agree—and I am sure everyone does—that we want to look for better metrics and better ways of communicating and expressing.  As a general invitation to all of you and your staffs, you don’t have to wait until the next meeting, and you don’t have to wait until the week before the next meeting.  We are delighted to hear explicit proposals for metrics or communication or statements that you would like to circulate, and we can discuss throughout the entire intermeeting period.  There is no need for us to wait until the last minute.  So let me just encourage you to follow through with that, and let us see your proposals. There have been a number of suggestions.  In the spirit of temporizing, I do believe that, although we want to convey our concern about the economy and our willingness to be aggressive with policy, there really is a high likelihood that we will learn a great deal in the next intermeeting period about what the Treasury will be proposing, what the Congress will be proposing, and what our role will best be fitting into those overall ideas.  Therefore, hearing you, I am a bit reluctant to commit at this moment to a specific increase in either our GSE or our Treasury purchase program.  Perhaps we should have made more explicit yesterday what our plan was going to be. So I would prefer to maintain the optionality of alternative B, which talks about standing ready both to expand the GSE program and to purchase Treasuries under the appropriate circumstances, and I will come back to that.   The second set of suggestions had to do with the characterization of the economy and inflation. There are two in particular.  One was whether to characterize the economy as weak or weakened somewhat more than anticipated.  I am actually a little surprised to hear the support for “weaker than anticipated” in that the Greenbook has not really changed much since December and the thrust of the commentary was that things were weak but not much weaker than anticipated. I am in your hands.  I am going to be taking some straw votes in a few minutes, so this is just a question. My sense on that one is that I could consider different language, but it seems as though “the outlook remains weak” conveys our view.  I am not sure that I have heard that the outlook itself has changed significantly since our last meeting.  That was my sense, but I am willing to be instructed on that.  On the statement about inflation being below the level consistent with economic growth and price stability, a number of people suggested that.  I think I am okay with that.  It was introduced in the minutes.  What I am going to do in a minute—let me just warn you—is take a couple of straw votes, and I will ask all participants to tell me whether you would like to add that sentence or not. I don’t know any other way to resolve this, since I personally think we could go either way. Other issues—I think it is a very interesting suggestion to move the material about the federal funds rate into paragraph 4.  I wish that you had sent that in a week ago so we could have thought about it. I think it makes sense, but I guess at the last minute here I am a bit anxious about making that big a change in the structure of our statement.  But I reiterate our interest in hearing proposals for statements throughout the intermeeting period. On the issue about Treasuries—it is difficult in both directions.  President Plosser raises the question about raising a possibility and then not doing it, which is certainly an issue.  On the other hand, we have also been criticized for calling audibles on the line at the last minute and surprising people. So it is difficult.  Based on the discussion and on things that President Lacker said, and so on, I think it is in fact a possibility that we would take this route.  I personally think that we shouldn’t rule it out.  It is not something we want to undertake yet because we certainly want to find out what the other options are going to be in terms of the other things that the Treasury is proposing and so on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging agreement and expressing willingness to consider suggestions.


Passage number 449.
 MR. PLOSSER. Mr. Chairman, on that point—it does concern me that this is a bit of a conundrum about how we do the statements, but I would be more comfortable with the language that Governor Warsh suggested, which gives a little more conditionality to it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, expresses his concern and states that he would be more comfortable with the language suggested by Governor Warsh. However, this does not imply any disagreement or contention between them.


Passage number 450.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I was diagramming that sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply stating what they were doing. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this statement.


Passage number 451.
  [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER. I am sorry.  I didn’t even write it down.  It just sounded better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply apologizing for not writing something down and explaining that it sounded better without giving further details.


Passage number 452.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as simplified by President Lacker, it was “is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances were to indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective.”  I think that’s three subjunctives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply presents a quote from President Lacker, explaining the Federal Reserve's stance on purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.


Passage number 453.
  [Laughter] MR. WARSH.  I think the Lacker suggestion is “if circumstances were to indicate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of "[Laughter]" indicates that it is a lighthearted or humorous moment, but it does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 454.
” MR. LACKER. Right. Oh, I didn’t take out “evolving,” but I am indifferent on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker simply states that he is indifferent about the word "evolving," suggesting that he does not have a strong opinion regarding its inclusion or removal.


Passage number 455.
  “Evolving” seems to emphasize— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. But see, the purpose of “evolving” is the sense that—don’t you want to convey the optionality that this is going to take place and will be evaluated over time.  The word “evolving” suggests an ongoing process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is explaining the purpose and connotations of the word "evolving" without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 456.
 MR. WARSH.  The delta is, Are the evolving circumstances going to evolve as we presume, in which case we have pre-committed to it.  Or is our decision going to be based on whether the evolving circumstances change in one way, which then triggers our “yes”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It discusses a potential scenario and mentions two possible outcomes without expressing any conflicting opinions or disagreement between parties.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 457.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, Governor Warsh, there is an “if” here.  I mean, that certainly implies that our action is conditional on certain things happening that may or may not happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 
The statement suggests that there is a condition or uncertainty regarding the action being discussed. The phrase "certain things happening that may or may not happen" indicates a level of contention or disagreement about the potential outcomes.


Passage number 458.
 MR. WARSH.  May I use a life line. [Laughter]  Brian, do you read it, as written, to say that we have reached a decision and our decision is contingent upon facts of the world in the future or that we have reached a decision and, if the world proceeds as we expect it will, then we will do this.  I am not sure I picked up from your introduction which you think you and markets would read.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the use of laughter, indicating a lighthearted tone, and the speaker's request for clarification and understanding. The passage suggests that the speaker is seeking clarification and is unsure about the interpretation of the information presented.


Passage number 459.
 MR. MADIGAN. I read this as saying that we don’t know how the circumstances will evolve, but if they evolve in the way that indicates that this would be particularly helpful, then we are prepared to purchase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply explains that if the circumstances evolve in a certain way, the speaker is prepared to purchase.


Passage number 460.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, for example, one possible theory would be that we will respond only if there is a big backup in rates and that seems to be an effective approach.  That would be an example of evolving circumstances.  My guess is—though it is always foolish to make guesses—that this will be viewed as slightly negative news, not positive news, for the Treasury market.  We will have to see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of speculative statements and suggestions.


Passage number 461.
 MR. WARSH.  I would say that Treasury markets are sort of 50/50 on when we are going to go forward. So this is really the question: Does it go 55/45 or vice versa.  It is hard to know. I think the sense is that the more they read the “if” to be an “if,” the more conditional it is and the more consensus there is around the table, Mr. Chairman.  So it is really just whether we think that there is sufficient conditionality as written or whether the Lacker–Warsh thing adds to the conditionality.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply expressing their uncertainty about the future and discussing different possibilities without any conflicting opinions being expressed.


Passage number 462.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I fear that taking out “evolving” actually reduces the clarity because “evolving” implies an ongoing process.  Without the word “evolving,” it suggests that we are still evaluating the current situation and then trying to assess whether the conditions are met to take the action.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a concern about clarity and offering an explanation for their fear. Their explanation is not in disagreement with any other perspective or argument.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 463.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, the action words are “prepared to purchase.”  Are we going to maintain those in there, or would we change it, keep “evolving,” and put “will consider purchasing”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, suggests a change by replacing "prepared to purchase" with "will consider purchasing." This implies a disagreement about the wording to be used in the passage.


Passage number 464.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, we already have a number of subjunctives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a fact and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 465.
 MR. FISHER. I think it is the “prepared to purchase” that indicates a decision made, and that is the phrase that bothers me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is expressing his concern about a specific phrase ("prepared to purchase"), but there is no apparent disagreement or opposing viewpoint expressed in the passage.


Passage number 466.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. One reason that I was comfortable with this language was that I do think that we will not be maintaining the world in suspended animation indefinitely.  We will have much more clarity, I believe, by the next meeting, and at the next meeting we would be able to say something like “the Federal Reserve will be focusing its attention on X, Y, or Z.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own belief and comfort with a certain language. They are stating that they believe there will be more clarity in the future which will allow the Federal Reserve to focus on specific areas.


Passage number 467.
” MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, I think putting the “particularly” in there actually steps us back a little, despite the “is prepared to.”  It is an “if” clause already.  I don’t see how “if circumstances were to indicate” is different from “if evolving circumstances indicate,” particularly with the “particularly” in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kohn is simply expressing his opinion about the wording of a certain clause, but he does not present any disagreement or argument with anyone else.


Passage number 468.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. And I don’t want to pull back completely because I do think there is a realistic possibility—and I realize that there are different views—that it is going to evolve over time.  We still have a lot of discussion and further thinking to do, not only about the specific types of purchases and programs but also about how we are going to evaluate the overall thrust of policy, and so on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges that there are different views and acknowledges that further discussion and thinking is needed.


Passage number 469.
 MR. WARSH.  To conflate game shows, I don’t want to be voted off the island.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses their desire not to mix game shows and being voted off the island, indicating a personal preference.


Passage number 470.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right. Have I addressed the major questions.  I don’t know. Okay.  What I would like to do is propose alternative B with two issues that we will now take a straw vote on.  The one change we have agreed on so far is “the Federal Reserve will be implementing the TALF.”  The other two possible changes have to do with the characterization of the economy. The first one would be in B2, to replace the first sentence with the first sentence from A2, “suggests that the economy has weakened somewhat more than anticipated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker asks if they have addressed the major questions and then proposes an alternative plan with two possible changes. It does not indicate any conflicting opinions or disagreement.


Passage number 471.
” MR. EVANS. Mr. Chairman, it is the “anticipated.”  Couldn’t we just say, “The economy has weakened further”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply suggesting an alternative phrasing for the statement "The economy has weakened further" by using the term "anticipated."


Passage number 472.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, there is a distinction between the outlook and the economy itself.  The outlook remains weak.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is a distinction between the outlook and the economy and that the outlook remains weak.


Passage number 473.
 MR. EVANS. In this case, it doesn’t say “outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply a statement made by Mr. Evans.


Passage number 474.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right. Well, do you want to say, “The economy has weakened somewhat further”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement asking for the speaker's opinion on the current state of the economy.


Passage number 475.
   MR. EVANS. That would be okay with me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that the suggestion would be okay with them.


Passage number 476.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto, do you have a view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply asks President Pianalto if she has a view on something.


Passage number 477.
 MS. PIANALTO. That sounds fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that something "sounds fine," without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 478.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. How about “suggests that the economy has weakened further”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase simply provides a suggestion without any clear indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 479.
 MR. KOHN. What do we have about the outlook then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question asking about the outlook.


Passage number 480.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No one seemed to object to the last sentence, which gives a recovery but with downside risks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that no one objected to the last sentence, indicating a lack of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 481.
 MR. KOHN. But it doesn’t have a sense that the outlook is weak until that recovery.  I have to think about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Kohn expresses his opinion ("I have to think about this") but does not express any disagreement or contention with anyone.


Passage number 482.
 The outlook remains weak, and there is— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I think “weakened further” is not dangerous.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It states that the outlook remains weak and shares the opinion that the phrase "weakened further" is not dangerous.


Passage number 483.
 MR. KOHN. Okay. So it’s the economy rather than the outlook that has weakened further.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that the economy has weakened further, without expressing any conflicting opinions or ideas.


Passage number 484.
 MR. EVANS. It is as mild as saying we have stepped from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, which is going to be a contraction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating an opinion or observation about transitioning from one quarter to another, noting that there will be a contraction in the first quarter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 485.
 MR. LACKER. I’m sorry.  I missed what’s on the table.  Is it that the economy has weakened further or that the outlook has weakened further.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses confusion about what is being discussed and requests clarification. This suggests a disagreement or lack of agreement on the topic or information being presented.


Passage number 486.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot answer without the passage.


Passage number 487.
 MR. LACKER. The economy.  Okay. That makes sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply acknowledges that the topic of discussion, the economy, makes sense.


Passage number 488.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. So I hear a slight preference for—okay, Brian— “suggests that the economy has weakened further.” All right. The last question, then, is whether or not to add or replace B3 with A3.  That would add the sentence that “the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability.”  I propose to take a straw vote of all of the participants—not just members but participants.  All those in favor of making the change.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  All opposed.  One, two, three, four, five, six. All right. I think it is a reasonable change.  I don’t think it is dramatic.  Any other comments.  All right. I guess we have made three changes now.  I propose alternative B. I think it conveys the sense of the Committee.  It maintains, as much as possible, our optionality while suggesting that we are going to be aggressive.  Again, we will be looking both to the Treasury and to the government for their actions over the next intermeeting period.  Once again, I invite members and other participants to submit their suggestions for communication and measurement over the intermeeting period. I probably should mention that there will be opportunities for us to communicate about our views further. In particular, I have a testimony on February 10 on our transparency and our communication. I have a speech at the National Press Club, which will have more of a press conference type of flavor, sort of between a speech and a press conference, on February 18.  Then, I have the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings, followed by Budget Committee hearings, so you will be seeing a lot of me on television.  My complexion is not usually green but probably will be by then. [Laughter] So we will have a chance to communicate.  And I hope that each of you, in your own speeches and other interactions with the public, will take as much of the opportunity as you can to try to explain what we are doing, how we are thinking about the economy, and how we are thinking about our policy in this unusual environment.  Any other comments.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No - There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking input and suggestions from the participants and then making a proposal based on their feedback.


Passage number 489.
 MR. FISHER. I just want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the spirit in which we have conducted these conversations in this meeting.  As you know, at least of some of us felt that we might be disenfranchised.  You may be enfranchising us too much.  [Laughter] But we appreciate it.  At least speaking for myself, I want to thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and appreciation for the way the conversations and meeting have been conducted. The mention of feeling disenfranchised is a lighter comment meant to add humor, rather than expressing actual disagreement.


Passage number 490.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. All right. If we are ready for a roll call vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a statement acknowledging that a roll call vote is about to take place.


Passage number 491.
 MS. DANKER. Would you like me to read the statement, as amended.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. The question is simply asking if the person would like the statement to be read with the proposed amendments.


Passage number 492.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don’t you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple question, without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 493.
 MS. DANKER. Okay. “The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.   Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending.  Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly.  Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight.  The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economy activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant.   In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.   The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  The focus of the Committee’s policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities ofagency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.  The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  The Federal Reserve will be implementing the term asset-backed securities loan facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.” This vote will also encompass the directive from page 48 of the Bluebook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements that indicate disagreement or contention. It is a statement from the Federal Open Market Committee about their decision on the federal funds rate and their assessment of the economy.


Passage number 494.
Chairman Bernanke Yes  Vice Chairman Dudley Yes  Governor Duke Yes  President Evans Yes  Governor Kohn Yes  President Lacker No  President Lockhart Yes  Governor Warsh Yes  President Yellen Yes  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very much.  A couple of other small items.  Item 11 is the longer-run projections.  Many of you commented.  I heard no concerns about it, so why don’t we go ahead and—President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement indicated in this passage. All the individuals mentioned are stated as agreeing or having no concerns about the longer-run projections.


Passage number 495.
 MR. LACKER. I pointed out yesterday that the distribution of the numbers for inflation had shifted notably. I understand that people’s views about the appropriate inflation rate—the steady-state inflation rate that they would put in a Taylor rule or some other reaction function—might change from quarter to quarter.  I also pointed out that I thought the motivation for doing that was dissatisfaction with the extent to which the third year of our forecast inflation changed from quarter to quarter and that it diminished the extent to which that report of our forecasts served as a proxy for our Committee’s agreed-upon numerical inflation objectives.  At our last meeting, we discussed adopting an explicit numerical inflation objective.  That hasn’t appeared on the agenda today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their perspective and previous discussions on inflation objectives.


Passage number 496.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I was about to report.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker was about to report something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 497.
 MR. LACKER. Oh, okay. I guess my attitude toward the longer-run projections is that I remain unconvinced, as I was in our October discussion, that the benefits exceed the costs, and I wanted to use the opportunity here to ask about the status of adopting a numerical objective for inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses disagreement with the longer-run projections and challenges the idea that the benefits of adopting a numerical objective for inflation exceed the costs.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 498.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I agree with you that this has disadvantages and advantages relative to a formal target.  Absolutely. I wanted to thank everybody for the very useful discussion that we had in the videoconference, and I promise not to have a full discussion of inflation targets any time soon because I do think we do have a pretty good sense of people’s views. What I took from the conference call, among other things, was that the Committee was willing to grant me some discretion to try to discuss with the political bodies what their views would be on going forward with an explicit objective.   As I mentioned to you even before the meeting, I had spoken to the Administration, and I have had some follow-up discussions there.  My sense is that there would not be any serious opposition from that side, although I need to continue to talk with them.  But the more difficult question is on the congressional side, and I have a meeting with Barney Frank on Monday, in which I will raise this issue among other issues.  My sense of the meeting was that it was worthdoing some socializing and some exploring of these issues but that we wanted to be very careful and very sensitive at this difficult juncture about not creating new political problems for ourselves but only if we can persuade the leaders of the country that this is something constructive.  So I will continue to try to do that and continue to work on this.  I do think, frankly, that this continued expansion of our projections actually makes it much easier to sell because it creates a context in which the Congress can see that this is only part of a program that involves meeting both parts of our mandate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there may be opposition from the congressional side regarding the issue of explicit objectives for inflation targets. They mention having a meeting with Barney Frank to address this issue among others.


Passage number 499.
 MR. LACKER. I see. Mr. Chairman, do you view it as feasible, likely, or very unlikely that consultations could result in your Monetary Policy Report to the Congress this season involving a revelation of an objective. Or is that too much to hope for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a question posed by Mr. Lacker to the Chairman.


Passage number 500.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I don’t know.  I will have to see. It will depend a lot on the reaction I get from a few key people.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 501.
 MR. LACKER. Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is thanking the chairman for something, but there is no indication of any disagreement or contention between them.


Passage number 502.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman, did you have a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply asks Vice Chairman if they have a comment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 503.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes. I guess I am somewhat less than fully enthusiastic about publishing long-term projections at this time.  I could support it, but I just want to make a couple of points. First, I think it is a somewhat awkward time to introduce long-term projections. Our forecasts are almost certainly going to be very wrong, given the level of uncertainty. Moreover, long-term projections may be viewed by market participants as off point.  The economy is sinking rapidly, yet the FOMC is spending its time constructing forecasts for 2011 and beyond. Second, if the goal is to introduce long-term projections to communicate the Committee’s views about parameters such as the NAIRU, the potential growth rate, and the desired level of  inflation, wouldn’t it be better to simply proceed and publish those measures rather than long­term projections, which are just an approximation of those parameters. Third, I think the individual long-term projections are difficult to link back to the projections for 2011.  If one of the primary objectives of the long-term projections is to provide some background for how the projections past 2011 will converge to the Committee’s goals, you might want to consider different ways of constructing the central tendency forecast. Fourth, I worry a little about what happens when the composition of the FOMC changes.  The long-term projections that result might change because of changes in the composition, not because of an underlying change in view by individual members.  I think it would be hard for market participants to know how to judge those changes over time, quarter to quarter, as the projections evolve. So I can support it, but I am not enthusiastic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows disagreement and a lack of enthusiasm towards publishing long-term projections. The author raises concerns about the timing of introducing long-term projections, the accuracy and relevance of the forecasts, the difficulty in linking the projections back to current goals, and the potential impact of changes in the composition of the FOMC on the projections. While the author admits being able to support it, they do not express enthusiasm for the idea.


Passage number 504.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you for that.  Again, I think we see that there are both advantages and disadvantages of doing this.  I guess I would disagree only slightly on the issue of timing in that, to the extent that this does give some sense of what the Committee’s preferences are on appropriate monetary policy over the longer term, certainly an issue that has come around the table quite a bit is the need to stabilize inflation expectations in a situation where they might be quite potentially unstable in either direction.  So that is one consideration. President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, the speaker is acknowledging the existence of both advantages and disadvantages, but there is no direct disagreement or contention with anyone else's opinion. The speaker does mention a slight disagreement on the issue of timing, but it is not a major point of contention.


Passage number 505.
 MR. EVANS. May I make just one quick point.  President Lacker mentioned that there was some concern about changes in the inflation long-term projection on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I don’t interpret the distribution that way.  It seems to me as though it was probably importantly influenced by our discussion at the videoconference, and it was a one-off type of   change. I know I changed my forecast from 1¾ to 2 percent.  I had previously felt constrained that 1¾ was pretty much a Committee consensus midpoint, and so I figured we would be acting that way. But now, with more people thinking it was 2, that was how I changed it.  I get a sense that others around the table may have done the same thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans is simply expressing his interpretation of the inflation long-term projection and sharing his own change in forecast based on the discussion at the videoconference.


Passage number 506.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It seemed to be noted that the mode is 2, and so the majority believe that 2 is the right number, and there are arguments for allowing a slightly higher target given the recent experience. Other comments about the projections or inflation targets.  Well, with the caveats that were raised, I still believe that there was a general view that we ought to go ahead with the longer-term projections as part of the summary that will be published along with the minutes.  So why don’t we do that. I have updated you on inflation targets, which is still really at just the discussion stage. Let me just ask you quickly—this was our first experiment with the somewhat modified meeting structure—either now or in the intermeeting period, give us your feedback or comments about the effectiveness of this structure.  Also, if we are going to have an issue in a one-day context, we are going to have find ways to condense parts of the discussion some way or another, perhaps by sending out materials in advance.  Is there anyone who would like to comment at this point about the meeting structure or make suggestions.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It mainly consists of statements and requests for feedback and suggestions.


Passage number 507.
 MR. ROSENGREN. I wonder if we should have two-day meetings until we get into a more status quo situation. Rather than shortening the meetings, I think it was actually quite productive to have the discussion.  We might want to think about whether two-day meetings, until we get more clarity as to what policy should be going forward, would be helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren is suggesting having two-day meetings instead of shortening them in order to have more productive discussions and gain clarity on future policy.
