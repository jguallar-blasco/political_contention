Passage number 1.
 Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting of June 24-25, 2008   June 24, 2008—Afternoon Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Why don’t we begin, as usual, with the Desk report and Bill Dudley.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a transcript of a meeting, so it is simply stating the agenda and does not contain any arguments or disagreements.


Passage number 2.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Bill.  The quarter-end premium seems less this time, but am I correct that the dollar premium is higher than the euro and pound premiums.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is acknowledging that the quarter-end premium seems less this time, but it is also asking for confirmation about the dollar premium being higher than the euro and pound premiums. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 3.
 MR. DUDLEY.  It is a bit higher, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that something is higher, without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 4.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is there anything to be inferred from that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply asks a question without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or disagreements. It is a neutral inquiry seeking information or clarification.


Passage number 5.
 MR. DUDLEY.  About 225 basis points are priced in for our dollar turn—maybe 150 basis points or 175 basis points elsewhere—but those are pretty small differences measured over just a couple of days.  So I wouldn’t read too much into it.  The reality is that the European banks are structurally short of dollar funding, and so that may be why there is a little more upward pressure on dollar rates over the quarter-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information about dollar rates and the potential reasons for upward pressure on them.


Passage number 6.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there are other questions for Bill and mentions President Lacker.


Passage number 7.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I notice that in chart 18, in your TIPS-implied average inflationary plot to the ten-year horizon, you omit the Markets Group’s estimate.  Is that because of skepticism on your part that leads you to judge it as inferior or an overabundance of humility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The question asked by Mr. Lacker is simply seeking clarification as to why the Markets Group's estimate is omitted from the plot. There is no indication of skepticism or judgments of inferiority or overabundance of humility.


Passage number 8.
  [Laughter] MR. DUDLEY.  The latter, of course.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The laughter is likely indicating a friendly or humorous atmosphere. The response of "The latter, of course" seems to be a continuation or agreement with a previous statement.


Passage number 9.
  [Laughter]   MR. LACKER.  It does, of course, show a slightly different trend, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It introduces a statement followed by laughter, and then someone agrees and acknowledges the slight difference in trend.


Passage number 10.
 MR. DUDLEY.  It actually has increased a bit.  But I have consistently shown just the Barclays and Board measures over the past few months, so this is not “pick and choose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is straightforward and does not involve any conflicting opinions or conflicting information. It is a simple response to a question about whether something has increased.


Passage number 11.
”  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information or context about President Fisher, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 12.
 MR. FISHER.  Bill, by inference, talking about the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, two of the limited number of borrowers have been the two institutions you mentioned.  Have there been many more or just one or two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply asks for clarification about the number of borrowers in the Primary Dealer Credit Facility without expressing any dispute or conflicting views.


Passage number 13.
 MR. DUDLEY.  There have been more borrowers than just them.  Some have done it because they wanted to test the facility.  Some have done it because they viewed it as a fairly advantageous cost of funding.  You know, there have been quite a few different borrowers, but those two borrowers mentioned are the ones that I would view as more persistent than desired.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage simply states the opinion of Mr. Dudley that there have been more borrowers than just the two mentioned and that he views those two as more persistent than desired. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 14.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you for discreetly answering the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude for the person's discreet response to a question.


Passage number 15.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states that there are "other questions" and mentions President Plosser without providing any further information or indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 16.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just to follow up on that question, I was at a meeting in New York not too long ago and was talking with some people on Wall Street.  They suggested that for the primary dealers there was stigma attached to borrowing from the PDCF.  I wasn’t quite sure what to make of that, and I just wondered if you had any observations or comments about whether you thought that was real or perceived, or is there an interpretation I should give to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement about a conversation the speaker had with some people on Wall Street. The speaker is seeking the other person's observations or comments on the matter.


Passage number 17.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think there is some stigma attached to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.  It is hard to know exactly how much.  One thing I thought was interesting:  The first week the facility was outstanding, a number of institutions went to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and then announced that they were doing it as a test.  Now, presumably you wouldn’t announce that you were doing it as a test if there were no stigma associated with the facility.  But I would judge that it is clearly less stigmatized than the Primary Credit Facility, probably because it doesn’t have the history that the Primary Credit Facility has.  The fact is that it is an advantageous rate or was an advantageous rate several weeks ago, and there were some institutions that were borrowing from the facility just on the basis of rate—so that suggests less stigma than the discount window.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own observation and judgement about the stigma attached to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.


Passage number 18.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of thanks from Mr. Plosser.


Passage number 19.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, the passage does not mention any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 20.
 MR. STERN.  Yes.  Bill, on chart 6, just a quick question on the leverage ratio:  Do we know how good those data are.  I mean, to the best of our knowledge, is that reliable stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates disagreement or contention. Mr. Stern raises a question about the reliability of the data, suggesting doubt or uncertainty about its accuracy. This implies some disagreement or contention regarding the trustworthiness of the information.


Passage number 21.
 MR. DUDLEY.  This is just assets divided by equity, so I think it is pretty good.  When the investment banks start proposing their adjusted leverage ratios, then I think you have a problem—you know, apples and oranges—because the different investment banks calculate those kinds of adjusted leverage ratios a bit differently.  Usually you see two leverage ratios—one that is gross and another one that excludes the matched book—and the leverage ratio falls pretty significantly when you exclude the matched book.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is explaining the difference between two types of leverage ratios used by different investment banks. The speaker is simply stating that the calculation of adjusted leverage ratios varies among banks, which can make it difficult to compare them directly.


Passage number 22.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman.  President Stern, I have just one thing to add.  For the first time with the three investment banks that reported for the quarter that ended in May, the SEC allowed them to disclose their risk-weighted ratio on the SEC’s version of Basel II.  That’s the ratio for which your question is more germane in some sense because it shows a pretty significant cushion of capital against risk-weighted assets.  The question is, How good are those measures of risk-weighted assets.  This is a subject for discussion tomorrow, but part of our problem is that we have much less confidence in judging the integrity of what goes into those measures of risk—not to mention whether the risk weights are any good, which is a harder thing for the market to judge.  But for the first time the market can see what their risk-weighted measures are, at least on an SEC basis, which is pretty close to Basel II, and those ratios were, if I recall correctly, north of 10, tier 1, for the three that reported—significantly higher than they were on March 1, by their own measures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing information about the disclosure of risk-weighted ratio by the three investment banks and expressing some concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the measures.


Passage number 23.
 MR. STERN.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing gratitude by saying "thanks."


Passage number 24.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  If not, would someone move the ratification.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that there are other questions but does not indicate any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 25.
 MR. KOHN.  So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement or a request made by Mr. Kohn.


Passage number 26.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let’s turn now to the economic situation.  Nathan, I’ll start with you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrases "Without objection," "Thank you," and "Okay" indicate agreement and cooperation.


Passage number 27.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Brian.  Are there questions for our colleagues.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of polite and formal statements, with no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 28.
 MR. FISHER.  If I may, I would like to ask Nathan, Mr. Chairman, about exhibit 4 and exhibit 5.  Particularly noteworthy is that exhibit 4 is the forecast period showing a significant decline in inflation in the emerging market economies.  I am wondering what that is based on.  Do we have a sense of capacity utilization or slack, if it is all reliable, or is it based on a sense of commodity prices.  What is that noticeable down-swoop.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is simply asking for clarification and additional information about exhibit 4 and exhibit 5.


Passage number 29.
 MR. SHEETS.  You are asking particularly with respect to the emerging market economies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is a simple statement of fact or inquiry.


Passage number 30.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.  In the top left-hand panel.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Fisher is responding affirmatively to something.


Passage number 31.
 MR. SHEETS.  In the process of preparing our forecast, we do come up with estimates of slack for the emerging market economies, but we are not inclined to put a whole lot of weight on them.  The concept of an output gap is not really a well-defined construct for, say, China.  Nevertheless, these economies will be growing a little more slowly than they have in the past, and some of the pressures on resources associated with that growth may abate a bit.  I think that is at least a piece of the story of what you see here as the decline.  But at the end of the day, it has to be a story about commodity prices.  Food prices and energy prices have pushed this up.  Depending on exactly which emerging market economy you’re in, food prices will range anywhere from 25 percent to 33 percent of their basket.  As long as those food prices and energy prices are moving up dramatically, you are going to see rapid increases in inflation.  So the decline that you are seeing in this chart really is conditioned first and foremost on commodity prices flattening out.  I wish I had a better story.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their view and providing reasoning for the decline in inflation.


Passage number 32.
 MR. FISHER.  You don’t know how happy I am to see global things come first.  But are you saying that a great deal of uncertainty is attached to that forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 33.
 MR. SHEETS.  Oh, absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as the speaker agrees wholeheartedly with the statement.


Passage number 34.
 MR. FISHER.  Then, in exhibit 5 on core import prices, I guess it is pretty much the same answer.  One would expect that these would fall of their own weight after a while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 35.
 MR. SHEETS.  Yes.  The spike that we have seen is driven particularly by commodity prices.  The depreciation of the dollar has played a secondary role, so the decline in core import price inflation to below 2 percent next year is conditioned crucially on commodity prices flattening out and the dollar not depreciating as rapidly as it has over the past few years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 36.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, if I could ask just one other question—of Larry, I think it was—on the housing exhibits.  I am wondering if we are not in the eye of the storm here.  We have had the first wave of buckling at the knees—or worse, cascading.  If you talk to the homebuilders, they are, of course, the most depressed group imaginable.  But they are waiting for another shoe to drop, which is the foreclosures on alt-As.  I’m wondering what our opinion is on that.  Things have calmed down a bit, but we still have another phase of the storm coming through, which is what I just described.  What are our assumptions about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a speaker expressing their concern about a potential future issue.


Passage number 37.
 MR. SLIFMAN.  We expect foreclosures to rise—and to rise appreciably.  One thing we have done in thinking about house prices is, in effect, to build in some extra house-price depreciation, above and beyond what our price–rent model would want to say, to reflect the kinds of factors that you are talking about—the foreclosures, what that means then for the vacancy rate, and what that does to house prices, particularly in certain parts of the country.  I see President Yellen nodding her head because California, for sure, is one place where that could clearly be an important factor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a statement about an expected rise in foreclosures and the resulting effect on house prices. There is no evident contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 38.
  MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the passage. The person is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 39.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: "No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage provided.


Passage number 40.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to ask a question about inflation and labor compensation.  At the last meeting, many of us, myself included, mentioned that labor compensation had not been growing very strongly, and we took that as a possible comforting comment about inflationary pressures not being too strong.  That comment was in this presentation and yesterday’s, too.  Now, statistically, isn’t it the case that labor compensation is not really a good predictor of inflation.  It really tends to lag more.  So how should we think about interpreting that lack of acceleration for inflation expectations and pressures.  Feel free to dispute that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 41.
 MR. WASCHER.  No, I agree with you.  I think our models have been surprised by the low rates of compensation growth.  One way to think about it is that in the past we might have seen higher headline inflation passed through more quickly to compensation growth—as in the ’70s, when those wage–price spirals were really led by prices, but then wages contributed by following.  So far we haven’t seen any sign that higher headline inflation has been putting upward pressure on compensation costs.  I think there’s a risk.  We obviously included the simulation because we think there’s a risk that could happen in the future, but to date we have not seen evidence that that’s been the case.  There are a number of reasons to think that things now might be different than they used to be.  For example, just a structural reason, unions are less powerful than they used to be; a much smaller share of the work force is unionized.  In the 1970s there were all sorts of automatic cost-of-living adjustment clauses.  Even when there weren’t, there were big catch-ups for past inflation.  Another structural reason might be that the minimum wage was higher in the 1970s, and it is lower in real terms now.  I think more generally this fits in with the general notion that inflation expectations are less responsive to immediate shocks in headline inflation than perhaps they used to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker agrees with the idea that compensation growth has been low and explains possible reasons for this phenomenon.


Passage number 42.
 MR. STOCKTON.  From a forecasting perspective, President Evans, I think you’re right.  I don’t think models that rely simply on labor costs to predict prices are very sound in terms of their forecasting ability versus just a plain old price–price type of Phillips curve or a price type of Phillips curve augmented with price expectations.  Part of the reason may be that the compensation data themselves are just so poor that, in fact, it’s really a measurement problem.  It’s not that you would argue that labor costs, which are a very significant chunk of overall business costs, don’t matter.  I do think you can probably take, and we certainly have taken, some limited comfort from the fact that we have not yet seen an acceleration of labor costs.  That likely indicates that you are not seriously behind the curve already or that something is baked in the cake.  I don’t think you can necessarily take comfort from the well-behaved compensation thus far that you are not going to confront some inflation problems going forward.  It’s more that the compensation data don’t suggest that you’ve fallen seriously behind the curve.  In some sense we see the higher inflation expectations readings themselves, or at least some of the mixed-to-slightly-higher inflation expectations data, as suggesting that you’re facing a bit more of an inflationary difficulty over the next two years than we thought two months ago would be the case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 43.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions President Fisher without providing any information about contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 44.
 MR. FISHER.  Just a quick follow-up, Mr. Chairman.  To what extent do you impute the kind of insecurity that comes from competition and broader outsourcing.  If you impute anything there in terms of wage behavior here, to what extent are you assuming going forward that the increase in wages being paid elsewhere might bleed into our wage behavior here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: There is contention in the passage as Mr. Fisher is questioning the assumption made by the Chairman regarding the impact of competition and outsourcing on wages. He is asking about the extent to which the increase in wages in other places may affect wage behavior locally.


Passage number 45.
 MR. WASCHER.  Well, we don’t account for that in our compensation model.  That said, as I mentioned, the models have been surprised about how low compensation has been.  That would be one possible explanation for that residual.  If that factor were to diminish, it would imply that that residual would diminish, but we haven’t built such an effect into our forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that their compensation model does not account for certain factors and mentioning a possible explanation for the observed low compensation.


Passage number 46.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The phrase "Thank you" is simply an expression of gratitude and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 47.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information or statements that indicate contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are other questions, followed by the mention of President Bullard.


Passage number 48.
 MR. BULLARD.  I want to ask a question about exhibit 7, which talks about factors affecting the GDP forecast.  The second bullet point mentions judgmental adjustments, which were tempered this time relative to last time.  Last time I described this as a regime-switching model, and you said that was perhaps too much.  The economy sort of switches into this recession-like behavior, and we know that the economy might behave differently in that environment.  But do we now think the probability of switching into that behavior is smaller.  What is the forecast.  Is the forecast some kind of average between this high state and this low state.  That’s what you said here—it has tempered our judgmental adjustments.  It sounds as though there is less probability of switching into that state.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked by Mr. Bullard about the factors affecting the GDP forecast. There is a discussion of the previous description of a "regime-switching model" and the possibility of the economy behaving differently in a recession-like state. However, there is no overt disagreement or contention in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 49.
 MR. SLIFMAN.  It’s hard for me to think of it in these probabilistic terms.  I would say that we still think that the economy is going to have these negative effects that are associated with periods of low growth.  Now, whether that is precisely a recession or simply just a low-growth period, it’s hard for me to distinguish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Slifman, acknowledges that there will be negative effects associated with periods of low growth, but expresses uncertainty about whether it can be classified as a recession or just a low-growth period. This implies a lack of consensus or agreement on how to categorize the economic situation.


Passage number 50.
 MR. BULLARD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 51.
  But the rationale is that you switch into the recession and you get the correlations from— MR. SLIFMAN.  Yes.  The way to think about it is that we switched into a low-growth period.  Whether it is precisely a recession or just simply a low-growth period shouldn’t be the demarcation point.  We still think that the economy is operating in a low-growth period.  There is probably not as much severity to that low-growth period, but we still think that is where it’s operating.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there may be different interpretations regarding whether it is a recession or a low-growth period, but they ultimately agree that the economy is currently operating in a low-growth period.


Passage number 52.
 MR. BULLARD.  But then you’re switching into the low-growth period, and then we take the correlations for low-growth periods, which I guess are maybe not as severe as in recession periods.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Bullard, discussing the correlations during low-growth periods compared to recession periods.


Passage number 53.
 MR. SLIFMAN.  Just as a factoid to throw out here, one of my colleagues on the Board staff, Jeremy Nalewaik, has estimated some of these models looking at switching between high-growth periods and low-growth periods, where a low-growth period does not necessarily have to be a recession.  Using the GDP data through the first quarter plus our forecast for second-quarter GDP, which is now at an annual rate of 1.7 percent, his model still would suggest that there’s an 84 percent probability that the economy is operating in a low-growth state.  So I think that it was a fair thing for us to continue to have the judgmental adjustments, which by the way aren’t just recession-like effects.  They also include financial turmoil effects and some uncertainty things.  I think it’s a fair thing for us to have included those, but as I say, we’ve tempered them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting an estimate and discussing the rationale for including certain adjustments in the model.


Passage number 54.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information in the passage provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 55.
 MR. LACKER.  I want to make sure I understand what you just said.  Your response suggests that there’s a third state that’s even worse than we are in now, that one could possibly go into, and that what you’ve tempered is the probability that we’re in that worst state.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and confirmation of the previous statement made by the other person.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 56.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Again, we want to step back a bit from taking this regime-switching too seriously as implying that there are just two states of the world or maybe three states of the world.  There are lots of different states of the world.  What we are trying to do is look at the residuals in our spending equations and ask how they behave in various kinds of periods.  In periods with substantial increases in the unemployment rate, weak payroll employment, and big declines in consumer sentiment, there also are substantial negative residuals in our spending equations, particularly on the consumer spending side.  That is still built into this forecast.  So we have not interpreted the last six weeks of data as suggesting that recession concerns are all behind us, that we were just completely wrong, and that we are now on a much stronger growth path than we previously thought.  If, in fact, you’re worried that the incoming data might be signaling a stronger growth path, then I would take a look at the “upside risk” scenario that we show in the Greenbook.  There we take out all of our spending residuals—those that are incorporated because we thought we might be in this low-growth or recessionary-like state and the ones that are associated with financial turmoil—and you get growth in that case that is a little above potential growth and a path for the fed funds rate that is even steeper than the current market expectations. Now, although we kept these negative residuals in our forecast, we did have to acknowledge the fact that underlying aggregate demand appeared stronger than we thought it was going to be at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  There is an underlying strengthening of aggregate demand in this forecast that shows up as an increase in the equilibrium funds rate of roughly ½ percentage point.  So we’re trying to acknowledge the strength of the incoming data, but we want to be clear that this forecast still embeds some significant negative add-factors on spending going forward.  That could be wrong.  Maybe the incoming data are signaling that we are just fundamentally wrong about that aspect of the forecast.  As Larry showed, given the stunning decline in consumer sentiment, the continued weak business sentiment, and the fact that the unemployment rate has risen as much as it has and has done this in the past only in periods of recession, we felt comfortable still presenting you with a forecast that anticipates that aggregate demand is going to be very weak over the next several quarters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker mentions that there may be disagreement or uncertainty about the forecast and the impact of data on the predicted growth path. They acknowledge that the forecast still includes negative factors, but there is a possibility that the incoming data could indicate that they are fundamentally wrong about those factors.


Passage number 57.
 MR. LACKER.  I don’t want to belabor this too much.  I was curious about what you tempered.  I think President Bullard was looking for whether you tempered the probability on state 2.  I’m with you in not wanting to place a lot of probability on n states, but it sounds as though the growth trajectory—you know, the magnitude of the add-factors you were thinking of—has been drawn back a little.  Is that a fair characterization.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification on a specific point regarding the growth trajectory.


Passage number 58.
 MR. STOCKTON.  That’s correct—and the timing.  So there are two aspects.  One is that we have interpreted some of the surprise as a persistent strengthening in aggregate demand that we had not anticipated.  The other is that the economy is not as weak now, and therefore the bounceback in activity next year won’t be as strong.  As Larry said, there are a lot of moving parts, but both of those considerations are built into this forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is discussing two aspects that are both built into the forecast. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 59.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only includes the statement "Thank you," which is a polite response and does not show any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 60.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any other questions.  Okay.  We are about ready for our go-round.  Let me remind you about the proposal to add a long-term line to our projections.  The rationale for doing so is that the current system doesn’t necessarily let the public know what our views on the steady state of the economy are.  To show my own hand, I think it would be helpful to add maybe one line that said in five to seven years out what we think the economy would do.  But I think it is important for those of us who want to express an opinion to do so.  If there is interest, as Brian mentioned, we can do a trial run in October, and we won’t have to make a final decision about whether to go forward until October or December or perhaps later depending on how things go.  But if you have a view on that, please add that to your commentary.  So let’s begin with the economic go-round, and we’ll start with President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentions or disagreements. It is a discussion about the proposal to add a long-term line to projections and gathering opinions on the matter.


Passage number 61.
 MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I will begin my remarks this afternoon with a brief update on the conditions in our District.  Overall, District economic activity continues to expand moderately, with strengthened energy, agriculture, and export manufacturing more than offsetting the softness in our housing, retail sales, and other types of manufacturing activity.  District labor markets continue to perform reasonably well.  While job growth has slowed over the past few months, unemployment remains very low, and many sectors continue to have difficulty finding workers, especially skilled ones.  Evidence on wage pressures is mixed.  Although wage pressures have moderated somewhat in our Beige Book survey, some recent labor union contracts have built in rising profiles for hourly wage increases over the term of the contract.  Rising energy and commodity input prices are continuing to negatively affect our District economic activity. Reports from businesses suggest that higher energy and food prices are being quickly passed on to the customer now.  However, businesses are having mixed success in passing on other cost increases, resulting in some severe erosion in margins and profitability in some of the firms.  To illustrate some of the cost–price dynamics, I would like to take just a minute and relate the recent experience of one of our Branch directors, who operates a multi-line manufacturing firm.  I mention this because I am hearing it more and more.  In addition to rising fuel prices, his business has seen a doubling in steel costs since January, with July quotes on steel tubing up an additional 25 percent.  In response, his company recently announced a price increase of 16 to 18 percent across a range of products.  Competitors immediately matched or exceeded his price increases.  Notably, he made these price increases despite a decline in new orders in May.  He also noted that import prices from China that he has seen have risen 28 percent this year and that ocean freight prices have risen about 20 percent.  As a result, customers who previously bought Chinese products are now purchasing U.S.-manufactured goods.  It is interesting—I talked with some of the folks at Union Pacific, and their shipments into the Midwest have dropped slightly, but their shipments out have increased about 3 to 4 percent.  So that is what is going on in the region.   More broadly, turning to the national economy, I have revised up my growth estimate for the first half of 2008, but it has made little change in my longer-run outlook.  Compared with the Greenbook, I see somewhat stronger growth in the second half of this year and somewhat weaker growth next year and in 2010.  Most of the difference from the Greenbook in 2009 and 2010 comes from the policy path assumptions.  I assume that policy accommodation is removed at a more rapid pace than does the Greenbook.  Recent economic data suggest that, although downside risks to growth remain, they have diminished.  I continue to judge that the potential spillover effects from the financial distress have understandably been overestimated in this Committee’s recent decisions and in Greenbook forecasts in recent months.  In my view, the greater risks to the outlook come from rising energy and commodity prices and less from the financial distress as we go forward.  In my view, current policy accommodation is greater than needed to address these risks. As I indicated at the last meeting, I believe that the upside risks to inflation have increased considerably over the past several months.  Like the Greenbook, I expect both overall and core PCE inflation to move higher in the second half of this year.  If this happens and we maintain the current level of the funds rate, I believe we are likely to see further erosion in inflation expectations, which will undermine our credibility with financial markets and the public.  In this event, I judge we will greatly increase the likelihood that we will need to raise rates more aggressively, taking rates above neutral, in order to achieve our longer-run inflation objectives; and that is of significant concern to me, Mr. Chairman. Turning to the issue of long-term projections, let me comment that I have felt somewhat constrained by the current three-year horizon for our quarterly projections.  Of the options presented by the subcommittee, I am most comfortable with providing estimates of the values for total inflation, output growth, and unemployment at which the economy is likely to converge.  I am not sure, however, how we want to label these estimates, if they are included in the table.  I understand that putting these estimates out might be interpreted as a move closer to inflation targeting, but I think that this is a bridge we are ready to cross since we adopted the enhanced projections process.  The other options seem less desirable.  Given the resources required, by my staff at least, I doubt that we could provide a meaningful forecast at a four-year or five-year horizon, and I am not sure how projections for average values over a period of five to ten years ahead would be interpreted by the public.  In my view, appropriate policy should be expected to return the economy to its long-run equilibrium over a three-to-five-year period, with the length of the period depending on the nature of the shock.  Setting out a five-to-ten-year horizon could be construed as a weakening in our commitment to achieve our mandate in a timely manner.  Thank you.

Passage number 70.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District economy continues to be sluggish.  Severe weather, combined with a very wet spring, is hampering agriculture in some areas.  Major flooding has caused significant damage already, and the situation continues to develop.  Many business contacts in the District emphasize energy costs along with some other high commodity prices as an overriding concern.  Most of the descriptions I have encountered concern businesses and consumers scrambling to adjust to new pricing realities.  Many contacts are reporting skittishness over the inflation outlook, fueled by dramatic increases in key commodity prices.  Many contacts with deep experience in the commodities markets remain convinced that market manipulation or speculation is behind the run-up in commodity prices across the board over the past several years.  This belief is widespread and deeply held.  Many predict a crash in market prices of these commodities once the bubble bursts.  My assessment is that this very strong belief may, by itself, have important macroeconomic implications.  Businesses and households may be reacting very differently to price increases that they see as temporary, as opposed to their reaction if they view price increases as permanent and unlikely to reverse. Reports on the level of economic activity are decidedly mixed.  The housing sector remains in a deep slump and subject to a widespread shakeup.  Business in the energy sector continues to boom.  High energy prices are affecting the logistics business, which has to try to be profitable at higher prices with reduced demand.  Still, a very large retailer reports brisk activity, and a large technology firm is essentially unaffected by the macroeconomic slowdown.  Recent data on the U.S. economy have been stronger than forecast, keeping economic performance weak but avoiding a particularly sharp contraction.  The worst outcomes stemming from financial market turmoil have failed to materialize thus far.  There is, to be sure, still some potential for additional upheaval, depending in part on the managerial agility among key financial firms.  However, the U.S. economy is now much better positioned to handle financial market turmoil than it was six months ago.  This is due to the lending facilities now in place and to the environment of low interest rates that has been created.  Renewed financial market turmoil, should it occur during the summer or fall, would not now be as worrisome from a systemic risk perspective.  In addition to this lessened risk from financial markets, I see the drag from housing dissipating during the second half of the year.  Most likely we will also see a moderation in energy price increases.  Output growth is, therefore, likely to be moderately stronger going forward. Policy was very aggressive during January and March of this year.  This was, in part, a preemptive action, insurance against a particularly severe downturn brought on by financial contagion.  This was a very real possibility, but it did not materialize.  This has created a situation with more stimulus in train than would have been intended had we known the outcome in advance.  This is putting upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations in the second half of this year.  Policy has to turn now to face this situation. On the long-term projections, I think it is a good idea to put down long-term projections.  I am happy with any of the options.  I have a slight preference for option 3.  I think a trial run would be good.  If the objective is to name these numbers, such as an inflation target or the potential growth of the economy, another way to do it would just be to name those numbers and not have it tied to any projection or any particular year.  We could just say, “This is what I think the inflation objectives should be.  This is how fast I think the economy could grow in the absence of shocks.  And this is what I think the unemployment rate would be if output were growing at potential and inflation were at target.”  You could just name those numbers.  You wouldn’t have to say five years away or ten years away, which kind of brings in new long-run factors that you might not want to get into.  Thank you.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 72.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The last two months have brought an interesting shift in my conversations with my business contacts.  Their concerns have shifted from problems in financial markets to the rapid increase in input prices.  Energy prices are the focus nationwide, but steel prices are also capturing the attention of the business people in my District.  Several manufacturers and builders noted that the price they pay for steel has almost doubled since the beginning of this year.  Clearly, businesses are worried about signs of growing price pressures, but their reactions to these price shocks tell a more complicated story.  Many manufacturers have not been able to pass on price increases, resulting in a clear loss to profit margins.  These businesses often report cost-containment or efficiency programs that will affect their hiring and capital decisions for months to come. Interestingly, the consumer price data show a similar dichotomy.  My staff noted that our primary measures of core inflation are not providing a consistent story about the path of underlying inflation.  In the May CPI report, roughly one-third of the weighted price changes increased at rates above 5 percent, and roughly one-third of prices changed by rates less than 1 percent.  For example, while energy costs were up strongly and prices for a number of general service components have been drifting higher, large declines in apparel and vehicle expenses are imparting significant offsets.  The 16 percent trimmed mean indicator showed an alarming 4 percent rise in prices, while the median rose just at 2.2 percent.  The weight of price changes in the 1 percent to 5 percent range was unusually small, making it difficult to estimate the central tendency of the price change distribution with much confidence.  So this makes it difficult to get a good read on where future prices are headed. My District business contacts remain pessimistic about growth prospects.  District retail reports focused extensively on the likely effects of gasoline and food prices on the purchasing decisions of consumers.  Many manufacturers, builders, and distributors are facing complicated output and investment decisions in the context of input price growth and weaker markets.  Overall, most of the business people that I talk with are still quite cautious about their business plans, despite the fact that most of them have found sources of credit and terms that are not too elevated from what they have seen in previous years. In the economic projections that I submitted for this meeting, I raised my near-term forecast for output growth slightly and for headline inflation slightly more.  Over the medium term, my outlook continues to be for modest growth because the housing market, in my forecast, recovers slowly, actually more slowly than in the Greenbook.  My staff estimated a model for national housing starts that takes into account what has happened in the past in states that have seen major increases in foreclosures.  The real estate difficulties that these states faced were much more persistent than anything that we have yet seen in the national data.  The bottom line of this analysis is that, if the patterns of past housing cycles from the states that experienced the boom–bust cycles are repeated at the national level, then housing starts should remain relatively weak over the next couple of years.  Supporting this analysis, three of the large regional banking organizations in my District are increasing their loan-loss provisions significantly in the second quarter based on the continued deterioration in the housing sector.  Based on current projections, these institutions are projecting housing sector credit losses to accelerate in the second half of 2008 and to continue into 2009.  Currently, the weak output growth contributes to my forecast of declining inflation rates, especially the core rate, but I also see evidence supporting that view in the “less worker bargaining power” scenario that is in the Greenbook.  My contacts see very little price pressures coming from labor costs now or in the near future.   Finally, implicit in my forecast for output growth and inflation is a fed funds rate path that includes increases later this year and into next year.  Although additional risks to growth remain, the primary risk to my forecast concerns input prices and inflation expectations.  If commodity prices continue to accelerate, they are going to put upward pressure on both headline and core inflation and downward pressure on output.  That environment could lead to a highly undesirable increase in inflation expectations.  On the positive side of risk to the outlook, I think that the fed funds rate actions that we have taken, in conjunction with the actions that we took in August to bolster market liquidity, have improved confidence, and I have substantially lowered the odds I had placed on financial market meltdown and on a severe recession.  In that sense, since our meeting in April the downside risks to my outlook for economic growth have lessened somewhat, and the risks to my inflation outlook have moved up somewhat. Regarding the issue of providing longer-term forecasts, I have long supported efforts to clarify the underlying objectives of FOMC participants by providing our longer-term economic projections.  Of the proposals that were offered by the Subcommittee on Communications, I favor reporting the average values for output growth, unemployment, and total inflation expected over a five-to-ten-year period—option 3.  The features of these five-to-ten-year projections that I find attractive are that they indicate where the economy might converge and don’t imply too much knowledge of the path to the long run.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents multiple points of contention or disagreement. First, there is disagreement among business contacts regarding the impact of rising input prices. Some have been able to pass on price increases, while others have experienced a loss to profit margins. Second, there is a discrepancy in the consumer price data, with some measures of core inflation showing significant price increases and others showing minimal changes. Third, there is a difference in outlook between the District business contacts, who remain pessimistic about growth prospects, and the speaker who has a slightly more positive near-term forecast for output growth and inflation. Finally, there is a potential disagreement regarding the risks to the outlook, with the speaker acknowledging the possibility of increasing inflation expectations due to accelerating commodity prices, while also highlighting the positive impact of recent Fed actions on confidence.

Passage number 75.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, like some others—maybe many others—I, too, have raised my forecast for growth for this year, basically just extending what’s happening in the first half of the year, and I’ve raised my projection for growth next year marginally as well.  Still, I must admit to some significant reservations about doing that.  As I look at the outlook and as Larry Slifman pointed out, there are a number of weaknesses, concerns, or downsides that you can pretty readily identify—tight or tightening credit conditions, a still significant decline in housing activity, a decline in housing values and the negative wealth effects associated with that, the run-up in energy prices, and so forth.  Many of those will adversely affect the consumer, it seems to me.  When we have that high a number of what I would call identifiable negatives, I wouldn’t be surprised if we had one or more quarters of significant economic contraction still ahead of us despite the recent relatively good news on the growth side. At the same time, the news on inflation hasn’t been particularly positive from my perspective, and that’s particularly true if the Greenbook is right and some of the relatively favorable recent readings on core inflation are likely to prove transitory.  I’m struck by the volume of questions I get and concerns expressed about inflation when I’m out talking with business groups or giving a speech to a more general audience.  Now, a lot of this, of course, is focused on or stems from what’s happening to energy prices and food prices, which are highly visible and which people experience directly and frequently.  Nevertheless, I’m concerned that all of that makes inflation expectations a bit more vulnerable, maybe more than a bit more vulnerable, than they have been to this point. My reading of inflation expectations per se is that they, at least the longer-term expectations—and I’m relying mostly on the TIPS data here—have been remarkably well anchored so far.  Perhaps a partial explanation for that is that core inflation really hasn’t moved much since 2003–04.  That’s a bit of a double-edged sword because it has locked in a bit higher than I might have preferred.  Nevertheless, stability that has been maintained is there.  Perhaps it goes some distance to explain our continuing, or what appears to be our continuing, credibility on that issue.  Now, the Greenbook does have some inching up of core inflation from here.  If they’re right and that’s all we get, then I would be surprised if that led to a real deterioration in inflation expectations.  But that may prove to be a big “if.” As far as extending the projections goes, I’m in favor of doing that.  I don’t think there will be a huge payoff, but I think it will provide some additional information to us internally and to the public.  I don’t have a strong preference about which alternative we go with.  Maybe the trial run will point out some advantages or disadvantages that we didn’t anticipate.  At the moment, if I had to vote, I’d probably vote for the second alternative, which would be to split the difference, put down the fifth year, and let it go at that.

Passage number 84.
 MR. LACKER.  Thanks, Brian, for including these two new lines of the real federal funds rate.  As I remarked yesterday, one use of the figures is to look back and judge the degree of accommodation relative to other historical episodes.  My understanding is that the Greenbook forecast of headline inflation four quarters ahead is higher now than it was in 2004, when the black line in your exhibit 3 last hit its lowest point.  My understanding is that, if you drew that black line using the equivalent of line 12, the Greenbook’s forecast for overall inflation, the trough in 2004 would lie around zero, and we would now be at minus 1.3.

Passage number 101.
 MR. KOHN.  President Evans, so you are arguing that the re-intermediation process is going to raise the NAIRU.  I thought that the NAIRU depended on the structure of the labor markets, job matching, and stuff like that, so I didn’t quite understand the connection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any signs of contention or disagreement. Mr. Kohn is simply stating that he didn't understand the connection between re-intermediation and the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) and seeking clarification from President Evans.


Passage number 102.
 MR. EVANS.  I’m alluding, without understanding or working out, to a sectoral-shifts model of unemployment and how that search process could be more difficult.  You’re just taking resources that over some period took a while to allocate to the financial sector and now they have to be reallocated somewhere else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans is explaining his understanding of a sectoral-shifts model of unemployment and how resources that were previously allocated to the financial sector now need to be reallocated elsewhere.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 104.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recognizing, as I do, where we’re coming from and its dangers, I think more-recent data suggest that the downside risks to growth have diminished, and in my judgment the current stance of policy is much more accommodative than necessary to address these risks.  I continue to believe that the two most recent policy actions of this Committee were more than sufficient, and we really need to think about reversing them sooner rather than later.  Inflation risks have risen, and we have seen erosion in longer-term inflation expectations.  As I noted in my previous remarks on the outlook, if we do not begin to remove policy accommodation soon, I think we risk having to tighten policy more aggressively in the future to reestablish our credibility. A couple of things.  It struck me in looking at some of the major economies besides the United States—the European Union, Japan, and China—if you look at the real interest rates, they’re low.  I mean, they are 1 percent or less or negative.  So this is a lot of stimulus coming into the world economy.  And to make my point again, I don’t think you can have a sustained recovery with a sustained inflationary environment, which we’re in danger of encountering if we continue on this path. Over the past several weeks, markets have significantly altered their expected funds rate path to remove policy accommodation, and therefore, I don’t know that doing something today would be that big a surprise.  The current funds rate path built into the market rates is closer to what I believe is desirable to maintain price stability over the long run, but I would prefer moving somewhat faster—3 percent by the end of this year and perhaps 4¼ percent by the end of ’09.  Thus, in my view, we should begin the process of removing monetary policy accommodation by increasing the fed funds rate target by 25 basis points at this meeting.  I think this action would perhaps be somewhat unexpected, and I recognize that there is some risk that markets would react by moving the funds rate path up more dramatically than some might desire.  However, taking this action would move us beyond merely talking about inflationary risk and would help us contain inflation expectations by reaffirming our commitment to maintaining price stability.  I think it would quickly have a positive effect on the economy as these expectations begin to shift.  Now, assuming that’s not the majority view today, I would then encourage us to set the stage in our language for stronger actions coming in the future.  That is an important issue especially, as you mentioned yesterday, in terms of remarks that we might make following this meeting, in speeches and so forth. Finally, let me just say that I think policy is currently accommodative, perhaps very accommodative.  The insurance policy taken out earlier this year to guard against the tail risk of spillovers of the financial distress to activity is less necessary, perhaps far less necessary, and it is potentially even harmful to the efforts of maintaining price stability.  Therefore, I encourage action sooner rather than later.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their own judgment and perspective on the current stance of policy and the need for action.


Passage number 105.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you" and the mention of President Lacker do not indicate any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 106.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The growth outlook has improved over the last two months, but the inflation picture has not.  If anything, it has deteriorated.  I think it’s clear, as President Hoenig argued, that we should be tightening policy soon.  The extent to which we brought the funds rate down was predicated on downside risks and the notion that we could reverse course rapidly.  As downside risks now look much less likely, I just don’t see how an argument that 2 percent was the appropriate funds rate in April does not also imply that a higher funds rate would be appropriate now.  Taking back some of that stimulus at this meeting, however, is probably inconsistent with the commitment implied by the Committee’s traditional interest rate smoothing behavior.  So I’m willing to stand pat today with the funds rate. The timing of such moves is going to present us with some trouble going forward, though.  Even if we avoid outright recession, as now seems probable, the unemployment rate is likely to keep rising for a time.  But waiting isn’t going to make it easier for us, in any event, because there’s a likelihood of the fourth quarter’s showing a slowdown when the stimulus wears off.  But inflation is going to increase in the near term as well.  At least that seems likely, and holding rates down while that happens and while inflation expectations are already fairly elevated seems awfully risky to me. I can understand the need for some conviction when we raise rates.  When we began cutting rates aggressively in January, there were some significant uncertainties in the inflation outlook, though.  I hope we don’t set any higher a threshold of conviction for rate increases than we set for rate cuts.  Looking back at 2003-04, and this is strictly in hindsight, one can argue that we erred by waiting too long to reverse course, and I’ve heard you yourself make that argument, Mr. Chairman.  So the logic of risk management works in both directions.  I think we need to keep that in mind.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage contains disagreement or contention. This can be seen in the statement, "I hope we don’t set any higher a threshold of conviction for rate increases than we set for rate cuts." This suggests that there is a difference of opinion on the appropriate level of conviction needed for raising interest rates.


Passage number 107.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude and states a title for someone (President Yellen).


Passage number 108.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B with the proposed wording.  Given the forecast and the risks around it, our next move on the funds rate is likely to be up, and the question is when.  Assuming that the data on growth and inflation come in roughly as I and the Greenbook expect, I would envision beginning to remove policy accommodation toward the end of this year, similar to the assumption in the Greenbook.  As I mentioned, I’m not very confident that the outlook for growth and employment has improved as much as the Greenbook assumes.  I’m concerned that households and firms are in a python squeeze of an intensifying credit crunch and a continuing decline in housing wealth as well as pressures from surging food and energy prices.  I think the economy has shown resilience so far, and that’s reassuring, but I don’t think it’s assured for the future.  The aggressive policy actions that we have put in place since January are actually working to cushion the blow, and that’s part of the reason that we haven’t seen a greater unraveling so far. I mentioned yesterday that, with respect to inflation, the behavior of both core inflation and wages thus far makes me optimistic that headline inflation will come down if commodity prices finally level off.  But I think there’s no doubt that the risks with respect to inflation are not symmetrical at this point, and they have definitely increased.  I still see inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored, but there’s no doubt that a wage–price spiral could develop, and dealing with it would be a very difficult and very painful problem for the Committee.  So while I feel that we are essentially credible now, I wouldn’t want to take absolutely for granted that this is something that we can count on going forward. At this point, the federal funds rate remains well below the recommendations of most versions of the Taylor rule.  I have viewed this as appropriate, not largely as insurance against downside risk but simply in refection of the unusually severe pressures from collapsing wealth and tight credit and financial constraints.  But it does seem to me to be appropriate going forward to at least take out some insurance against the development of a wage–price spiral mentality, and that could take the form of gradually removing that discrepancy from what, for example, a Taylor rule recommends.  But before we begin to do that, it does seem to me that we should wait to get a somewhat clearer picture of where the real side is going.

Passage number 109.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Thank you. President Plosser" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude towards President Plosser without any opposing views or conflict.


Passage number 110.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards Governor Kohn. There is no evident disagreement or opposing viewpoints presented.


Passage number 111.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the action and language of alternative B; Brian’s striking of “near-term” is fine with me.  This is a tough situation, as we all remarked yesterday.  Commodity prices are at the center of the problem that we find ourselves in.  In my view, we didn’t cause the rise in commodity prices.  We may have contributed a little around the edges, but whatever we contributed was a necessary byproduct of what we needed to do to cope with what was happening to the U.S. economy, and we can’t reverse the rise in relative prices without tremendous cost to the U.S. economy.  Or even the rise in headline inflation, we couldn’t undo that without putting a huge amount of slack in the economy to force down wages, sticky prices, et cetera, and that would not be appropriate.   I think the classic response that we’ve all been talking about is to take a temporary increase in inflation and in unemployment that facilitates the relative price changes that need to happen, concentrate on second-round effects, and make sure those increases are temporary.  I think that’s inadvertently what we’ve fallen into here.  Given the housing and financial shocks, the 2 percent fed funds rate of alternative B is consistent for now with continuing along the path of the temporary increases in inflation and unemployment.  Unlike many of you, I don’t see the current rate as extraordinarily accommodative, given what else has happened in financial markets.  There is no insurance in the staff forecast, right.  The Greenbook forecast has zero insurance in it.  My own forecast was a little stronger than the Greenbook’s.  I think all of ours were a little stronger than the Greenbook’s, but even if I marked up r* by ½ point or 1 point, that’s not a huge amount of insurance in the circumstances that we’re facing.  I note that no one sitting around this table predicted a decline in the unemployment rate over the balance of the year; so everybody has 5½ percent or higher unemployment rates predicted by the end of the year.  The staff thinks that the current 5½ percent is a little too high.  So they are expecting the unemployment rate to come down in the next month or two.  Given this, we’re all expecting the unemployment rate to rise over the balance of the year.  I would think, given the lags in policy, that if you thought policy was hugely accommodative, you’d see some decline in the unemployment rate over the next six, seven, or eight months.  I think our own forecasts suggest that some insurance might be here, but not the amount that I’m hearing some of you talk about.  I don’t see the consistency there. My own view is that there’s probably a little insurance in it, and it’s appropriate for now.  I agree that the next move in interest rates is more likely to be up than down.  I assumed, like President Yellen, that it would be at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year.  The rising unemployment that we all expect should help damp inflation and inflation expectations and make it very hard to pass through all these cost increases that we’re hearing from businesses that they want to pass through and certainly make it hard for wages and cost pressures to rise. So I agree with everyone else that the weight in the two tails has shifted.  There’s less weight in the downside risk tail for output and more weight in the upside risk tail for inflation.  The statement does a very nice job of saying that explicitly, and I think that we just need to await incoming data and information about inflation expectations, costs, and whatnot to see when the appropriate time to move will be.  Because I don’t think there’s a tremendous amount of insurance in there, I think we can afford to be a little patient and data dependent here.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kohn, expresses his support for alternative B and agrees with the language used. He also agrees with the view that the next move in interest rates is more likely to be up than down.


Passage number 112.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto.  Oh sorry, President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 113.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Governor Kohn, a question, or a comment, about interest rates.  A lot of our discussion has been centered on how accommodative we think policy is and how we interpret it in the current environment.  If I want to quantify the magnitude a bit, at least the way I think about it, even if I believe that the economy is weak enough so that the appropriate equilibrium real rate of interest is zero, we have inflation running somewhere north of 3 percent.  That would suggest a nominal funds rate of about 3 percent as opposed to 2 percent.  So roughly speaking, I would interpret that to say that we have roughly 100 basis points of extra accommodation built into our fed funds rate relative to what—and that’s assuming an equilibrium real rate of zero, which might even be low.  So if I’m thinking about it that way, could you clarify how we should quantify it in some way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification on how to quantify the extent of accommodation in interest rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 114.
 MR. KOHN.  It’s very difficult.  We don’t know what inflation expectations are.  We’re all using proxies, as came forth very strongly at the Cape Cod conference where we both were, President Plosser.  We don’t even understand very well how expectations are formed, and I think what we’re looking for is how people perceive the cost of capital to finance purchases.  So we’re wondering whether this low interest rate is causing them to bring purchases forward from the future to the present to induce them to buy things, capital goods, right.  That’s the interest rate we’re really looking at—the perceived cost of credit to folks—and I’m not sure that subtracting any rate of inflation is the way to get that.  Obviously, the cost of credit for housing is perceived as hugely high right now.  The cost of credit for automobiles is perceived as hugely high for reasons that perhaps aren’t related to monetary policy.  I don’t think we see a surge in purchases of capital equipment that would suggest that businesses perceive the cost of credit to be very negative.  So I think, because we don’t understand inflation expectations and can’t measure them, you have to look for a lot of different things around the edges to confirm what people perceive the real rate to be.  I just don’t see a lot of information that suggests that people perceive the real rate to be very negative and that it is influencing how they manage their purchases of goods and services over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. This is evident when Mr. Kohn states that he does not believe that people perceive the real interest rate to be very negative and that it is influencing their purchases. This disagreement is based on the lack of understanding and measurement of inflation expectations.


Passage number 115.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I guess just to say it more simply, all the rates that have determined behavior—for example, mortgage rates, auto rates, or corporate bond rates—are higher than a year ago.  Now, unless there has been a major change in long-term inflation expectations, which the TIPS data don’t suggest, there don’t seem to be indications, as far as interest rates that are relevant to people’s spending decisions, that there has been a significant reduction.  Someone else had a comment.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of observation and analysis regarding interest rates and their potential impact on people's spending decisions. Governor Kroszner's comment is not specified, so it cannot be determined if there is any contention in it.


Passage number 116.
 MR. KROSZNER.  It’s directly on this point.  It seems that in the situation we’re in, with very elevated spreads in LIBOR, there are almost no contracts in the real markets that are related directly to fed funds.  It’s usually through three-month LIBOR, and we know that the spread is now roughly 70 or 75 basis points higher than it used to be.  It used to be about 10 basis points, and now it’s around 80.  For me that’s one rough proxy in how I think about this—that the way in which our actions are being translated into market prices is somewhat different from the way it was when the spreads were lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the current situation and expressing their thoughts on how this situation may differ from the past.


Passage number 117.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker will back President Plosser up though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement suggests that President Lacker supports President Plosser or agrees with him.


Passage number 118.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  This is like pro wrestling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a statement that compares something to pro wrestling, suggesting that there may be similarities or parallels between the two. It does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 119.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  Just a brief observation.  Spreads always rise in recessions.  We always lower real rates in recessions.  So to say that the fact that spreads have risen by itself doesn’t make this an exceptional circumstance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a statement of observation regarding the behavior of spreads and real rates in recessions.


Passage number 120.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The magnitude is somewhat greater, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It simply states that the magnitude is somewhat greater.


Passage number 121.
 MR. LACKER.  For some; not for others.  Corporate bond spreads aren’t as high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that corporate bond spreads aren't as high for some individuals, implying that there may be differing opinions or perspectives on the matter.


Passage number 122.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto, we apologize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is offering an apology to President Pianalto.


Passage number 123.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I apologize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 124.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support keeping the fed funds rate target at its current level and the language in alternative B.  I see some hopeful signs that stress in financial markets has diminished as has the threat of a sharp recession.  Despite these recent signs, I expect that the growth momentum in the economy will build only slowly.  Moreover, I continue to worry that the residential real estate market could deteriorate even more than I had put in my baseline projection.  Nevertheless, I am somewhat more comfortable with the prospects for economic activity than I was in April.   At the same time, I can’t easily dismiss the recent behavior of energy and some other commodity prices.  I found the Bluebook’s supplemental analysis on oil prices, inflation expectations, and monetary policy to be very useful in thinking about the dilemma that we face.  The fact that oil prices have risen so sharply and have been so persistent highlights the risks surrounding the downward projection that I have for core inflation.  Without some evidence of less inflationary pressure I don’t believe that the fed funds rate can be kept at its current level for very long.  But while I do believe that the next policy action will be a rate hike, the potential for the recovery to sputter makes me cautious about embarking on an upward trajectory for the fed funds rate just yet.  I believe that the language in alternative B conveys the right sense of direction for the fed funds rate path, with the right amount of caution.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses their support for keeping the fed funds rate target at its current level and agrees with the language in alternative B. They also discuss their concerns and cautiousness about the state of the economy and inflation, but there is no disagreement present.


Passage number 125.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage. The statement is a straightforward expression of gratitude.


Passage number 126.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  U.S. economic data have been stronger than expected during the intermeeting period.  The earlier, very aggressive moves in January and March taken by the FOMC were viewed in part as insurance against the possibility of a very serious downturn brought on by financial market turmoil.  That very serious downturn has not materialized.  Tail risk has diminished significantly.  This means that this Committee has put too much economic stimulus on the table and must think about ways to remove it going forward.  Failure to do so will create a significant inflation problem on top of problems in housing and financial markets.  Slack might be helpful, as mentioned by Governor Kohn, but those effects are small compared with expectations effects.  I think it is too early to tighten at this meeting.  Therefore, I am supporting alternative B with the language proposed by President Plosser.  But the Committee has to think carefully about how and when to embark on a path for interest rates that will set us up to achieve price stability in a reasonable time frame.  My sense is that this will require more-aggressive tightening of policy than currently envisioned in staff simulations. Financial market problems have been described here as a slow burn, and I think that may well be an apt description.  Many firms in this sector took on too much risk and, in retrospect, had poor business models.  I expect that this will take a long time to unwind.  Despite this, the systemic risk component of the situation has diminished considerably.  Systemic risk is in part a function of the degree of surprise in the failure of a financial institution that was perceived to be in good health.  Surely by now few market participants would be surprised to encounter the failure of certain institutions.  Failures, should they occur, can be handled in an orderly way.  Certain investors would lose out in such an event, to be sure, but my sense is that the panic element that would be associated with systemic risk would not be present.  I believe that we should start to downweight systemic risk concerns substantially going forward because it is no longer credible to say that market participants are surprised to learn of problems at certain financial institutions.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Bullard discussing the current state of the U.S. economy and his views on monetary policy.


Passage number 127.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply expressing gratitude to President Stern without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 128.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, first of all, I believe that policy is well positioned for now from a couple of perspectives.  For the next quarter or two, I think there is still some potential for significant disappointment in terms of economic growth—but only for a quarter or two.  Beyond that, a pickup in real activity appears pretty likely.  That is, based on what I know now, further reductions in the federal funds rate shouldn’t be required for the economy to improve next year and beyond, and we do have the liquidity facilities available should strains in financial markets threaten to intensify.  Policy is also well positioned for now from a second perspective—namely, that the fed funds futures curves have priced in an increase in the funds rate beginning in the late summer or the fall.  I think that this is appropriate because I think we are going to find that we will want to and have to start moving to contain inflation expectations.  Precisely when to move may turn out to be a difficult call, but I would like to see futures priced to anticipate such action on our part—as indeed they are at the moment.   That brings me to the recommendation and the language.  I think the strategy expressed in the Bluebook associated with alternative B is fine for now, and so I favor alternative B.  The language in alternative B is okay as well, although I would endorse President Plosser’s recommendation to drop “considerable” from the description of financial strains.  The other thing I would point out is that the Bluebook says that, at least in the staff’s judgment, the language associated with B might push back expectations for the onset of policy tightening.  I am reading from page 33.  It is not that I am anxious to tighten necessarily as early as possible, but I would rather not push those expectations back at this point.  So if that assessment is correct, it might be advisable to find a way to address that issue.  I don’t feel all that strongly about it, but I think we could, if we wanted, take the sentence in paragraph 4 that’s in red, drop three words—the first word “although,” a word at the end of the phrase “remain,” and then “they.”  So you would just say, “Downside risks to growth appear to have diminished somewhat,” which I think is true.  It doesn’t suggest that we are sanguine about growth, although I suppose it could be read that way.  But I am a little concerned about the way we might change expectations based on the Bluebook commentary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses their opinion and provides their reasoning, but they do not disagree or argue with anyone else.


Passage number 129.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You have your Strunk and White style manual with you, I can see.  [Laughter]  Thank you, President Stern.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a comment about the presence of a style manual and expresses gratitude to President Stern.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 130.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I support alternative B.  At this time, there are significant downside risks to the economy and financial markets, as the collateral damage from the housing problems works through the economy and financial institutions.  At the same time, continued increases in oil and food prices raise the risk that some part of these supply shocks will be incorporated into inflation expectations.  In the absence of more-compelling evidence about which of these two risks will dominate, I would favor remaining on hold at this meeting.  I hope that the economy picks up in the second half of this year and that the financial markets stabilize so policy can become less accommodative, but it is not clear that this will be the outcome.  While the inflation outlook has been affected by continued energy shocks, the future path of oil prices remains uncertain, and recent history has many instances in which oil shocks are short-lived and have little effect on longer-run inflation expectations.  Until we have more clarity on the path of the economy and inflation, policy should remain on hold, and our language should be consistent with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The passage presents two different risks: the downside risks to the economy and financial markets and the risk of inflation from increases in oil and food prices. The speaker states that in the absence of more compelling evidence about which risk will dominate, they would favor remaining on hold. This suggests that there is a disagreement or contention about the appropriate course of action.


Passage number 131.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named President Lockhart.


Passage number 132.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also prefer the fed funds rate recommendation and language of alternative B.  It captures the delicacy—I think that word was used yesterday—of the current tradeoffs and leans fairly heavily rhetorically against inflation and inflation expectations.  I note that inflation and inflation expectations are mentioned in both paragraphs 3 and 4 using the language, “Uncertainty . . . remains high” and “risks . . . have increased.”  I think this constitutes considerable stress on the seriousness of our commitment to address inflation and expectations, and it is a complete statement and will serve to condition the market.  As Brian said, it suggests that firming later in the year could occur, and I believe that is appropriate.  I would like to give the medicine that we have applied to resolve the situation and the financial markets a little more time to work.  I am in accord with Governor Kohn’s thinking of stimulus or accommodation in terms of the cost of borrowing to real borrowers—individuals and businesses—and, therefore, we really have not seen a proportionate improvement in the cost of capital, notwithstanding such a strong reduction in the fed funds rate. So as of now, I would expect to support a reversal a little later in the year.  I also think there is enough ambiguity currently that giving the situation a little more time to clarify would be helpful.  Core inflation has not risen dramatically, whereas headline has, and it is headline that the public is reacting to.  Measures of expectations, such as they are, seem to suggest that short-term expectations have risen more than long-term, so there really hasn’t been a clear breakout of long term.  It may be true that it would be too late if we saw that breakout, but I think we can afford to wait for a greater preponderance of evidence to accumulate over the next few weeks before considering a reversal.  So I support, as I said, alternative B and the language of alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their preference for alternative B and explaining their reasoning for supporting it.


Passage number 133.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "Thank you" and the mention of President Fisher do not contain any opposing or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 134.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a polite expression of gratitude and a simple statement addressing someone by their title and last name. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 135.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say just a few things.  First, to state the obvious—there are risks on all sides of these decisions.  Second, I will try to wade into the debate briefly on this accommodation point.  My own view is that policy is accommodative—the degree of that is why we are having this debate.  I think about our degree of accommodation as a function both of our target fed funds rate and what the financial markets do with it, by which I don’t mean just what the expected fed funds targets are out in the future but the transmission mechanism.  The degree of accommodation, as we think about our decision now and in the next several months, will depend more on financial market developments than, frankly, the decisions that we end up making on the target; and it is very hard for us to judge the direction of these markets.  As much as we have talked about tail risks on the financial market side and the real economy side being diminished, I think all of us would say that there is a real chance that this will be a long, hot summer.  It is hard to know what the credit channels are going to do with our target federal funds rate.  It is not obvious to me that we should try to perfectly offset the changes in financial market developments by contemplating changes in the federal funds rate now. What I think most likely is that we won’t be as certain as we would like to be regarding growth risks and we won’t be as certain as we would like to be regarding financial market developments before we have to begin a posture of removing policy accommodation.  So with all those caveats and a view that policy remains more accommodative than we can allow it to be for too long, I will support alternative B and think that we have to remain very open-minded, very nimble, in our task of removing policy accommodation. In terms of President Plosser’s suggestion on “considerable,” I think the reason for the debate over using that word is in my own view that these markets are still under considerable stress, but the trend from the last statement to this statement is that they are under less considerable stress.  Therein lies the difficulty in wording this in the statement.  If we do remove “considerable,” it wouldn’t surprise me that when we next meet we will say, “Boy, it seems as though stress is up.  Wonder if we should put it back in.”  I don’t feel strongly, other than I don’t like the idea of removing it now if we think that there’s a chance that the trends, which are very tenuous, turn around.  So I think I would favor the language that you have written.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit disagreements or arguments. It is a personal statement expressing the author's views and preferences.


Passage number 136.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a statement of gratitude and the mention of Governor Kroszner, but there is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 137.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  Obviously, as we have all discussed, we are facing enormous challenges from the continuing strength in prices and price changes in energy and raw materials.  Now, some of those are relative price changes that we don’t have the tools to address directly.  Recently, we have seen wheat come down as Australia has been able to replant, and it seems that things are going to come back.  Corn has gone up, as we heard from a number of people around the table, because of the challenges there.  We don’t have the tools to address that directly, but obviously, when so many of these commodity prices and energy prices are going up, that leads to concerns about where both headline inflation and core inflation are going.  So we definitely do have to be very mindful of that. I think the type of approach that we are taking in alternative B is a reasonable one.  Given the challenges that we are facing right now with the fragility in the financial markets—the continuing smoldering of those embers, with still chances that they could reignite and cause us a great deal of difficulty—it seems sensible to me to be roughly where we are now in terms of policy but to be signaling that we understand that challenges are coming from various sources that could lead to inflation pressures and that we need to be ready to offset those. In terms of how accommodative monetary policy is, I think actually it would be worthwhile—and maybe at the end of this I might pose a question to Brian—to look at LIBOR–OIS spreads and how much they typically go up during recessionary periods.  I know that other risk spreads typically go up, but my understanding is that those typically don’t go up as much.  Since so many contracts are based off the one-month and three-month LIBOR, that 75 basis points suggests that at least now we might want to take that into account in thinking about where monetary policy stands relative to other times when we would have had a funds rate at roughly this level. In terms of the language, I share Governor Warsh’s view on the use or lack of use of the word “considerable.”  I think President Stern’s suggestion—this is always a very dangerous and difficult game—would actually push the markets further than they are because I agree that broadly the path that they are seeing in the future is a reasonable one for them to see.  This language would roughly keep it there.  Taking out the acknowledgement of downside risks to growth remaining would make me concerned because (1) I certainly see those as still being there and (2) I think that would push the markets further to think that this is a signal that next time we are going to do it, and I don’t think we are quite there yet.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing challenges and potential inflation pressures but agrees with the approach being taken. They also share their view on the language being used.


Passage number 138.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is a simple expression of gratitude and an acknowledgment of Governor Mishkin. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 139.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I do support alternative B and the current language in the statement.  I have no problem with that.  I think it conveys what we need to convey.  Although I think that the next move is very likely to be up and it maybe should be done quite soon, I would argue that we still need to have a lot of flexibility and to think in terms of having a lot of flexibility in where we may have to head in the future.  I want to argue along those lines and outline why I think that is the case. The first issue is something that the Chairman mentioned yesterday, about which I felt very strongly—in fact, I meant to say it, but as always the Chairman says things better than I could in this context—that there really is still a very serious possibility that the shoe could drop in the financial markets.  The Chairman mentioned a set of institutions that we have to be concerned about, and although there has been some improvement in terms of the stress that the financial markets are under, I don’t think we are out of the woods yet.  We are likely to be, but we have to be ready to recognize that things could go south.  So that’s one issue.  The second issue is that the recent positive data we have seen are, again, very tenuous to me.  I’m hoping that they indicate that things are going in the right direction.  But a bunch of things make me very nervous, which I mentioned yesterday—how consumers react in housing crises, consumer sentiment, and the big problem that is going to occur when people have to face very high prices of food and energy, which hit their pocketbook very directly.  So, again, that could be quite contractionary.  The good news that we have seen recently might reverse very quickly.  The third issue is that I think the headwinds could be very substantial in the future, that this cleanup will take a long time, and in that case we could have very slow and subpar growth that could widen output gaps more than the Greenbook and most participants here are expecting.  So I do not consider the current stance of monetary policy to be overly stimulative.  For me it is just about right and very much along the lines of what I think would be optimal policy.  Of course, my view relates not only to the real economy.  I also think that inflation expectations, as far as I can tell so far, are reasonably well contained.  There is very little movement in the measures of inflation expectations that I pay most attention to.  That argues that our stance is about right.  I would also very strongly argue that I do not think that we have taken out a lot of insurance.  I have argued that before.  We have moved less gradually, which I think is very beneficial, and I would commend the Committee in that regard.  But we moved in line with what the forecasts have been telling us optimal policy would be, and I think that is quite important. However, here is why I think we need to have flexibility in the other direction.  If you think about a risk-management approach, it should not be focused just on tail risk to economic growth, which has been our most major concern because of the financial disruption.  It equally implies that, symmetrically, we should be just as worried about tail risk to inflation, particularly to long-run inflation expectations, which I think are the key driver of underlying inflation, which is what monetary policy can particularly deal with.  Here we have a situation in which we have hit the perfect storm of shocks because of the huge supply shock and there are much more serious upside risks and tail risks in terms of long-run inflation expectations.  So I really do worry that with long-run inflation expectations and, therefore, underlying inflation we are in a more fragile situation and that we have to be very cognizant of that in terms of what we do in the future. The bottom line is that we may have to move very quickly to raise rates if any of several things happens.  One is that headwinds are not as serious as I think they are likely to be.  There is certainly a very serious possibility that things could be better than I expect.  I would not be unhappy, so I would not get depressed, about that.  Really more depressing would be if inflation expectations started to look as though they were getting more unanchored.  Particularly, I would worry much more about what happens in terms of inflation compensation and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, paying some attention to consumer surveys but putting a lot less weight on them.  If the canary starts to look as though it is keeling over, we have to move very quickly, and so I am going to watch that canary very, very carefully.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker supports alternative B and the current language in the statement, but also expresses concerns about the possibility of a financial market downturn, the tenuousness of recent positive data, and the potential for slow and subpar growth. They argue that the current stance of monetary policy is not overly stimulative but also emphasize the need for flexibility and the possibility of needing to raise rates quickly if inflation expectations become unanchored.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 140.
 MR. FISHER.  Before the python gets it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is potential contention or disagreement about what will happen before the python gets something. However, without further context it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the contention.


Passage number 141.
 [Laughter] MR. MISHKIN.  Before the python gets it.  I think another consideration is very important.  I have to commend you on the Bluebook this time—it just had some great boxes.  [Laughter]  It would be nicer if they had a little color to them.  As a textbook author, I think they could have been a little ritzier and have had a little color, but they were great boxes.  In particular, a very important box was the one on the optimal reaction to oil price shocks.  One thing that comes out very strongly from that box is that if your credibility is weak on commitment to price stability and containing inflation expectations, you would have to tighten more to restore that credibility and get to a policy that would produce better outcomes.  So here is an issue that, with these supply shocks potentially causing a problem for long-run inflation expectations, we actually may have to react more quickly and more aggressively than we otherwise would.  This is an issue that I have been concerned about in terms of communication strategy—about how we better anchor long-run inflation expectations. So my bottom line is that I support alternative B.  I would like to keep the language the way it is currently, which I think works quite well.  But I do think that, going forward, we should not lock ourselves into what our policy is going to be, in either direction.  We need to preserve flexibility because we could be very surprised, although I think that the signal we have made that we are more concerned about inflation risks is absolutely appropriate.  We have to make clear that we will do whatever it takes, including raising interest rates when unemployment is rising, if we feel that long-run inflation expectations and inflation are not remaining under control.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion.


Passage number 142.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 143.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just want to say at the beginning that I think the way you framed your remarks yesterday had perfect pitch and balance, and it is really important that we not get ahead of ourselves in taking too much comfort from the fact that the first half was not as bad as we thought and think that the risks on the growth front are definitively behind us.  The improvement in financial markets that many of you spoke of is not as significant as we think or hope; we have had a lot of false dawns over this period.  A lot of what you see as improvement is the simple result of the existence of our facilities in the implied sense that people infer from our actions that we are going to protect people from a level of distress that we probably have no desire, will, or ability to actually do.  It is sort of like waking up in the hospital and having them say, “You are not dead yet, but we are not sure you’re going to live.”  It is not as good an improvement, and there has been a material erosion over the past four weeks.  It is very unlikely that you will have a substantial improvement in overall confidence in markets, a durable improvement in market functioning, and a substantial reduction in those spreads until there is more clarity about the likely path of the economy going forward, house prices in particular, and therefore the cash flows associated with the huge amount of credit that was extended over the past five years.   Again, it is going to be very hard for us to have a better feel for the balance of risks on growth front and the financial sector until we think we see signs ahead of some significant deceleration in the rate of decline of housing prices, if not some actual bottom.  On the basis of everything we know, that is still several quarters ahead.  Maybe it is going to surprise us on the upside and maybe we are going to see a big improvement in housing demand, but I think that the sense of a bottom looks to be several quarters ahead of us still. I would say that the risks are still acute.  Sure, the markets are a little more confident that we are going to successfully avoid a systemic financial crisis, but I wouldn’t take too much comfort from that.  I think it is also plausible that oil will be at $150 or $200 over the next six months or so.  There is some material probability that the set of challenges on that front is going to get worse.  So all that is just in favor of a fair amount of care and caution now, given the scale of the uncertainty out there and how fat the tail risks are on both sides of our mandate going forward. I like, and fully support, the language in alternative B.  I would not—as you might sense from my comments—take out the word “considerable” from the characterization of stress.  I am pretty comfortable with the framework laid out here, and, more important, Mr. Chairman, with the broad balance and strategy that you outlined yesterday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker begins by praising the chairman's remarks and agrees with the overall balance and strategy outlined. The speaker also expresses caution and acknowledges the uncertainties and risks involved in the current situation.


Passage number 144.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  In April, we signaled that, following our aggressive rate actions and our other efforts to support financial markets, it was going to be a time to pause and to assess the effects of our actions.  That was not that long ago, and I think it is appropriate to continue our watchful waiting for just a bit longer. I talked yesterday about the balance of tail risks as opposed to the balance of risks.  I think that, although the tail risks on the growth and financial side have moderated somewhat, they are still quite substantial.  I agree with the Vice Chairman on that point.  They arise from two separate but related sources.  The first is that, notwithstanding the stronger-than-expected performance in the second quarter, I think there is an excellent chance that we will still see a recessionary dynamic with the associated strong movements in employment and production.  Second—again as the Vice Chairman mentioned—I do not agree that systemic risk has gone away.  I think it is in abeyance.  There is perhaps, if anything, excessive confidence in the ability of the Fed to prevent a crisis situation from metastasizing.  Even if we don’t have a failure of a major firm, we still have the possibility of a significant adverse feedback loop as credit conditions worsen and banks come under additional pressure.  So if I could try to think about this—I don’t want to say “mathematically”—a lot of our discussion has implicitly suggested that there has been a linear model, which is that we are just trying to balance on the scales this risk against that risk.  Again, if you are worried about preventing bad outcomes, you have to worry more about nonlinear or discontinuous changes.  I think that, at this point, we still have significant risk of a nonlinear, discontinuous change in the financial markets or in the real economy. Tail risks have risen for inflation.  There is no question about it.  I take what has been said around the table extremely seriously, and I am quite anxious about it, I have to concede.  If I were making a comparison of tail risks to tail risks, I still think that the inflation tail risks have not yet reached the level of the concerns I have about the financial crisis.  In particular, some important indicators—such as wages, inflation expectations, and core inflation—have not yet signaled a major shift.  That being said, I do think we need to acknowledge the relative change in those risks, and we need to begin to prepare the market for the normalization that is going to have to come. Both President Fisher and President Stern talked about the rhetorical aspects of our policy and the effects on policy expectations, and I think we are all in agreement that words mean nothing unless they are eventually backed up by actions.  On the other hand, actions may be better if they are preceded by words, if you will.  We do need to begin to prepare the markets and to communicate clearly so that people will know what’s coming and that the system will be better able to deal with that. If I thought for sure that we were going to begin renormalizing very soon, I would propose doing it today.  Why wait.  But I think enough uncertainty and enough risks are on both sides that there is some benefit from waiting just a bit longer to see, first, how the financial markets evolve and, second, whether we continue this stronger-than-expected growth pattern or whether we begin to see a more recessionary-type of pattern.  In particular, between now and the next meeting, we have two employment reports, a lot of other relevant information, and a lot of insight from the financial markets.  At the same time, on the inflation side, we will see how commodity prices evolve, whether we have any kind of relief from what we saw in the last intermeeting period, how the dollar behaves, and how inflation expectations behave.  All those things will give us a better sense of where we are and how we should proceed. So I think we should try to be nimble.  We should try to respond to the information as it comes in.  We should be focused particularly on tail risks.  I think we should begin to move, or should maintain, market expectations toward tightening.  President Fisher, I think I have to note for the record that I don’t think we should let political considerations affect our decisions in any way, and I am not concerned about that.  I think we are all prepared to do what is necessary.  I don’t know what we are going to do in the next meeting or the meeting after that.  But my expectation now is that, as others have mentioned, we will begin normalizing interest rates relatively soon, and we should, if possible, begin to prepare the markets for that. For today, as I have indicated, I recommend no change in the federal funds rate target and alternative B for the statement.  I think alternative B captures the facts pretty well on the whole.  I won’t go into it, but I think the inflation paragraph is a little more hawkish.  It drops the discussion of a leveling-out of commodity prices.  It doesn’t refer to core inflation, which we have taken before as sort of a reassuring element.  I’m disappointed that President Fisher is going to vote against his own language in alternative B, paragraph 4, which we have adopted and which I think is a very good expression of the risks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the Vice Chairman and acknowledges the need to be prepared for potential risks in the financial markets and the economy. They also discuss the importance of clear communication and preparing the markets for future actions. There is a suggestion to wait and gather more information before making any changes, but overall there is no disagreement among the speakers.


Passage number 145.
  MR. FISHER.  I appreciate the adoption of the language.  I think it is much better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses appreciation for the adoption of the language and believes that it is much better.


Passage number 146.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think President Stern’s suggestion is interesting.  I am a little worried that it might go just a bit too far in suggesting that we have discounted the downside risks.  I am struggling with the “considerable” in alternative B, paragraph 2.  I have sort of heard two for and two against.  I don’t know if others have a view.  It is a bit risky to change, given how quickly things can move.  But if others would like to express a view, I think yet a third thing that we could do would be to say, “Financial markets, though somewhat improved recently, remain under considerable stress.”  That might be a way to address it.  Does anyone have any thoughts on that word.  Any concerns.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is expressing the author's thoughts and questions, without any indication of contention or disagreement with others.


Passage number 147.
 MR. LACKER.  I thought Vice Chairman Geithner’s characterization of markets was pretty good, but it is compatible with your suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not display any form of contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing agreement with Vice Chairman Geithner's characterization of markets.


Passage number 148.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only states the position/title of "Vice Chairman" without providing any additional information or context that would suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 149.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  If we look back and try to recalibrate at each meeting whether things are getting better or things are getting worse, we would regret each zig and each zag.  So I would just say that we have a suite of facilities in place.  They are in place today.  They are exceptionally significant in terms of a change in policy.  They are there because we think they are playing an important role in helping facilitate the necessary process of repairing markets et cetera.  If we were going to take them back tomorrow or dial them back substantially, then I would be willing to rationalize and explain that part of the judgment is that we think things are improving materially.  I just feel as though the risk is too high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 150.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think the Vice Chairman raises an interaction that I hadn’t thought of, which is that our facilities are existing under the premise of unusual and exigent circumstances, and we don’t really want to undercut that.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that the Vice Chairman has raised a point that they hadn't considered before, implying agreement with his perspective.


Passage number 151.
 MR. FISHER.  I would support what Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned because I think we may be faced with a situation of having to raise rates even though there is considerable risk in the financial market.  So I think showing sensitivity to that is very, very important.  On a second point, Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the change in the language.  I also suggested some changes to alternative C, but I won’t go into them.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is expressing support for Vice Chairman Geithner's suggestion and showing appreciation for the change in language. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 152.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The given passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. The statement "President Plosser" alone does not indicate any conflict or dissent between individuals or groups.


Passage number 153.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Given that I suggested removing the word “considerable,” my purpose there was merely to indicate, as many people around the table have said, that things are somewhat better.  I don’t think that we should suggest that problems are solved, because things are still under stress.  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner in that regard.  I am willing to withdraw that suggestion.  I don’t feel that strongly about it.  I thought it would have been useful to convey a direction that we saw.  But I don’t disagree with Vice Chairman Geithner’s suggestion that these things can reverse themselves and maybe a little more stability might save us some zigging and zagging down the road.  So I withdraw that suggestion.  I can live with the language as it is, if that simplifies things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is expressing agreement with Vice Chairman Geithner's suggestion and is willing to withdraw his own suggestion. He states that he can live with the language as it is, indicating no disagreement or contention.


Passage number 154.
 MR. MISHKIN.  And it will come out in the minutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that something will be revealed or discussed in the minutes.


Passage number 155.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Of course, all of these subtleties will.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. It simply states that "all of these subtleties will" be discussed or considered.


Passage number 156.
 MR. PLOSSER.  As they always do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Plosser believes that actions occur in a predictable manner.


Passage number 157.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would like to propose no change in alternative B as given in exhibit 1.  Any further comment.  If not, could you please take the roll.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their preference for no change in alternative B and requesting further comments or feedback. The request to take the roll is unrelated to the statement about alternative B.


Passage number 158.
 MS. DANKER.  Yes.  This vote applies to the directive as well as the language of the statement in alternative B of exhibit 1.  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a statement about the vote and the accompanying language in alternative B of exhibit 1.

Thank you.  Why don’t we take a fifteen-minute coffee break, and we will come back and discuss investment banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It lists the names of various individuals, their titles, and their agreement ("Yes") on an unspecified topic.


Passage number 160.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don’t we commence, then.  This is a joint FOMC and Board meeting, and so I need a motion to close the Board meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the need for a motion to close the Board meeting.


Passage number 161.
 MR. KOHN.  So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.
The passage simply states "Mr. Kohn. So move." There is no indication of any disagreement or contention between individuals.


Passage number 162.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Without objection.  Okay.  Our topic for this morning is investment banks, their supervision, and related policy issues.  Let me turn it over to Art Angulo of the New York Fed, who will introduce the topic.  Art.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. The phrase "without objection" implies that there was no disagreement among the participants regarding the topic. The subsequent statements are introducing the topic and handing over the floor to Art Angulo, but there is no indication of disagreement.


Passage number 163.
 MR. ANGULO.5  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We’re now in the handout.  Why don’t we start on page 2, and I’ll give you an overview of where we are headed this morning, at least from my section.  First I’ll talk a bit about the objectives and the approach of our monitoring program.  Then I’ll talk about how we’re focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on four investment banks and where our focus is there.  I’ll say a few words about the extent of usage of our section 13 facilities.  Again, the PDCF is primarily our focus, but for the sake of completeness, I’ll also discuss and provide some highlights on TSLF usage by the primary dealers.  Then I’ll close by just highlighting near-term issues that we’re addressing or dealing with.   5 The materials used by Messrs. Angulo, Alvarez, and Parkinson are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). On page 3, in terms of the objectives of our monitoring program, we’re very cognizant that our efforts are tied closely to our section 13(3) authority in the establishment of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.  Our effort does not stem from our general supervisory examination authority.  We’re very clear on that.  We have two key objectives.  The first is the ability to exercise informed judgment about the capital and liquidity positions of the primary dealers that have access to the PDCF.  Second and just as important, we’re aiming to, in shorthand, mitigate the moral hazard that accompanies the creation of the PDCF in particular.  So we will make sure that the PDCF does not undermine the incentives for the primary dealers and the firms that own them to manage capital and liquidity more conservatively.  On page 4, in terms of our approach, our focus is on the firms that own primary dealers that are not affiliated with financial holding companies.  That’s primarily, but not exclusively, the four largest investment banks.  I’ll touch at the end of my presentation on several other primary dealers with which we’ve had interactions of late.  Our effort does include an on-site presence, but that is limited to examiners at each of the four largest investment banks.  We also have a small off-site staff, which includes staff members from our Research Group, our Markets Group, our Legal Group, and Bank Supervision.  We are in direct contact with the management of these firms.  We are obtaining information directly from the firms as well as from the SEC, and of course, we are communicating and coordinating closely with the SEC.  It’s important to point out, however, that we’re not engaged in traditional bank supervision.  Our scope is fairly narrow.  We’re not conducting examinations, and we’re not providing or issuing examination reports back to the firms.  Therefore, we are making assessments, I would say, without the normal range or normal complement of supervisory protections that we’re accustomed to.  To be frank, that carries with it some risk and some vulnerability for us.  I’ll touch on that at the end of my presentation as well.  Our current focus is limited or narrowly focused on capital, as well as liquidity, which I’ll get into in a moment.  So let’s turn to page 5.  Page 5 gives us a view of the leverage of the four investment banks.  I should note that it may be a bit confusing at first glance.  Leverage is typically expressed as a multiple.  We’ve converted that into ratios because bank supervisors tend to look at ratios.  So bear that in mind.  Investment bank leverage does tend to be cyclical.  This graph picks up really the latter half of the last cycle, so I can orally give you some perspective.  If this graph had moved back to the left, in approximately 1999 to 2001 you would have seen the investment banks deleveraging in response to the Russian default and the LTCM crisis in the third quarter of 1998.  So we would see leverage coming down between then and 2001.  In 2001-02, leverage was essentially flat, and then this graph picks up the increasing leverage from 2004 to the end of 2007.  As you can see, 2007 marked the cyclical low point in the ratio, or high point in leverage as a multiple.  Since then, the firms have been deleveraging.  Right now they are clustering around 4 percent, with the trajectory, I hope, still up, and we may have something to say about that.

  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Art, could you define “leverage” in this picture.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 165.
  MR. ALVAREZ.  Well, as you can tell from Art’s presentation, there’s been a significant amount of information-sharing and collaboration already between the Federal Reserve and the SEC.  So we’ve taken this opportunity simultaneously with what’s going on with the primary dealers to fashion a document that will lay out a framework for how this information-sharing and collaboration will go forward.  We’ve made some pretty good progress on a document, but we’re still negotiating.  In fact, the Chairman is negotiating this afternoon with Chairman Cox.  This is one in which the principals have been intimately involved.The agreement as it is currently structured really has two parts.  The first part outlines plans for sharing information between the two agencies.  Here I would divide the world into two pieces.  There are the consolidated supervised entities (CSEs), which are the four large investment banks—Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch.  We have agreed to share information and analysis of the financial condition, risk management, internal controls, capital, liquidity, and funding resources of those firms.  The agreement is focused primarily on those areas—so the financial condition, liquidity, and risk management of the firms.  As you know, we have accessed information from these companies in connection with our providing liquidity through the PDCF and the TSLF, so we’ll share that with the SEC.  Similarly, the SEC, which is the primary regulator for those and has access to much more information, will share their information with us.  We’ve also agreed to share information and analysis on various financial markets that these companies are intimately involved in—in particular, the tri-party repo market and the interbank lending market.Now, two bank holding companies participate in the SEC’s CSE program—Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.  We have agreed to share with the SEC the same type of financial and risk-management information regarding those two firms but only to the extent that that information affects the broker-dealers that are controlled by those two firms.  So we are not expecting, nor is the SEC expecting us, to share information that relates to the condition of the bank or the condition of the other nonbank portions of either of those two firms—just the part related to their broker-dealer.  We have an interest here in the Federal Reserve in the financial condition of broker-dealers that are not in the CSE program.  That would be any broker-dealer that’s in a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve.  Our plan is to include an information-sharing arrangement regarding those institutions as well.More broadly, the SEC would provide us with information on an ongoing basis about the financial condition and risk management, internal controls, capital, liquidity, and funding resources of all broker-dealers that are controlled by a bank holding company.  This would allow us access beyond what we’re currently getting.  Right now we’re getting primarily FOCUS reports on the broker-dealers, which are not always the most informative documents.  So we’ll get more access.  We also are expecting to agree to provide similar kinds of financial and risk-management information to the SEC, again to the extent that the information affects the broker-dealer.  So we would not be routinely providing information about bank holding companies related to the bank or related to the nonbanking operations that are not broker-dealers.  We also are expecting to include a provision that outlines several existing agreements that we have for sharing information regarding some of the clearing companies—DTC in particular—transfer agents, municipal securities dealers, and investment advisers.  This would simply incorporate, without changing, the arrangements we already have.  An essential part of all this sharing of information is that both agencies would agree to keep the information confidential.  In addition, the SEC is agreeing not to use our exam or supervisory information, in particular any opinions that we might have, in their enforcement actions or investigations without the permission of the Federal Reserve.  The second part of the agreement, as we’re working through it, relates to supervisory expectations for the four large investment banks and for the primary dealers that have access to the PDCF and the TSLF.  There the current proposal is that the two agencies would agree to collaborate and coordinate with each other in obtaining access to the information on the financial condition of these organizations and in setting supervisory expectations concerning the capital, liquidity, risk management, and funding for the CSEs and the primary dealers.  We’d also collaborate and coordinate our communications to those entities about supervisory expectations, something that’s already begun with Art and his group.The memorandum of understanding (MOU) is intended to serve as a bridge from the existing world to whatever brave new world the Congress may put together.  But it is not tied specifically to the PDCF or the TSLF and is intended to last beyond access to those facilities.  It also does not change the legal authority that either of the two agencies has.  We continue to have full, unfettered legal authority over bank holding companies.  They continue to have full, unfettered authority over the broker-dealers.  But we do agree to talk more, collaborate more, and coordinate more.  As I mentioned, the MOU is substantially worked out.  We are still, though, in negotiation over a couple of key points.  Our goal is to have it done this week, we hope with an announcement at the end of the week or sometime next week.  We expect that the terms of the MOU will be made public.  As soon as we have something that’s concrete enough, we’ll also send that around to you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily explaining the progress and negotiations involved in a document that outlines information-sharing and collaboration between the Federal Reserve and the SEC.


Passage number 166.
   MR. PARKINSON.  Thanks.  I’m just going to go over the last few pages of the handout you have, pages 13 through 15.  Page 13 is just a table reminding you who the primary dealers are and providing some basic information about their size, borrowing activity, and regulatory status.  As you probably know, there are currently 20 primary dealers, although as Art mentioned we’re about to lose two of them—Bear Stearns and Countrywide.  An important point to note, which ran through Scott’s presentation, is that although the investment banks—the four firms that are subject to consolidated supervision by the SEC under their CSE program—are among the largest primary dealers, there are some very large bank-affiliated dealers, including not only affiliates of U.S. banks but also affiliates of German, Swiss, British, and French banks.  Also, if you look at column 3, you’ll see—and these are data that we get from the two government securities clearing banks that facilitate tri-party repo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York—that it shows that the investment banks are not, in fact, the largest borrowers in the tri-party repo markets.  Rather that distinction belongs to Deutsche Bank, Banc of America, and Barclays.  I think that’s significant because arguably the biggest threat from Bear’s bankruptcy was the impact on the availability of secured financing, especially from money funds and other highly risk-adverse investors that provide tri-party financing to the dealers.  So we have some very large borrowings by those non–investment bank firms.  Columns 4 and 5 provide some information about how these firms are regulated.  Essentially the legal entity itself in every case but one is a broker-dealer regulated by the SEC, and in that case it’s a government securities dealer regulated by the Treasury but the SEC really does the enforcement of those Treasury regulations.  Finally, all of these firms except one, Cantor Fitzgerald, which is an inter-dealer broker, are subject to some form of consolidated supervision by one or another consolidated regulator, although the regimes can differ appreciably.  The OTS has a regime for Countrywide, I guess being a notable example itself, quite different from the one that we would apply.  So with those facts in mind, turn to the next two pages.  I don’t intend to go through all these questions, but what we’ve done here is set out some issues for discussion.  Basically there are two sets, one relating to the future of our liquidity facilities for the primary dealers and the other relating to the supervisory arrangements through which we’re seeking to mitigate the moral hazard that those liquidity facilities create.  In each case, there are questions about what to do under current laws, until such time as the Congress may change those laws.  Then there are questions about what legislative changes we might seek, particularly if the Congress shows an inclination to legislate in this area.  Our purpose for this list of questions is to stimulate a discussion among you about these important issues and to provide you with an opportunity to express any preliminary views you may have.  With that, I think we’d be pleased to answer questions on any of the three staff presentations.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information and explaining certain facts. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 167.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Questions for our colleagues.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there are questions for colleagues and mentions President Lacker without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 168.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  Thank you, Art, Scott, and Patrick, for a very forthcoming presentation.  Two things for you, Art:  First, on page 8 you presented some information about the details of the stress test that you’re applying, and the table lists various unsecured funding and secured funding from other sources, and you have numerical assumptions for the severity of stress.  I take it that you apply those to the balance sheet numbers and do some calculations to calculate the stress test.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and asking for clarification on a specific topic.


Passage number 169.
 MR. ANGULO.  Correct.  We went back to the firms and asked them to give us the information cut this way because it’s not readily available from any public information that we have.  We also asked them to give us, under a severe test scenario, what their assumption was.  Based on the submissions that we got from the four, which we converged and massaged, we came out pretty close to these assumptions.  We didn’t make these up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply explains the process of collecting information from different firms and how they arrived at the assumptions.


Passage number 170.
 MR. LACKER.  I was going to say that you essentially asked the question, What does “severe” mean in your stress system.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement where Mr. Lacker acknowledges that the question asked is similar to the one he was planning to ask.


Passage number 171.
 MR. ANGULO.  We left it somewhat in their hands, saying that it’s going to be short of a full run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement made by Mr. Angulo is a simple statement of fact, stating that they left something in the hands of others.


Passage number 172.
 MR. LACKER.  Then you had some iteration to get to an agreed-upon set of numbers for these.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It is solely talking about a process of iteration to reach an agreed-upon set of numbers.


Passage number 173.
 MR. ANGULO.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: 
Since the passage only mentions "Yes" in response to an unidentified statement or question, it does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply suggests an affirmative answer.


Passage number 174.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Now, you also said that you started your first iteration by asking them to give you the results of a Bear Stearns failure scenario.  What numbers does that correspond to on this table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple question and does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 175.
 MR. ANGULO.  You would have a lot higher numbers on secured funding.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Angulo about the potential increase in numbers for secured funding.


Passage number 176.
  You would have the numbers coming much closer to the illiquid, 100 percent, and you would have a— MR. LACKER.  Well, wait.  I’m sorry.  I lost you there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The interruption by Mr. Lacker does not indicate disagreement, but rather a momentary confusion or loss of understanding.


Passage number 177.
 MR. ANGULO.  Under fixed-income finance, for example, under the secured funding, there’s liquid and less liquid.  Those are 20 percent and 50 percent.  Those would have been approaching 100 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states different percentages for the categories of liquid and less liquid under fixed-income finance. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 178.
 MR. LACKER.  So the severity, that’s how much of the money goes away.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the severity of a situation and how it affects the amount of money.


Passage number 179.
 MR. ANGULO.  How much runs—exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question about the exact number of runs.


Passage number 180.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  So do you have those numbers for Bear—what they actually experienced.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 181.
 MR. ANGULO.  The SEC is working on a post mortem.  They have promised to share it with us when they’re done.  They have folks—I wouldn’t say forensic accountants—in there looking at that, trying to piece together what happened.  So we did not have the exact numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states the fact that the SEC is working on a post mortem and will share the findings with them. They also mention the presence of individuals studying the situation but clarifies that they are not forensic accountants.


Passage number 182.
 MR. LACKER.  You didn’t have the exact numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states that Mr. Lacker does not have the exact numbers.


Passage number 183.
 MR. ANGULO.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 184.
 MR. LACKER.  But you knew roughly what they were.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that the person being addressed had a rough idea of what something was.


Passage number 185.
 MR. ANGULO.  Things moved pretty quickly at the end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply states that things moved quickly at the end, without any conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 186.
 MR. LACKER.  I see.  Well, I was just interested in information on exactly how that transpired.  If there’s a chance that you could share with us that information when you get it, that would be very useful.  A second question for you:  You noted reputational risk from being in on the supervisory basis, and I want just to probe as to how you think about that.  What eventualities would be risky for us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing interest in obtaining information and asking a second question for clarification.


Passage number 187.
 MR. ANGULO.  I guess a couple.  We’re saying that we’re looking at the capital position.  I think Governor Kohn was careful to say in his testimony that we’re looking at capital in relation to near-term earnings prospects.  That gives us kind of a short window, but we know from examining banks that a capital number that’s reported to you depends on how you’re carrying your assets.  We have not done any work in trying to get behind, for example, the evaluations on Lehman’s commercial real estate portfolio.  That’s a potential vulnerability there.  Also, we have not really looked to a consolidated assessment of risk management at these firms, something we do in the bank supervision process.  So we’re basically taking the inputs, for lack of a better word, at face value and not doing our own work to try to validate those.  That’s what I was referring to in terms of the risk to us.  I think as long as we’re there, people expect us to be doing a little more than what we’ve been doing to date.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Angulo explaining the limitations of their assessment of capital positions and risk management at banks.


Passage number 188.
 MR. LACKER.  So it’s essentially the risk that, after the fact, marks are questioned, and they ask, “You guys were in there—why didn’t you . . ..”  I understand that.  Thanks.   The third question is for Pat.  You talked about the repo market.  My understanding is that some supervisory work under the LFI (large financial institution) umbrella is aimed at conditions in the repo market and mitigating some risk there.  You mentioned that it was obviously an important factor in Bear.  To what extent do you think paying interest on demand deposits would obviate the need for the huge volume of transactions in the repo market and the extent to which that legislative prohibition could have contributed to the market structures and fragility that gave rise to what happened in Bear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges understanding the risk mentioned and asks a question for clarification.


Passage number 189.
 MR. PARKINSON.  I can’t answer that, but that’s a good question.  I mean, the basic problem here is that you have a tremendous demand for investments that have essentially the characteristics of Treasury bills, but the supply of Treasury bills isn’t nearly as large as that demand coming from money market mutual funds and from investment of cash collateral on securities lending and other kinds of secured financing.  Over time, the marketplace has come up with synthetic Treasury bills of various sorts, but those short-term investments have been created outside the banking system by and large because the inability to pay interest on demand deposits doesn’t allow them to be provided by the banking system.  Now, if that prohibition were removed, I think you would see banks offering things that would be competing with overnight repos, overnight commercial paper, and other sorts of things that are outside the banking system that are meeting these needs. In terms of the effects on stability, whether that leaves us in a better place obviously would depend on how good a job we do of regulating maturity transformation by the commercial banking system.  An interesting question there is—whenever I hear Art give his presentation and look at these stress tests we’re applying to the investment banks, even under current conditions, when they’re not offering overnight interest-bearing deposits—how well our banks would fare if we tested them against these standards.  But I think your observation and your question are good ones.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and offering additional information to support the original point.


Passage number 190.
 MR. LACKER.  I mention that because it sounds as though it would be worthwhile knowing if it’s important.  Since we’ve asked the Congress twice now for permission to pay interest and they’ve declined, and if this was a factor in the recent crisis, we might want to point that out to them as part of our legislative dialogue with them over the next couple of months to try to get them to do something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 191.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation:
This passage does not include any information or context that could suggest contention or disagreement. It simply states the name "Governor Kohn."


Passage number 192.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a comment on President Lacker’s question:  I guess in the end it would depend on how big Bear Stearns’s balance sheet would have been and whether paying interest on demand deposits at commercial banks would have somehow shrunk Bear Stearns’s balance sheet and the secured funding that could then run.  So it’s pretty complicated.  It’s not obvious to me whether it would have made Bear Stearns a smaller player and a less significant part of the market, but it’s interesting.  Tim looks as though he wants to say, “Yes, it would.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kohn is simply stating his thoughts and uncertainties about the potential impact of paying interest on demand deposits at commercial banks on Bear Stearns.


Passage number 193.
” VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  No.  May I.  You know, we think that the money funds finance about a quarter or a third of the stuff in tri-party.  Money funds have a unique type of liquidity risk.  So it is possible, if the same set of assets were financed by banks, that because banks have a different liquidity risk the system would be more stable.  So you can maybe say, even with the same balance sheets as investment banks and the same mix of illiquid stuff financed through that mechanism, if the banks were the dominant providers of liquidity or it was provided through banks, that the system would be more stable, and the broader protections that we designed over the last century to limit the risk of runs on banks because of the risk to the system might have more power, insulating us from a system where nonbanks are large.  I think that’s the argument.   It would be interesting to know a bit about the politics on the Hill of thinking about that legislative change.  It would probably look a little like the Middle East, I suspect.  [Laughter]  That would be a huge change in the relative return on different types of financial businesses that now would come with that.  But it would be worth knowing a bit about the history of that debate in the past and what the probability is that we could get something like that through.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It primarily focuses on discussing the potential stability of the financial system if banks were the dominant providers of liquidity instead of money funds, and the potential implications of such a change. The mention of "politics on the Hill" and the need to understand the history and probability of legislative changes suggests a potential area of debate, but it is not directly addressed in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 194.
 MR. KOHN.  I also had a question, Mr. Chairman, and it’s on the PDCF.  I find some tension in my own attitudes here.  Your leaning all over these people not to borrow helps protect the Board’s decision that this is unusual and exigent, credit couldn’t otherwise be available, and all of that.  So it’s supportive of that.  On the other hand, it sounds really like what we used to do with commercial banks all the time and thought it created stigma in the process.  We don’t want you to borrow.  If you come in and borrow, given that we don’t want you to borrow, you must really be hurting to overcome Art Angulo’s or Bill Dudley’s frown.  So I think the more we do this, the less useful this thing is as a backstop in some sense.  I don’t know.  I don’t have an easy answer as to how to resolve this tension.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kohn, expresses a tension or disagreement between two contrasting perspectives on the issue of borrowing. On one hand, he acknowledges that discouraging borrowing can support the Board's decision that the situation is unusual and exigent. On the other hand, he suggests that this approach may create a stigma and undermine the usefulness of the borrowing option as a backstop. Therefore, there is a conflict or disagreement between these two perspectives within Mr. Kohn's statement.


Passage number 195.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, may I—not to preempt Art and Scott—in this case.  I completely agree.  It is very important not to undermine the value of these liquidity backstops by introducing stigma in their use until we get to the point at which we want to dial people back.  But the decisions or the actions we took in the context of Cantor and Countrywide had a very compelling rationale.  It would have been irresponsible for us, given the facts that over Cantor we have no comparable framework of supervision and that their exposure was very large relative to capital.  In that context, we could do it without any risk that we were going to stigmatize the use of the PDCF because it’s a unique thing.  Countrywide, as you know, had a slightly different but similar rationale.  It would have been imprudent for us to have had a substantial amount of securities outstanding, insufficiently collateralized, in the event that the deal didn’t go through, because they were not viable on their own without Bank of America’s buying them.  That was a necessary and prudent thing to do.  I think also that the risk was very limited that we introduced stigma to the facilities.  The Barclays thing was more delicate.  We would not say to them, “You can’t use the facility.”  We just asked some careful questions about what they were doing and why, because their pattern of use was so different from everybody else’s in that context.  But I completely agree with your concern about that stuff.  I think we must be very careful going forward that we don’t do things that will alter this balance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of the speaker explaining and expressing agreement with the decisions and actions that were taken regarding certain financial institutions.


Passage number 196.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, you had something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply addresses President Lacker and implies that he has something to say.


Passage number 197.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  About the general topic of stigma and lending at our facilities, I think it would be a useful agenda item for future research, and it would be useful for us to work at thinking carefully about this.  Stigma represents some information revelation to market participants attending on some act, whether it’s borrowing from us or from someone else.  The usual presumption is that more information is better.  We talk as if stigma is a bad thing.  So I’d want to see a model that lays out how the sense in which it’s a bad thing counteracts the sense in which information is usually a good thing.  I’m really curious about that.  I think it’s something we ought to think more carefully about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that stigma in lending is a topic worth researching and that more information is generally seen as better. They express curiosity about how stigma may counteract the usual benefits of information but do not argue against it.


Passage number 198.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser, did you have a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 199.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I asked Bill Dudley yesterday a question about what I had heard from the Street—that they perceived that stigma was attached to it.  With this conversation, it certainly appears to me that I was hearing them say that, at least from the investment banks’ point of view, they do feel that some stigma is already attached to it, good or bad.  Now that I’ve heard this discussion, it is consistent with what I was hearing from those Wall Street firms.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is mentioning that there may be a disagreement between the perception of stigma attached to something and the actual viewpoint of the investment banks.


Passage number 200.
 MR. DUDLEY.  May I just interject one thing on this.  Vice Chairman Geithner makes the important point that one issue is counterparty risk for Cantor and Countrywide, which was sort of separate.  The other issue is, since this is permissible only under section 13(3), that it can’t be a chronic source of funding and it can’t be part of their core funding plan.  We want to make it clear to them that this is going to go away, and we want to be confident that they’re not dependent on the PDCF as a source of funding.  So I would distinguish between Barclays coming in occasionally with Barclays coming in every day, and that’s really the point we were trying to make to them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a clarification and distinction being made by Mr. Dudley regarding the use and limitations of the PDCF (Primary Dealer Credit Facility).


Passage number 201.
 MR. ANGULO.  It may be too fine a distinction, but we didn’t say “no” to anyone when they came in.  When they came in and stayed for a month and a half or two months, then we started to say “no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement explaining that initially, there was no refusal to let anyone in, but after a certain period of time, they began saying "no." There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument present.


Passage number 202.
” VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  But these are very different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting ideas or arguments. It merely states that two things are different without expressing any disagreement or controversy.


Passage number 203.
  I’m sorry— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Go ahead.  Finish your sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 204.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I was just going to say that it’s a very delicate balance.  We want this set of firms to get themselves to the point where, in the eyes of the market, they have a more conservative mix of leverage (appropriately measured) and funding risk so that they are less likely, even in a pretty adverse shock, to need to finance illiquid stuff with their central bank as a defense against that liquidity pressure.  We’re trying to do that without forcing a level of deleveraging that would be adverse to our broader objectives of trying to get markets back to some point where they’re functioning more normally.  We’re not going to get that perfect.  By definition, our facilities by design should allow them to run with a mix of leverage and liquidity risk that is above what the market probably now would permit.  In the absence of our facilities, leverage and liquidity risk, if you measured it on a scale, would have to be lower in some sense.  But that’s the purpose and the necessary complement of the facility, and it is a delicate balance. But just to come back to President Plosser’s point, I don’t think that the stigma is the result of how we’re applying the discretion we preserved for ourselves around use.  It is really the result of the fact that, particularly if you’re at a point when you perceive escalating concern about your viability, people don’t want to risk that their pattern of use, if disclosed, would magnify the concern.  That’s really what accounts for the care in use, particularly as concern about viability has been intensified these last few weeks or so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 205.
 MR. DUDLEY.  If I could add just one more thing, I also think that the stigma doesn’t really undercut the benefit of the PDCF as a backstop to these firms’ financing.  If the stigma really undercut the benefit, then the stigma would be quite important.  But I think that the PDCF is still a very viable backstop even with some stigma associated with it in the current environment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any elements of contention or disagreement. It simply presents the viewpoint that the stigma associated with the PDCF does not significantly diminish its benefit as a backstop for firms' financing. The statement does not contradict or oppose any other viewpoint or argument.


Passage number 206.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig, did you have an intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question is simply asking if President Hoenig had an intervention.


Passage number 207.
 MR. HOENIG.  Yes.  To follow up on Governor Kohn’s point, I think it’s important to our discussion going forward in terms of how we view these firms, from commercial banks to investment banks and primary dealers, because we are lending under exigent circumstances to these institutions under the primary dealer facility.  Therefore, they almost by necessity should be concerned about stigma if they were to continue to borrow through there.  On the other hand, it’s important because the TAF is a different instrument and has different implications going forward in how we think about it and whether we want stigma with that.  I think about how and how broadly we view different financial institutions, that is, investment banks.  Are they blending into commercial banks.  What about beyond that.  We are going to have discussions about other types of financial institutions—should they not continue to be lent to only under exigent circumstances versus an ongoing TAF type of arrangement.  So I think there is stigma and probably should be unless we are concluding that they’re more like banks than not like banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing the importance of considering stigma and how financial institutions should be viewed and treated in different lending arrangements. There is no conflicting opinion presented in the passage.


Passage number 208.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’re going to have a chance, of course, for everybody to give their views.  President Fisher, did you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement indicates that everyone will have an opportunity to share their opinions, and then asks President Fisher if they have a question.


Passage number 209.
 MR. FISHER.  I just wanted to get in on this point that Governor Kohn raised.  I’m not uncomfortable with our being parsimonious with the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.  It is under unusual and exigent circumstances, and I think we need to be sure that they are unusual and exigent circumstances.  That’s the reason it was created, and I think we have to respect that.  I’m just wondering, judging from the decline in the extent of the outstandings and given what you described, can we assume that there’s a lessening of unusual and exigent circumstances.  That’s my question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely expressing agreement with the idea of being parsimonious with the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and asking a question for clarification.


Passage number 210.
 MR. ANGULO.  I would defer to my colleagues in Markets, but I would just give one anecdote.  Over the past few weeks, in particular, when Lehman announced its second-quarter results, some observers in the market stated that Lehman might not have come through this period if the PDCF had not been there.  They never drew on it.  I think it’s an interesting point.  I think there may be some relevance, some truth, to that.  Bill, you would have a better sense as to whether the markets are back to normal or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is deferring to their colleagues and sharing an anecdote about the potential impact of the PDCF on Lehman's ability to come through a difficult period. They also acknowledge that their colleague would have a better understanding of whether the markets have returned to normal.


Passage number 211.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t think they’re back to normal, and I also think very strongly that the amount of use of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility is not a guide to how important it is as a backstop for financial firms.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and belief without conflicting with any other viewpoint.


Passage number 212.
 MR. FISHER.  That’s my point.  That’s important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply emphasizing the importance of their point.


Passage number 213.
 MR. DUDLEY.  There were a number of people to whom we talked who said that the reason they stayed with Lehman during this period of stress was that they knew that the Primary Dealer Credit Facility was there as a backstop.  So I have a high degree of confidence that Lehman would have been in great difficulty without it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Dudley, expresses confidence that Lehman would have faced significant trouble without the support of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility based on the conversations with people they talked to.


Passage number 214.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Just to make sure—it isn’t quite as awkward as it sounds.  I mean, it’s not clear.  The test for us about whether or not these make sense is not fundamentally about whether the PDCF would save Lehman from itself.  I would just make the observation that we thought originally that you could look at the bid to cover and at the clearing price in the auction facilities as a measure of stress in markets, and they would be a test by which you could see conditions.  I think it’s important to recognize that that’s not itself a particularly useful prism on stress today.  Independent of the specific circumstance around Lehman, the people who are funding tri-party balance sheets, for better or worse, tell anybody who listens that they’re doing so significantly because of the existence of this facility as a backstop.  So the use is not a very good measure of stress probably because of the stigma around it and because we’re affecting prices anyway by the existence of these facilities. We’re doing as much as we can to improve the odds that these firms get to the point at which, in the eyes of their short-term secured or unsecured creditors, they look as though they can withstand a pretty large shock in the future without recourse to our facilities.  But I don’t think we’re at the point yet where we can say that confidently, not because they haven’t deleveraged sufficiently or bought enough liquidity—though there’s a bit of that still left—but because there’s so much uncertainty left still about the scale of pressure on balance sheets, what that might do to the losses, what that might do to asset prices going forward or to behavior.  So this is just one man’s view, but I think a very good, substantive case based on what you can observe and what people say about behavior suggests that circumstances are still so fragile that we could justify the provision of these facilities as a responsible, sensible act given our broader objectives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their viewpoint and opinions on the usefulness of certain measures and the uncertainty surrounding the current circumstances.


Passage number 215.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Did you complete your questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not include any contentious or disagreeing elements. It is simply asking whether the questions have been completed or not.


Passage number 216.
 MR. KOHN.  Yes, I did.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kohn simply replied "Yes" to indicate that he did do something.


Passage number 217.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 218.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I just have a couple of questions of fact.  How big was Bear Stearns’s tri-party repo on the Thursday that they started getting into trouble—just to give a rough sense of scale.  I know it’s not exact.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for factual information about the size of Bear Stearns's tri-party repo.


Passage number 219.
 MR. ANGULO.  About $150 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a figure, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas being presented.


Passage number 220.
  MR. ROSENGREN.  About $150 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information that suggests contention or disagreement. It merely states an amount of money, without any conflicting statements or contrasting viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 221.
 MR. LACKER.  That Thursday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The presence of "That Thursday" suggests a possible contradiction or differing opinion from another person involved in the conversation.


Passage number 222.
   MR. DUDLEY.  It was a little over $100 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Mr. Dudley about the amount of money is presented as a factual claim without any opposing viewpoint or contradiction.


Passage number 223.
 MR. LACKER.  It hadn’t run off that week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply stating a fact that the situation described had not occurred during that week.


Passage number 224.
 MR. DUDLEY.  It was starting to run off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only provides a statement by Mr. Dudley. There is no indication of disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 225.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Okay.  So roughly $100 billion.  The numbers seemed to be in that range.  Now, one of the reasons that we’re worried about the tri-party repo was that the securities in that tri-party repo were very illiquid.  Was Bear Stearns unusual in the amount of illiquid securities that were being financed.  As we look down this list, is the nature of the tri-party repo across these different parties similar or different.  You could have a tri-party repo with collateral that would be easy to liquidate, or you could have a tri-party repo with something very difficult so that the counterparty would have a difficult time actually selling it into a distressed market.  From the work you all have been doing, are there big differences or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is asking a question about whether there are big differences in the nature of tri-party repos across different parties.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 226.
 MR. ANGULO.  There are definite differences among dealers.  I don’t have the Bear Stearns cut, but we did a cut recently, and there are very clearly differences among dealers.  As we know, the share of less liquid assets being financed by tri-party has been growing over the last—pick a number—five, seven years.  The trend line is going like that, clearly at a steeper or more pronounced rate than the growth in more liquid or more eligible collateral.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage states that there are "definite differences among dealers," indicating that there is some contention or disagreement regarding the performance or practices of these dealers. Additionally, the statement about the growth rate of less liquid assets being financed by tri-party compared to more liquid collateral suggests a disagreement about the allocation of resources or risk management strategies among dealers.


Passage number 227.
 MR. PLOSSER.  So—I’m sorry—what percentage would that be.  When you say it’s growing, is it now 10, 20, 50, or 80 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply asking for clarification on the exact percentage of growth.


Passage number 228.
 MR. ANGULO.  Pat, do you have that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and does not involve conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 229.
 MR. PARKINSON.  I have in front of me data from Bank of New York, which facilitates about two-thirds of the repos.  At Bank of New York, 18 percent of the collateral is debt that’s settled through DTC—so that would be non-government, non-agency debt—and another 6 percent is equity.  So about 25 percent is non-OMO things.  The biggest chunk by far is agency MBS.  Of course, I think in extremis Bear was having trouble financing even agency debt, importantly given the illiquidity that had developed in even the agency debt markets at that time, which was the critical thing that made investors no longer willing to provide financing for that kind of collateral with a shaky counterparty.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 230.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  For Bear Stearns, we have one side of the transaction looking at the investment banks.  On the other side of that transaction, you have companies like Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated.  So as we think about who poses systemic risk, we probably want to think about both sides.  In terms of a distress scenario, you have tri-party repos that are very illiquid.  The clearing bank does not want to provide the cash.  As a result they have to liquidate, and you have companies like Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated having to break the buck, and they don’t have much capital to infuse.  So just as we think about systemic risk, as you’re looking at these other organizations, are there other people that you would add to that.  I know for Bear Stearns that Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated played a very large role.  Were there other organizations that we ought to be thinking about that would have the same kind of nature.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that companies like Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated played a large role in the collapse of Bear Stearns, while implying that there may be other organizations that should also be considered for their role in systemic risk. This implies that there may be differing opinions or perspectives on the causes and extent of the collapse.


Passage number 231.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Well, the other big category that we have been able to identify of entities that are providing tri-party financing is the custodian banks that act as agents for securities lenders.  When someone lends out securities, they often take in cash collateral.  Then they want to reinvest that collateral, and the big bank custodians do that on their behalf and invest a portion of that cash in tri-party.  Interestingly, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon are two of the big banks involved in that particular business.  So that’s another category. I think maybe what you’re getting at is about dealing with the issues of the tri-party market per se.  We have to be very careful in our approach to these issues because the situation is still very fragile, and until we get out of this period of turmoil, we first want to do no harm there.  But any solution can’t be focused solely or even primarily on the clearing banks and the way they process these transactions, although that’s part of it.  It also has to focus on the behavior of the borrowers and the lenders, and the borrowers are basically all of these primary dealers and certain other big broker-dealers.  The lenders are more diverse, which makes them more difficult to deal with.  But I think there are certainly questions about whether they’re managing their risks effectively.  If you’re a money fund and you’re treating an overnight repo secured by illiquid collateral as the equivalent of an overnight Treasury bill, there’s something problematic about that in terms of your own thinking about the situation you’d be in if, in fact, the borrower were unable to repay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is providing information about different entities involved in tri-party financing and discussing the need for careful consideration of the issues involved.


Passage number 232.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  One last question.  Sorry for so many questions.  The situation of Lehman was kind of interesting because you saw their stock price go down.  Talking to financial institutions, both regulated and unregulated, in Boston, a lot of people were evaluating counterparty risk and deciding whether or not they were going to start running before the capital issue.  Did your measures of liquidity pick up the amount of stress that was going on in the counterparty analysis being done, I assume, all over the country.  One of the conditions for an institution’s access to the discount window at a primary credit rate is that it not be rated a 4 or a 5.  I know we’re not doing bank exams, and I know we’re not looking at all the elements of the bank exam.  How confident are we, if we were to do something like that for Lehman or for Merrill Lynch, that we wouldn’t rate them a 4 or a 5.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not present any sort of contention or disagreement. It is simply asking a series of questions and seeking information.


Passage number 233.
 MR. ANGULO.  On the first question, yes, we were picking up the pressures on liquidity.  We saw some cracking, but it never broke.  There were some counterparties that were skittish, but we never saw the type of accelerated withdrawals or running that came to mark Bear Stearns.  We were watching it very closely, and so were they.  But basically it hung together.  The second question is a very difficult one.  It goes back to the point I finished on, that we are somewhat vulnerable in making these assessments without having a more robust process.  One way to look at it in the near term, though—again, as best we can, looking at capital—is the chart on page 6.  If you look at Lehman—with its capital raise, their tier 1 risk-based capital would be 12.5 percent.  There may be some range around that.  There are certainly questions about how accurately Bear’s capital was stated.  But as a rough measure, I think it would be difficult to say that Lehman would be a 4 or a 5, looking at it from a solvency perspective.  They’ve bolstered liquidity.  As I said, it started to crack, but it never really shattered.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information and discussing the assessment of liquidity and capital in Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, but there is no clear disagreement or contention between different parties or viewpoints.


Passage number 234.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Warsh, did you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 235.
 MR. WARSH.  Not a question, just for the go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement made by Mr. Warsh, so there is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 236.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don’t we then have an opportunity for general comments on these issues.  Let me just give a bit of context.  When we instituted the PDCF and the TSLF in March, about the time of the Bear Stearns event, we stipulated that they would be available for up to six months.  That date, mid-September, is coming closer.  It’s my view, and I think others share it, that markets remain fragile, and in the case of Lehman, for example, the existence of the backup was an important support in maintaining the stability of that institution.  Therefore, given the state of the markets and given that I think we still face some systemic risks, I am quite inclined at this point to ask the Board to extend the PDCF and the FOMC to extend the TSLF over year-end, which is a difficult period—subject, of course, to the continued finding of unusual and exigent circumstances.  If we do that, I would ask the Board to consider that in a Board meeting, and depending on the comments today, if there’s sufficient support, I would ask the FOMC to do that in a notation vote later this month. Now, if we make the announcements that we’re going to at least provisionally extend these facilities, I think it’s important that we do so in the context of explaining that we have an exit strategy.  In particular, we are working to strengthen supervisory oversight, market resilience, and the overall regulatory structure so that there is understanding and confidence that we’re moving forward in a way that will over time make this unnecessary not only in the short term but in the long term as well.  There are several parts to the plan here.  One, as Scott already described, is the memorandum of understanding with the SEC, which will provide the basis for cooperation and collaboration in the medium term for our oversight of the investment banks.  Two, working with the SEC, we’d like to push forward along the lines that Art was describing, go beyond where we are now, and begin to establish a set of supervisory expectations regarding what we expect to see for the investment banks and to make sure that we have greater confidence in what we’re doing and what they’re doing.  A third element that I think is important as we go forward is to try to improve the financial infrastructure in a number of dimensions.  A lot of this work is already taking place at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, working with other regulators and with the private sector.  It includes things like improving the clearing and settlement process for various kinds of derivatives and improving risk management of derivative positions and counterparty positions, for example.  It would be important for us going forward to make sure that major institutions can identify their exposure to a given counterparty through derivatives and other instruments and be able to close out that counterparty in an efficient and effective way.  In addition, work is going on here at the Board and in conjunction with New York on the tri-party repo market, trying to think of ways that we can strengthen that—perhaps, for example, by narrowing the range of collateral that is normally accepted and through other steps. So the way I would envision this proceeding would be—again, with your assent and subject to your comments—that we will announce within the next few days the MOU agreement with the SEC, which I would reemphasize is not tied to the PDCF.  That is, we would anticipate that this relationship would continue even should we close those facilities, on the grounds that the moral hazard issue is still there, until such time that there is further resolution by the Congress.  Second, I’ll be giving a speech at the FDIC on July 8, followed by testimony on regulatory reform on July 10, when Secretary Paulson and I and others will be laying out some broad principles, including some of the issues of infrastructure, and will be discussing some of the longer-term legislative issues—for example, the issue of how we should perhaps normalize or regularize the resolution of a failing systemically important firm and, in so doing, maybe define more strictly what the parameters are for Fed lending and what our responsibility is in this kind of situation. So to summarize, the MOU is this week.  There will be testimony coming up.  Presumably after the monetary policy testimony later this month, we would like, conditional on your approval, to announce the extension of these facilities conditional on continuing unusual and exigent circumstances.  We would like to package that with a series of announcements concerning investment bank expectations, infrastructure, and as part of this environment as we talk about this in testimony and so on, some of our thoughts about how we might go forward in terms of statutory change in the future.  What I’m trying to convey is that, although I think we need to extend these facilities, we should do it in a context of increasing clarity about how we are working to make them less and less necessary in the future.  So with that as context, let me just open the floor for any comments that people might have.  I have first President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their viewpoint and plans for extending certain facilities and improving regulations, and is seeking input and approval from others.


Passage number 237.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I agree with you that we need to define limits, but I think we have stronger tools than just our declarations of piety.  I would just note that there are models.  One good model is the FDICIA model, for example, which lays out a whole set of criteria under which intervention can be taken and, if intervention is taken, has a set of rules.  There are ways through the legal structure to solve some of these problems without our necessarily having to make time-inconsistent promises.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a viewpoint and offers a solution to a problem.


Passage number 238.
 MR. LACKER.  I agree, and those are mechanisms for legislatively tying our hands, and that ought to be high on the agenda.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not involve any disagreement or contention. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses agreement with a previous statement about mechanisms for legislatively tying their hands being important.


Passage number 239.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’ll discuss those.  Yes, President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "We'll discuss those" suggests agreement and willingness to engage in a discussion, while mentioning President Plosser is not necessarily indicating disagreement.


Passage number 240.
 MR. PLOSSER.  On that point, I have been reading a bit recently.  It might be useful in thinking about some of these issues about how we tie our hands and the mechanism for doing that.  The IMF went through an extraordinary study effort during the sovereign debt crisis and came up with some very important mechanisms for how to change the contracts that were being written by sovereign countries so as to avoid the IMF’s having to step in and look for other solutions, which is, I think, along the same lines.  I don’t know whether or not there are things from which to learn in parallel with that to think about how we approach that issue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of personal interest and a suggestion for considering the issue at hand.


Passage number 241.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 
(Explanation: The passage only mentions President Rosengren, without providing any context or information about any controversy or disagreement associated with him.)


Passage number 242.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I have three comments for the long term and three comments for the short term.  For the long term, in the tradeoff between focusing on markets versus institutions, to the extent that we can have standardized products traded on exchanges, we don’t need to spend as much time with institutions, and that takes care of a lot of the counterparty risk.  To the extent that the products have to be customized and done in dealer markets, then we have counterparty risk and that becomes an issue.  So I applaud what the New York Fed is doing with the credit default swap market in thinking about a way to more systematically reduce counterparty risk.  I wonder if we should more forcefully be trying to push it not only to a clearinghouse but also maybe to exchange traded.  I know there is a tradeoff between standardized products and nonstandardized products.  But if we can get things to be more standard so that they can trade on an exchange, we won’t have to spend as much time talking about some of the issues that we’ve been talking about.  Not just a credit default swap market has that characteristic.  So if we can push a number of areas in which there’s counterparty risk into an exchange, then we can get out of the business of focusing on all the institutions. The second point is that there’s a broader role for us as a holding company supervisor.  When I look at this list and look at Countrywide, it’s not because they’re a primary dealer that I would be focused on them.  It’s because they were 20 to 25 percent of the residential mortgage market; they were a very large player.  The OTS has holding company supervision over them.  We ought to ask ourselves whether now is the time to think about what organizations we ought to have holding company responsibility for.  The OTS has WaMu and had Countrywide.  We ought to give some thought to that.  Now is the time to think about whether or not that’s appropriate and push for it if there are going to be legislative recommendations.  In terms of broker-dealers, I think the same thing applies.  I don’t think that we should be the primary regulator for these organizations.  But if we’re going to be lending to them in exigent circumstances, having holding company regulatory authority does become important. The third point is that, when you look at this list, there are a lot of foreign institutions.  One insight that we’ve gotten is that an organization as big as UBS could potentially fail.  That may not be something that we thought was very likely nine months ago, but it is obviously more likely now than we would have anticipated.  Foreign organizations can either establish themselves as a branch or have a domestic holding company.  To the extent that foreign supervisors decide to wall off their organizations around their geographic borders and say that, if there is a problem, we’re not going to support institutions that are in the United States and you’re on your own, I think we need to revisit some of our rules on how much capital we expect foreign holding companies that are intermediary holding companies to hold.  We might also want to think about, if there’s a lot of activity being done through a branch that has no capital supporting it, how concerned we should be about that.  Should we be taking actions to make sure that, if the foreign parent decides that they are going to abandon the branch, we feel very comfortable with that outcome.  Given the list of the primary dealers, I think the numbers are fairly large, larger than they were for Bear Stearns, and that’s something that we probably should give a bit more thought to. On the short-term issues, I certainly think that we should extend the facilities past the end of the year.  That makes perfect sense.  A number of us have made the point that the markets are still fragile.  Just the announcements about Lehman Brothers over the last month highlight that we’re not yet safe, and I think that it makes perfect sense to extend through the end of the year because there could be an end-of-the-year financing problem this year.  Second, narrowing tri-party repo collateral also makes sense.  But it has implications for what securities people hold, and some of those markets may become much more distressed if we announce that they no longer can be part of a tri-party repo.  So we need to give some thought to whether there will be collateral damage and to the unintended consequences from that.  Third, I agree with President Lacker that primary dealers wouldn’t be where I’d focus.  I’d focus on systemically important.  That would be key players and key markets whose failure might cause a cascading of counterparty failures.  I think we ought to start with that premise and which organizations fit into that category.  Some of them will be on the primary dealer list, but they are on the primary dealer list for a reason very different from the reason they are systemically important.  So maybe distinguishing between those two would be useful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing their own thoughts and suggestions on various issues and topics.


Passage number 243.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Hoenig.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 244.
 MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, on the short term, I think extending through the end of the year is prudent and would support that.  I would say that the possibility of its naturally dying off would be ideal.  I would support that because it is “exigent circumstances.”  We should make that clear and work these people out of it as quickly as possible.   On the longer-term issues, I share the view of a lot of what President Lacker said.  A couple of things:  I’m very uneasy about extending our lending and supervisory authority to these institutions on the basis of systemic risk.  The banking industry has been under our umbrella, importantly around transactions activities—that is, payments—and how important they are systemically.  It’s clear, and a line is there.  Beyond that, it is size that’s systemically important.  If we extend this and institutionalize it because we’ve had this emergency and we’ve used section 13(3), then I have to ask what will happen when the next Long-Term Capital occurs that’s larger, more complicated, with a lot more interaction that will affect the markets globally.  What will we do.  To what then will we extend ourselves in terms of supervisory oversight, memos of understanding, agreements for the group of hedge funds that aren’t regulated, and so forth.  So I think it’s important that we focus on the fact that this is an emergency and that we go back to “exigent circumstances” in the future for these institutions so that we have clear boundaries on that.  I think it has served us well and will continue to serve us well.  Then we use our best judgment in exigent circumstances and very sparingly.  I think that’s a lot of what President Lacker said, so I won’t repeat everything else, but those are the concerns that I really do have going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses uneasiness about extending lending and supervisory authority to institutions based on systemic risk, while acknowledging the importance of addressing short-term emergencies.


Passage number 245.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 246.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  May I make a suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for permission to provide a suggestion or offer some advice.


Passage number 247.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage because it is a simple suggestion without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 248.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Yes.  You know, these are deep, consequential questions we face.  This is a question on the economy, and we’re not going to resolve it today.  I think it’s important that we recognize that we’re going to have to build some time into our agenda—later this year probably, certainly early next year—and get deeper into the basic question about what we are for in the future.  What amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, if any, would we support.  What would we resist.  What mix of these things.  That’s important because we’re not going to do an adequate job of getting ourselves on the table on those actions today.  We are going to need to be very careful that the stuff we’re doing in the here and now doesn’t prejudice those decisions long term.  Again, I think the package that the Chairman laid out and the strategy we have are pretty carefully designed to mitigate that risk.  We’re trying to be very careful that we’re preserving full optionality, once we get through this particular period, to go on any of the paths that are ahead in this context.  Of course, this short-term stuff is vulnerable to the risk.  It looks as though we’re prejudicing some of those choices, but I think we’re trying to be careful not to do that.  I just wanted to make the point that we’re all going to need a little time to think through this stuff, and we’re going to need some time to come back and talk about the deeper policy questions that we face in this because they are very consequential.  I have a lot of sympathy for all the concerns that are on the other side of where we are today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily focuses on the need for deeper discussions and careful consideration of policy questions.


Passage number 249.
 MR. HOENIG.  I would very much like to see us make that happen sooner rather than later just because of the force of events taking us forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Hoenig expresses a personal desire for something to happen sooner rather than later but does not indicate any disagreement or contention with anyone else.


Passage number 250.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s right.  Because of testimonies and so on, we are going to have to at least enunciate some broad principles, and that is why this discussion is very useful.  Obviously, details will be worked out over a longer period.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is a need to establish broad principles and that further details will be discussed in the future.


Passage number 251.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes, I just have a few comments.  In reading through this memo and hearing the presentation this morning, I think that these are fantastic questions.  They deserve a lot of research and analysis.  Just to echo Vice Chairman Geithner, they cannot easily be answered in a forum like this one.  What is happening is that we start out looking at these questions, which just spawn more and more questions; so we end up with an even longer list of questions.  The short-term strategy seems perfectly reasonable, somehow tied to an exit strategy maybe next year.  So I didn’t have any problems with that as outlined by the Chairman.   When we get down to approaching a more detailed analysis of what we want to do overall, it brings up very difficult questions of what the optimal regulatory environment is.  I think that we all think the regulatory environment in the United States is not optimal right now.  Also, in a world of increasing globalization, it is not so clear how you should set up your regulatory structure.  This is a once-in-a-generation chance to possibly reformulate the regulatory structure.  I wouldn’t hold my breath on that.  I think the Congress does not have a great record of dealing with issues like this.  These issues are complicated, and it is very hard to get agreement on them.  But you would like to have a benchmark.  I think that one is out there in the economics literature about what that environment should look like.  That is what we could possibly work on over the next nine months or so. Then I have another comment.  When we are evaluating these programs, we have to think about whether these programs have been effective and to what extent.  How do we measure success.  One of the comments earlier was that the mere existence of the programs might be success in some sense.  In a model, that is going to work.  Even if you take it out of existence, because the market knows it’s there and you can put it back into existence in the future, it will have exactly the same effect.  Whether or not you have the program in place, the equilibrium is going to be the same in a lot of models, so the effects would still be there.  If it is just the potential of putting the program in place that is considered successful, then maybe it is not critical whether it is in place but priced not to be used or whether it is actually taken out of existence temporarily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and comments on the topic being discussed, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 252.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the following passage without additional context or information. The passage "President Fisher" alone does not provide enough information to identify any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 253.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I am in favor of keeping these facilities open through year-end as you have suggested.  I think that just the existence of the PDCF is important, which we talked about earlier, and your overall outline of an approach, the topography of that approach, is attractive.  The question I have is about—and you used the term—“supervisory expectations.”  I have a question for Scott, and then a thought to follow up on.  Since, Scott, no one asked you a question, I want to ask you a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the suggestion to keep the facilities open through year-end and praises the existence of the PDCF. The speaker also poses a question and expresses interest in hearing from Scott. There is no indication of any opposing views or disagreement.


Passage number 254.
 MR. ALVAREZ.  I was perfectly content to get through this without any questions.  [Laughter]  But I am happy to answer anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Alvarez simply states that he was content to not be asked any questions, but is willing to answer any if there are any.


Passage number 255.
 MR. FISHER.  In working up this MOU, have you had any interaction with Chairman Frank or any of his staff, getting a sense of how they might react or what it does in terms of their own expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply asks about any interaction or communication with Chairman Frank or his staff in order to understand their expectations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 256.
 MR. ALVAREZ.  Well, we have had a bit of interaction on the Senate side.  The Senate folks are very interested in what we are doing and whether this would preempt a congressional action.  Chairman Frank has been more sanguine about our doing what is appropriate to deal with the situation now—Laricke may speak to this more at the lunchtime conversation.  But we are building on existing authority.  We are not expanding beyond the existing framework.  We are agreeing to collaborate more, work together more, but we don’t gain any legal or statutory authority through this MOU.  We gain some admission because we are standing next to the SEC.  We expect that the primary dealers and CSEs will be more willing to talk with us because we are with the SEC.  But in the end, it depends on voluntary cooperation by all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. The mention of Chairman Frank being more sanguine about the actions being taken suggests that there may be differing opinions or approaches to dealing with the situation.


Passage number 257.
 MR. FISHER.  Are you picking up any signals in return, in this interaction with the Senate or elsewhere, about what they might be thinking.  Are we picking up any other signals that might be of concern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply asks a question about whether any signals or concerns are being picked up.


Passage number 258.
 MR. ALVAREZ.  On the House side, Chairman Frank is thinking of a model that is similar to what the Treasury blueprint outlined, where the Federal Reserve would be a systemic regulator and have some authorities that go along with that.  I think that on the Senate side they are very much in disarray.  They want to visit this issue, but they haven’t figured out exactly what point of view they want to have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states the differing viewpoints of Chairman Frank on the House side and the Senate side. It does not indicate any direct contention or disagreement between them.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 259.
 MR. FISHER.  I am a little confused.  You testify in July and then have a speech.  You said that you and Paulson will be speaking.  I think that is a very important point.  It is going to be a tough act because you don’t want to take anything off the table, but you want to keep a lot open and not show your hand.  Well, we don’t know what our hand is yet.  You may, but I don’t think we have it as a group.  So we can’t really show our hand.  Anyway, I don’t know how this is going to be prepared, but I’m sure there are lots of feelings around this table.  This is the substance that Vice Chairman Geithner referred to earlier—these very, very important questions.  But you are going to have to show some leg during that speech.  Obviously, this is a Board issue, but with regard to the FOMC, I would just ask that it be fairly carefully vetted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, expresses confusion and uncertainty about the upcoming speech and the need to show a strong position while also keeping options open. He mentions that he doesn't know what the group's hand is and implies a disagreement or differing perspectives within the group.


Passage number 260.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I was planning to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is straightforward and does not involve any conflicting opinions or conflicting parties.


Passage number 261.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.  Just for some suggestions, for whatever they’re worth.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude to the Chairman for something, indicating a positive attitude.


Passage number 262.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no statement or indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "President Stern" is a neutral statement without any explicit disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 263.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a few points.  With regard to the short-term plan of extending the facilities over the turn of the year and so forth—that is, the MOU and the testimony that goes with it—that is all fine with me.  I don’t have any problem with that.  That sounds sensible under the circumstances. A number of important points have already been raised.  I won’t reiterate all of them.  Maybe the one that caught my attention most completely was President Lacker’s point about credibility.  Whatever we go forward with obviously has to be seen as credible, and as he pointed out, it is important that at some point, to limit our involvement in supporting institutions and markets going forward, we may have to be prepared to let one large institution fail.  The reason, of course, that we are very concerned about protecting them over time is the spillover effect.  As I have said many times before, where we need to concentrate our efforts—not necessarily exclusively, but certainly in part—is in devising ways to limit spillovers.  That is all about preparation—the analysis and so forth that goes with it—and it is all about communication—that is, putting uninsured creditors on notice that the regime is in fact in the process of changing. Now, having said that, I don’t mean to suggest that it is easy.  I don’t mean to suggest that we will get it 100 percent correct.  But if we don’t do those kinds of things, then statements about boundaries aren’t likely to be credible.  They are just going to be, well, you guys wish it were this way, but you have section 13(3), and we know it’s there, and we are going to act accordingly.  So I think it is very important, as we go forward with this, that we focus some attention exactly on those areas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement with the short-term plan and acknowledges the importance of credibility in the actions taken by the institution. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 264.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a statement of gratitude and a mention of President Yellen without any indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 265.
 MS. YELLEN.  I will be very brief, Mr. Chairman.  I do want to say, with respect to the short-term issues, that I fully support the plan that you laid out.  I certainly favor keeping these facilities in place beyond September.  Even if their use diminishes, I agree with the point that it doesn’t necessarily indicate that they are not playing a tremendously important role.  The ramping up of our oversight of these institutions in the agreement with the SEC is a very important part of continuing these facilities. On the long-run issues, it is a wonderful list of questions.  I don’t know the answers to the questions.  I think we really need to dig in very rapidly and do serious work on them.  They are fundamental.  President Rosengren raised a list of issues about this, the same ones that have been very much in my mind.  What institutions.  It is not obvious to me that the right list of systemically important institutions is the primary dealers.  I think someone—maybe President Rosengren—raised the issue of Countrywide, a huge mortgage company.  I certainly worried last summer that it had created systemic risk, and it is not just the primary dealer there.  I also think there is an issue with respect to hedge funds, similar to those that arose with Long-Term Capital Management.  This raises very troubling issues to me about our trying to identify and take on supervision of all systemically important institutions.  This is a very tough issue that I don’t know the answer to.   But also, what is going on raises fundamental issues about how we conduct consolidated supervision.  Even if all the systemically important institutions were primary dealers or mortgage companies within bank holding companies that currently we do have umbrella supervision over, I am not at all convinced that the way we are carrying out supervision now would have prevented a Bear Stearns-type of episode within an institution that is currently solidly under our supervision.  Last summer I was pleased in some ways that we had lost direct supervision of Countrywide to the OTS.  But it might well have been in our domain—six months earlier it would have been—and it could have created a systemically important problem if it had failed.  So just the nature of how we carry out this Fed-lite approach, is that really the right way.  I see us as very focused on process in our supervision of holding companies.  We don’t do a lot of transaction testing.  Obviously, this raises very fundamental issues, even within our existing domain, about how we carry out comprehensive umbrella supervision.  I don’t have any answers, but we clearly need to get on it quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The speaker expresses agreement with some points while also raising various concerns and posing questions. They are unsure of the answers and emphasize the need for further investigation and action. This suggests there is disagreement or contention within the passage.


Passage number 266.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "President Plosser" is simply stating a title or position without offering any conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 267.
  MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be very brief.  A lot of my views have been shared already.  Just to expand on President Rosengren’s comment—how we define the right institutions, the scope of this, I think that some of the questions here are really hard.  It is my understanding that the workgroups we talked about last time are going to be working on some of these things, and we need to get those well under way to help us define these problems.  On the longer-term problem—Vice Chairman Geithner made this point, and I just want to reiterate it—it is really important in the short run that we not do things that constrain our longer-term options.  It is a very slippery slope that the long run ends up being transformed into a series of short-term steps, and by that almost inevitably you end up in places you don’t want to be.  So I just want to make sure that we stay abreast of that and not let that happen to us—that we find ourselves six months from now in a position where, gee, we wish we hadn’t done that.  So I just wanted to stress that again. I’m fine with extending the facilities through the end of the year.  I don’t have any tremendous problem with that, although I have always been a little puzzled by “unusual and exigent circumstances.”  What does that really mean.  How do we define that.  It would be a lot easier for me to think about when to take it off if I knew what the criteria were for putting it on.  It would be helpful to me, anyway, if we could work on defining those criteria a little more rigorously.  I know there will be judgment involved in that at the end of the day.  I don’t disagree with that.  But it would help us to define what we mean by that because it is going to be really hard to define what we mean by a “systemically important institution.”  I am not sure I know the answer to that.  I think it is a very difficult question.  So I am okay on the short run.   I will just reiterate the other point that President Stern made about the issue of credibility and commitment.  You know, I have talked a lot about this over the last couple of years regarding monetary policy.  It applies equally well in this framework.  Figuring out ways to implement our policies, whatever they may be, in both a time-consistent and committed way, and defining those boundaries and how we live up to them, is a really hard problem.  But I don’t think we can avoid dealing with it, and it is going to be a critical piece of how we think about the longer term.  I will just leave it at that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker raises a few points and expresses some concerns, but there is no clear contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 268.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply expresses gratitude towards President Pianalto.


Passage number 269.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also support extending our lending facilities to get through the year-end funding problems.  As many others have already said, I agree that we should undertake an evaluation of the changes to our emergency liquidity facilities.  I think it is important that we do it more broadly and that we don’t do it in a piecemeal fashion.  How the pieces fit together matters greatly.  Any extension of Fed authority to provide routine liquidity support beyond insured banks should be something that we consider as part of a comprehensive regulatory and financial safety net reform.  My own view may be that I prefer a narrower lending facility than I think was envisioned in some of the documents that we received, but I do think that the top priority is to have a well-thought-out, documented plan for how we move forward.  That will help us address some of the moral hazard issues that we have been concerned about.  I think it will avoid our having to create any new institutions or new facilities to respond to future crises.  I also think it will help better define some of the boundaries.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Ms. Pianalto, expresses support for extending lending facilities and agrees with the need for evaluating changes to emergency liquidity facilities. She also suggests considering a narrower lending facility and emphasizes the importance of a well-thought-out plan to address moral hazard issues and prevent the need for new institutions or facilities in future crises. There is no indication of disagreement or contention with anyone else's views.


Passage number 270.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards someone named President Lockhart.


Passage number 271.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I have maybe a variation on Governor Warsh’s comment of yesterday:  Much has been said by many, so I will try not to take too much time here.  I think Vice Chairman Geithner’s admonitions are correct, and I certainly support them.  I am quite supportive of extending through the year-end, and the short-term plan that the Chairman laid out seems quite sensible to me. I don’t have well-informed or well-thought-out answers to the more detailed questions that were posed in advance of the meeting.  I didn’t devote the time to study them in any depth.  So let me take refuge in some sort of high-level comments.  A number of people around the table have been expressing overview types of comments.  I see the touchstone of all of this to be our perceived accountability for systemic risk and financial stability.  There may be, in the context of legislation, regulation, and so forth, limits to that; but I think that we are largely perceived as the most accountable party.  I have to ask myself, Do we have a system today that is aligned with the reality of the financial markets.  Or, put in more vernacular terms, do we have the right stuff to do what we need to do to take responsibility as best we can for financial stability.  My answer to that is “no.”  I don’t think we have the right stuff.  I think the answer to that lies in working out the details of what the right stuff is.  But the reality is that financial markets are not bank-centric any longer, with the widely discussed shadow banking system, including hedge funds, a complexity that is not going to go away; international integration that is not going to go away; very, let’s just say, compelling economic and financial reasons for off-balance-sheet treatment of various kinds of things; and on and on.  We could make a long list of what that reality is.  To me, and I have been kind of dwelling on this for some time, that is a reality that is likely to continue.  It may take a couple of steps back, but it will continue to develop along certain lines.  Do we have a system that is aligned with it.  The answer to that is “no.”  So if we can take care of the short-term plan and then buy the time over the next several months to hammer out what we think is the best possible thinking opposite that reality, then that is what I believe we need to be doing.  So thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses support for Vice Chairman Geithner's views and the Chairman's short-term plan. He also acknowledges the challenges and complexities of the financial markets and states that the current system is not aligned with those realities. He suggests working out the details to better align the system and expresses agreement with the need to buy time and develop the best possible thinking in light of the current reality.


Passage number 272.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude from President Evans.


Passage number 273.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will also try to be brief, in spite of the large number of questions that were handed out.  The short term should be quite easy.  On the tactical issues, I agree with the suggestion of extending the facilities through year-end.  They seem to have worked well.  Also, a number of very interesting and important initiatives are ongoing as well on the CDS over-the-counter market and tri-party repo, and those should help out as well. On the longer-term issues, I am very happy to hear that you will be giving a speech and testimony on this, and I will be looking forward to how you lay out those issues.  Obviously, there are large-scale changes in our regulatory environment that are being contemplated.  These happen only every now and then.  It is an opportunity to improve or to make a tremendous mistake if we are not very careful.  So I think it, obviously, requires a tremendous amount of time. People have talked about the various issues, so I won’t dwell on them.  I think there have been a lot of very good comments around the table and speeches that have laid out the important issues that we are facing.  One that I am sure we will have to talk a bit more about is that we can’t think about this in a static environment.  Obviously, the markets are very dynamic.  As soon as we lay out a structure that will help out certain types of institutions, then there is going to be an opportunity to arbitrage that.  We are presumably talking about reducing earnings of a number of institutions, and so they will be seeking those out.  Another way to characterize the big question—it is nothing new—is how we maintain the incentives for market discipline.  Many of the comments that President Stern and others made about how we think about preparing for possible resolutions will be very important.  So I am looking forward to many more discussions about this.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker seems to be largely in agreement with the suggestions and initiatives discussed, and expresses enthusiasm for further discussions on the topic.


Passage number 274.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude towards Governor Kohn.


Passage number 275.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I would just like to dig into some of the comments that President Lockhart and President Evans just made, just for a second, take a step back, and ask why we are here having this conversation.  I know the timing is because we have this PDCF, but what happened was that the financial markets evolved in such a way that simply having a liquidity backstop for commercial banks was not sufficient to protect the economy from systemic risk.  I myself have been very surprised—I will be very open about this—at the persistence, the extent, the depth, and the spread of this crisis and how long it went and what it covered.  Every couple of months, I thought it was about to be over, and then another wave would come.  I think that we have learned something about the financial system in the process, and we have learned that the regulatory structure and the liquidity provision structure were not sufficient to give the economy the protection it needed from the new style of financial system.  That is really the background of why we are here, not just because we made the loan or we set up the facilities because we thought we needed to do so to protect the system under the circumstances. I completely support, Mr. Chairman, your suggested path forward for the near-to-intermediate term.  I think that is the right way to go.  I would say, relative to the two senators that I testified in front of last week, that they were very supportive of the memorandum of understanding between the Fed and the SEC and particularly supportive of the efforts that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the other regulators are leading to strengthen the infrastructure of the OTC derivatives markets.  We didn’t get into tri-party repos, fortunately.  But I’m sure they would have been supportive of that, too. I think everybody has raised very good questions about where, in this new financial system, you draw the boundaries.  What do you need to do.  There are no easy answers here, and I look forward to coming back to this.  My going-in position is that our liquidity facilities outside of commercial banks ought to be available in systemic circumstances, not in just any circumstances, and they ought to be available at this point to just broker-dealers or investment banks.  I would hesitate to get outside that realm.  Those guys are already regulated, and so what we’re talking about is strengthening the regulation.  I think that we can strengthen the core of the system to make it resilient to things happening outside, but I am not totally dug in on that.  So I look forward to more discussion.  It is going to be very hard to draw the line and make it credible.  I agree, partly this will be defining what we mean by “systemic,” but I don’t think we will ever really get to the point of having a bright line around that.  It will always need a great amount of judgment, combined with—as you said, Mr. Chairman—a process by which you make that decision, to help limit the moral hazard.  Crises are always difficult.  You get into a crisis, and the near-term costs are much more palpable than the long-term costs that might be there.  So it is always hard to say “no.”  We have said “no” in the past on certain circumstances.  Drexel is the obvious example.  Markets were a little stressed.  There was a little disorder.  It was fine, but it was a very different circumstance.  I think that completes my remarks.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly consists of the speaker expressing their support for the suggested path forward and discussing the need to strengthen regulatory structures. There is no indication of opposition or disagreement with any specific statements or views.


Passage number 276.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.

Passage number 277.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any information or statements that suggest contention or disagreement. It simply contains a thank you message addressed to Governor Kroszner.


Passage number 278.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  I agree with a lot of what Governor Warsh said and a lot of what has been said before.  Let me just take a slightly different tack answering the question that Governor Kohn raised:  Why are we here.  Part of that is, because of the Glass-Steagall Act, we have this unusual structure in the United States.  Other central banks can provide credit much more easily to a wide variety of institutions.  We have a legacy that created this separation, which isn’t as strong in most other countries.  In continental Europe, for example, you just don’t really see this.  Then, we have built a regulatory regime that helped to promote that.  Remember, the discussions have been about markets and the challenges in the markets.  Well, I think our regulatory regime, not just in the United States but throughout the world, helped promote the disintermediation to promote greater reliance on the markets.  In certain ways this is a very good thing, but it creates exactly the kinds of problems and challenges that we are facing now. I think we need to be mindful of that and take that into account when we are thinking about what to do next in dealing with these issues.  Thinking about market resiliency and market infrastructure is crucial, but we also have to be mindful that, if we try to get things to migrate to the exchanges, to clearinghouses, et cetera, it is great for us as regulators, and it is also useful because the information is much more centralized.  But it also could create market dynamics, as President Evans said, that could lead to trying to get around that.  Then the risky stuff goes OTC.  The risky stuff is in new institutions that we haven’t thought of yet.  President Yellen mentioned some other institutions.  We can mention hedge funds and money market mutual funds, but in five years there may be institutions that we haven’t even thought about.  No matter what structure we set up, there would be ways to try to get around it.  So we need to think about a regulatory regime that gets the costs and benefits right to make the different relevant institutions not bridle too much at being part of it and so to rethink the financial holding company structure.  If the investment banks had found the financial holding company structure an amenable one, then we wouldn’t be here either because we would have solved the Glass-Steagall legacy problem.  But we haven’t quite done that. So actually exactly as Governor Warsh was saying—and believe it or not, we didn’t coordinate beforehand—I think that we should think about how to revise our general regulatory structure to get more institutions under this umbrella, not have them find it scary, upsetting, or disturbing but to see that we are doing it in a reasonable cost–benefit way.  I can see just in all the issues that we have been facing regarding some capital relief in particular circumstances—so-called 23.80 relief on particular types of transactions, issues of what’s included in the definition of a leverage ratio.  I think it gives us an opportunity to rethink why so many institutions find it onerous and are so lacking in desire to be part of this regime.  Obviously, there is some regulatory competition—President Rosengren, I think, brought that up—so we need to think of that as a whole.  This is part of the homework assignment that the Congress needs to think about—setting up a reasonable FDICIA-like regime for a broader set of institutions that would choose to come and be regulated by the Fed. We have been talking about where the bright lines are.  But if we okay someone to be a financial holding company, then they become part of our regime in the existing structure.  So the lines aren’t completely carefully drawn.  It really is sort of a cost–benefit analysis if someone chooses to apply.  So we need to think about that carefully and about the costs and benefits of getting people in because the long-term dynamics will be that people always try to get away from regulation unless they see that there is some sufficient benefit.  Being very mindful of that, both from the institution context and the broader context of the markets, is very important.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not presenting any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is offering their perspective and agreeing with points raised by others. They are discussing the regulatory structure in the United States and suggesting the need for revision to include more institutions.


Passage number 279.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude with the phrase "Thank you."


Passage number 280.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Oh, and I apologize—I fully support going ahead with extending the facility past the year-end.  I would make sure that it’s a bit more than just immediately past year-end and go some time into February so there are no questions about year-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker clearly expresses their support for extending the facility past the year-end.


Passage number 281.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. 

The passage simply expresses gratitude to someone named Governor Mishkin without any indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 282.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also strongly support the short-term strategy that was laid out by the Chairman.  I don’t see that we really have an alternative in that context.  There are a lot of issues here.  The reality is that this is super complex, and we have a lot of work over the next year to be ready for the next Administration, when all these issues are going to become extremely relevant. In general terms, regarding the long-term issues, although we got here under exigent circumstances, in a financial disruption, we might have gotten here anyway.  The reality is that there was a fundamental change in the way the financial system works.  When banks are not so dominant, the distinction between investment banks and commercial banks in terms of the way the financial system works is really much less.  It would be nice to think that we could limit the kinds of lending facilities that we have so that we didn’t have to worry about regulating or supervising other institutions, but I don’t think that is realistic.  The nature of the changes in the financial system means that we extended the government safety net but it probably would have been extended anyway.  It was just unfortunate that it had to happen in such a crisis atmosphere.  So I think we have to think very hard about the issue of limiting moral hazard in terms of a much wider range of institutions. I am very sympathetic to the issues that President Stern raised, which is that we have to think about the kind of things that we have thought about more in terms of the banking industry:  How do we actually set things up so that it is easier for firms to fail and not be systemic.  There are a smaller number of firms that we actually have to supervise and regulate, and the reality is that we have to think very hard about how we’re going to extend regulation and supervision to a wider range of firms.  We just can’t escape that.  It would be nice to say that we could limit it, but we are not going to be able to limit it except to the extent that we can think about some of these issues.  But it is going to be a huge issue going forward, and we really have to be ready to deal with the political process. The way we are proceeding makes a lot of sense.  It is not committing us in a way that creates a problem, but we have to be ready when this issue is dealt with.  It will be one of the hottest issues that the next Administration and the next Congress will have to deal with.  We have to be really on point and to have positions very carefully thought out, not just by the Board but by the entire FOMC and the entire System, so that we can have a unified position to make sure that crazy stuff doesn’t happen and that sensible stuff does.  Thank you.

Passage number 283.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude to the Vice Chairman.


Passage number 284.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I obviously support the strategy laid out.  I just want to underscore, particularly in response to Governor Warsh’s comments, that this is in effect a conditional extension, in the sense that we are being careful to get ourselves more comfortable with where these four firms in particular are on capital and liquidity before we announce an extension.  We are trying to get clarity on the ongoing supervisory relationship with the SEC before we announce an extension.  We have already gotten the 18 major dealers in the world to commit themselves to a path to improve the capacity of the OTC derivatives infrastructure to withstand failure before announcing.  We have already begun to get the resources held against default risk in the existing central counterparties higher, in satisfaction of President Stern’s general admonition that we want the system better able to withstand failure.  I think we are just beginning the delicate process of taking some of the air out of the vulnerable tri-party repos before the extension is announced.  So, in that sense, we have left ourselves in this strategy that the Chairman laid out with a little less vulnerability to the possible impression that we would just willy-nilly extend with no effort to make the system safer.  We are not going to get far enough.  We are not going to know what’s far enough.  But I think we have a credible plan to say, “We took the initiative, even in a moment of incredible delicacy for dealing with the system, to try to get these institutions and the system in a better capacity to withstand the possibility of failure.”  In that sense it’s a defensible and sensible strategy. I really don’t know what the right mix of boundaries is on access to liquidity in normal times and in extremis and what mix of supervisory authority conditions with what type of resolution regime is optimal.  I just don’t have a sense.  I feel as though I know the broad tradeoffs in it, but I don’t know what really looks ideal in terms of the mix of those things.  You can make a pretty reasonable case for a whole bunch of variance in that mix of things.  The complication for us is that we won’t be able to fully control the outcome because it is going to require legislation.  Part of the consequence of the system that we live with and part of the reason that we live with the system we have today is that policymakers and regulators don’t fully control the outcome in terms of the incentives created in the legislation for these kinds of things.  So it will be difficult for us, but all we can do is focus on the merits, think through those ahead of everybody else, and try to have the best package of suggestions that we can.   But just to come back to what we spent most of the last two days talking about, let’s not lose sight of the fact that we are in the middle of this still.  It likely has a long way to go.  It is very hard for us to know now what we are going to decide at the end was the most critical source of vulnerability and, therefore, what to do to fix it.  We don’t know what the market is going to think the new equilibrium should be in terms of the return on equity across different types of financial institutions and models.  Another reason to be careful as we try to contain the risks in this crisis and make the system stronger in the near term is so that we don’t prejudge some of those longer-term questions.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing support for the strategy laid out and discussing the steps they are taking to make the system safer. They acknowledge that there are uncertainties and challenges in determining the best course of action, but overall they believe it is a sensible strategy.


Passage number 285.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Thank you. President Plosser" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing gratitude towards President Plosser.


Passage number 286.
   MR. PLOSSER.  I want to come back to one of Governor Warsh’s comments, just probe it a little further, because I was intrigued by his notion that in some way trying to wean ourselves from this he suggested that we raise the price.  It occurred to me in that same context, if we thought that had value in some sense, another way we could do the transition is to cut back either the frequency or the size of the TSLF, as we sort of wean the markets off access.  Announcing both those things in advance might have some value to us moving forward.  I wanted to hear other people’s thoughts and reactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is discussing the idea of weaning markets off access and exploring different ways to achieve that goal. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is presenting his own thoughts and seeking input from others. There is no explicit disagreement or conflict mentioned.


Passage number 287.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The term "Vice Chairman" does not suggest any disagreement or contention. It simply denotes a position or title within an organization.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 288.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  First, I completely agree that, once we get to the point at which we believe the best policy is to dial this stuff back and transition to a world in which they don’t exist, we are going to want to look at a whole bunch of things—changing terms, changing the relative attractiveness across the auction facilities, thinking about size, and thinking about price.  I think that will be very important to do.  It is very unlikely that the optimal path is going to be that there is a cliff—one day they are there, and the next day they aren’t.  So I completely agree with that. My own judgment is—but it may not be right, and it could change over time—that for the moment we want to have a clean, crisp signal.  Better to say that we are going to extend in the context of these broader initiatives to strengthen the system and not at the same moment alter their terms and relative attractiveness.  But we are going to have to think very carefully over the fall, conditions permitting, and well ahead of whatever the new date is, what the desirable exit strategy is in changing incentives around use. However, my basic sense is not now, not yet, partly because of the complexity of the signal you are sending and the difficulty of how it will be interpreted.  We have done all this stuff in part because we are trying to address a complicated mix of things around incentives, stigma, and that kind of thing.  It is hard for us to predict what the effect would be.  Its purpose is to wean, but to do it now would make the message a bit more complicated.  If the world is strong enough that you can wean them now, why are you extending.  So my basic sense is, absolutely, we are going to have to figure it out by the transition, not quite yet but well ahead of February 15 or whenever it is going to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The author agrees with the idea of eventually transitioning away from the mentioned policy, but disagrees with implementing it immediately. They believe it would be better to extend the policy in the context of broader initiatives before altering its terms and relative attractiveness. They argue that the complexities and potential interpretations of the signal being sent make it difficult to predict the effect of an immediate transition.


Passage number 289.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage provided does not contain any information or statement, therefore it is not possible to determine if there is any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 290.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I support Governor Warsh’s suggestion for raising the price.  It is hard for me to believe that confidence in any of these institutions depends materially on 100 basis points of the price.  It is the access, the funding, that they would be able to use to fund withdrawal or flight by somebody.  I think it sends the right signal that we view this as exceptional.  Conditions are certainly different than they were in March, when we designed and implemented it, and I think they are unlikely in the fall to be anywhere close to where they were on March 16.  You might disagree, and we could always change things between now and then.  But I like the signal of withdrawing the generosity just a tad.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses support for Governor Warsh's suggestion of raising the price. He also acknowledges that conditions have changed since the initial implementation and suggests that withdrawing some of the generosity is a positive signal. However, he also mentions the possibility of disagreement and the potential for things to change in the future. Overall, there is a sense of agreement and openness to discussion.


Passage number 291.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Remember that we are doing moral suasion as well.  I mean, we are not really allowing investment banks to use this as a profit center.  So I’m not quite sure what the marginal effect would be on incentives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the potential impact of their actions, rather than disagreeing with anyone else's perspective.


Passage number 292.
 MR. LACKER.  But this would also place less weight on moral suasion to discourage and would use the price system a bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not express any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states a potential alternative approach without any contradictory statements or conflicting perspectives.


Passage number 293.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It also might increase the stigma.  It is a very complicated calculation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "it is a very complicated calculation" suggests that the topic being discussed is complex rather than controversial or divisive.


Passage number 294.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  There are many things that I would love to do.  I would like to make them pay for it and say that we are not going to extend it unless they pay for it.  I would like to say that we are not going to extend it unless they pre-fund some liquidation facility for one of their little counterparties.  There are a million things that I think would be good to do from an incentive angle—but not at the same time that we are trying to maximize the chance that we get through this and have the flexibility to let monetary policy adjust to the changing amounts of risk on the other side of the tail.  So there are a million things I think it would be cool to do, and we will have to do them.  We will design them really in a clever way once we are at the point where that is optimal, but I just don’t think that’s now.  The risk is that it will undermine what we are trying to achieve with a fleeting “make us feel better” benefit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing the speaker's thoughts and preferences without presenting opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 295.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage only mentions the name "Governor Warsh" without providing any information or context. Without any additional information or statement to analyze, it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 296.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So just on behalf of the troublemaker caucus, [laughter] let me make a suggestion.  It doesn’t strike me as though the deltas between Vice Chairman Geithner’s formulation and what I proffered are that large.  That is, I think we collectively agree that we need, as part of an extension of the facility, to ensure that there is a suite of facilities and self-help efforts—tri-party repos, OTC derivatives, principles by you, and clarity on what the horizon looks like.  I guess the only question is, At the time that you solicit the notation vote and announce this—let’s say that is the second half of July—how comfortable are we at how that package looks to suggest that we are keeping options open and that the signal we are sending is not that this is a business that we want to stay in forever.  Maybe in that context we will see what kind of progress we are making in truth on some of those infrastructure improvements and in the narrative, so that we can revisit—I think maybe with some guidance from Brian, Bill, and the staff—what the incremental benefits are of a modest change to the PDCF in that context.  By the second half of July, we might find that we are much more informed so as to weigh the benefits and costs of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is making a suggestion and expressing agreement with Vice Chairman Geithner's formulation. They are discussing the details of how to extend a facility and considering the potential benefits and costs.


Passage number 297.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Bill Dudley, did you have a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any specific information or context about Bill Dudley or his comment, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 298.
 MR. DUDLEY.  The real issue may be that the PDCF borrowing may be de minimis.  In that environment, it’s not really clear what raising the price really means.  It might even be confusing to people if you raise the price at the time the borrowing was de minimis.  So I think that is just one consideration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is presenting a viewpoint and discussing a possible confusion that may arise.
