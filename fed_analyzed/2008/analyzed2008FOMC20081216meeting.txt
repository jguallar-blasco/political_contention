Passage number 1.
 Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on December 15-16, 2008 December 15, 2008—Afternoon Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  We welcome Chris Cumming, who is sitting in for New York.  As you know, under the extraordinary circumstances we added an extra day to the meeting.  The purpose of the meeting taking place today is to discuss the zero lower bound and related policy and governance issues, and I hope that the discussion today will set up our policy decision for tomorrow. Just for preview purposes, the program today will start with Bill Dudley and Q&A.  We’ll then have a staff presentation on the zero lower bound and alternative policies.  We’ll have a go-round on those issues, including nontraditional policies and communications associated with it and so on.  Let me just mention that on the agenda for tomorrow, after the policy decision, we have the subcommittee’s report on long-run projections and the quarterly projections.  We put that there to save time and to make sure that we met our deadlines; but obviously there’s some linkage between that and the discussion today, and if anyone wants to bring that up today, please feel free to do so.  Finally, if we’re very efficient—as I hope we will be—I’d like to get to the staff economic briefing at the end of today, if possible—if not, not—and then there’s dinner afterwards.  So without further ado, let me turn to Bill Dudley.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple introduction to the agenda and plans for the meeting.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 2.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  There was a sharp decline in the spike in the fails recently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The statement suggests a sharp decline in the spike in the fails, indicating a decrease or disagreement with the previous pattern or trend. However, the passage does not provide further information or context to understand the nature of the contention or disagreement.


Passage number 3.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.  There are two potential explanations, and it’s really hard to sort out what’s driving it.  One is just that trading volumes have come down, and as trading volumes have come down, fails have come down.  So that’s part of it.  It’s just tied to trading volume.  The second explanation is that the Treasury Market Practices Group published a best practices report basically arguing that a penalty rate should be put on fails, and it is going to design a road map to show how that might be implemented in practice.  It may be that, given that publication, people who before might have been more cavalier about shorting Treasury securities at very low interest rates are now somewhat less inclined to do so just because of the moral suasion of that report that it is not a good thing to do.  So it is some combination of those two, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker presents two potential explanations for a phenomenon and discusses how they may be contributing factors.


Passage number 4.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions for Bill.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.    This passage is simply a polite thank you message and a request for questions for Bill Hoenig. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 5.
 MR. HOENIG.  Bill, in your discussion on exhibit 13 and around the idea that a number of resets are coming for mortgages—the earlier seven-year ARMs and so forth—and as you also look forward to where mortgage rates are, why are you anticipating trouble with the ability to refinance, given the outlook for mortgages rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning why the other person is anticipating trouble with the ability to refinance, indicating a difference in opinion or perspective.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 6.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think you have to distinguish between conforming mortgage markets and everything else.  The conforming mortgage market is doing fine.  Some spreads are a little wider than they have been historically, but our actions seem to have been pretty successful in bringing those spreads in a bit.  So the conforming mortgage market rate is fine.  The problem is in commercial-mortgage-backed securities and nonconforming mortgages.  The appetite to provide financing there is very, very much impaired, especially in the commercial mortgage market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: There is disagreement in the passage as Mr. Dudley argues that the conforming mortgage market is doing fine while the commercial-mortgage-backed securities and nonconforming mortgages are facing problems.


Passage number 7.
 MR. HOENIG.  Right.  Okay.  That clarifies.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Hoenig is expressing gratitude for the clarification.


Passage number 8.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the given passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 9.
 MR. FISHER.  Bill, has the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program interfered with or added to the confusion in the purchase and sales of fed funds, or has our excluding sales under one month changed the picture.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question seeking information about the impact of the FDIC's temporary liquidity guarantee program on the purchase and sales of fed funds.


Passage number 10.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t think it has created much confusion.  The biggest confusion is who is guaranteed and who is not and which instruments are guaranteed and which instruments are not.  I think people will have trouble sorting that out.  Most of the issuance has been long term—three years.  People say, “Well, if I’m paying 75 basis points, let me get the most value for that.”  So there hasn’t really been much channel conflict with the very short end, and I think that the fact that one month and in is not covered also has reduced that potential channel conflict.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is primarily providing information and stating personal opinions.


Passage number 11.
 MR. FISHER.  Is that pretty well understood in the marketplace.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Is that pretty well understood in the marketplace" is a question seeking clarification, not expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 12.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their opinion without mentioning any conflicting views.


Passage number 13.
 MR. FISHER.  Then speaking of guarantees, I have just one more question, if I may, Mr. Chairman.  In chart 14, are these net of credits that might have some kind of government guarantee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and seeking clarification.


Passage number 14.
 MR. DUDLEY.  This is total.  In fact, when you look at the issuance of investment-grade corporate debt recently, there’s quite a bit of it, but most of it is the guaranteed stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the issuance of investment-grade corporate debt.


Passage number 15.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 16.
 MR. DUDLEY.  So excluding the guaranteed stuff, the issuance volumes do not look as robust as the aggregate number suggests because so much of that is the guaranteed stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker is suggesting that the issuance volumes are not as impressive as they appear to be because a significant portion of it is "guaranteed stuff." This implies that there may be a disagreement or discrepancy in how the numbers are being presented or interpreted.


Passage number 17.
 MR. FISHER.  So for 2009.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a statement by Mr. Fisher.


Passage number 18.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t have the number off the top of my head.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement made by Mr. Dudley without any opposition or conflict from others.


Passage number 19.
 MR. FISHER.  It’s not this total.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. It is a simple statement of fact by Mr. Fisher.


Passage number 20.
 MR. DUDLEY.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple response by Mr. Dudley with no conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints expressed.


Passage number 21.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 22.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Any other questions" is simply a request for additional inquiries. The mention of President Bullard does not indicate disagreement either.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 23.
 MR. BULLARD.  At the beginning of your comments, you said that you expected further big mark-to-market losses.  Do you mean over and above what markets anticipate now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard questions the speaker's statement about expecting additional losses beyond what the markets already anticipate.


Passage number 24.
 MR. DUDLEY.  No.  I mean that in the fourth quarter they will reflect the decline that occurred from August 30 to November 30 for the investment banks.  September 30 to December 30 just hasn’t been yet recorded on their balance sheet.  They haven’t announced it yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 25.
 MR. BULLARD.  You cited that Goldman number of $2 billion, but that’s been widely reported.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply referencing a widely reported number without expressing any disagreement or contrary opinion.


Passage number 26.
 MR. DUDLEY.  That has been widely reported.  Morgan Stanley is also going to report this week, and it is highly likely they will have similar losses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states a fact that Morgan Stanley is going to report their financial results, and it speculates that the company will likely have similar losses. There is no indication of disagreement or contention presented in the passage.


Passage number 27.
 MR. BULLARD.  Then I just want to understand—on exhibit 2 you said something about a fully discounted default rate last seen in the Great Depression.  What did you mean by that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is simply seeking clarification and understanding regarding a statement made about a fully discounted default rate last seen in the Great Depression.


Passage number 28.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, if you basically take that 21 percent and compare it with the default rates in the Great Depression and write down some numbers for recoveries, if you had a default rate equal to the Great Depression default rate and you had a 20 percent recovery, you’d actually do pretty well owning high-yield debt at these levels right now.  So the level of yields fully discounts horrific default rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting a hypothetical scenario to show that owning high-yield debt at current levels could still be advantageous, given certain conditions. There is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement being presented.


Passage number 29.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  In fairness, these are junk bonds.  These are low-rated companies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply conveys that the bonds being referred to are junk bonds and that the companies associated with them have low ratings.


Passage number 30.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, yes.  It is possible that we could have default rates greater than those of the Great Depression.  I’m just saying that these levels discount that kind of outcome.  Obviously, the high-yield debt market today is different from general default rates.  Yeah, I think that’s a fair point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It includes an agreement or acknowledgement of a fair point made by MR. DUDLEY.


Passage number 31.
 MR. BULLARD.  Do we know.  Was there something like a junk market in the Great Depression that we can compare this with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question about the existence of a junk market during the Great Depression.


Passage number 32.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, there were certain leveraged utility companies that you could argue were pretty junky.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that there were leveraged utility companies that could be argued as being of low quality or "junky."


Passage number 33.
 MR. FISHER.  Corporate grade became junk in the Great Depression.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement simply provides a factual statement about the corporate grade becoming junk during the Great Depression. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 34.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Michael Milken hadn’t been born yet.  [Laughter]  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It merely states a fact and elicits laughter, likely due to the notion of someone not being born yet.


Passage number 35.
 MR. LACKER.  That’s a calculation that embeds risk neutrality into the extrapolation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 36.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, you could solve for the risk premium that was left over, and we did a back-of-the-envelope calculation in New York on that.  It was an excess return of about 600 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents the calculation and does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or opposing opinions.


Passage number 37.
   MR. LACKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information given in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 38.
  Doesn’t that depend on the assumption about the correlation between— MR. DUDLEY.  Look.  This is back of the envelope.  Obviously, you’d have to dig down pretty deeply to try to separate what’s the default rate and what’s the risk premium.  But the point here is that the market is discounting very adverse outcomes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that more analysis is needed to separate the default rate from the risk premium, but agrees with the point that the market is currently discounting very adverse outcomes.


Passage number 39.
 MR. BULLARD.  I just want to follow up on that.  Would you say that that represents a tremendous amount of pessimism out there, or are you saying that you think we’re going to get default rates like the Great Depression.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking for clarification or an opinion on whether the mentioned scenario represents a high level of pessimism or if it is expected to result in default rates similar to those of the Great Depression.


Passage number 40.
 MR. DUDLEY.  No, I think it’s some combination.  I don’t think you can really separate how much of it is default rate versus how much of it is risk premium.  The point is that there’s probably a considerable amount of both.  Clearly the risk premiums are high because we see risk premiums on safe assets being very, very high.  The classic example is the student loan, which is 97 percent guaranteed by the federal government, trading at LIBOR plus 350 or LIBOR plus 400.  That’s probably a pretty good measure of risk premium—that’s your underlying risk premium on all assets, maybe a few hundred basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Dudley explaining his opinion on the combination of default rate and risk premium in determining the overall risk of assets.


Passage number 41.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker has a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply states that President Lacker has a two-hander, without any conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints being presented.


Passage number 42.
 MR. LACKER.  First, about the risk premium, it’s either a lot of pessimism or a lot of correlation between defaults and bad states of the world and essentially low growth.  The second thing, I took a look at the student-loan-asset-backed securities that you talked about—FFELP.  I think you have a chart here.  It turns out that the trusts are guaranteed a rate of return equal to the commercial paper rate, and any excess over that they have to return to the Department of Education.  They get a payment if the return is below that.  Your coupon is 200 points above LIBOR, and LIBOR is trading a bit above commercial paper rates, right.  So there’s a negative spread built into the trust documents.  They’re paying 300 basis points more than they’re earning on the trust.  So a little extra premium seems pretty reasonable.  Is my understanding of that security correct, Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and seeking confirmation of their understanding of the topic discussed.


Passage number 43.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think what you’re describing is the perspective from the issuer of the obligation.  The issuer of the obligation has a problem because on one side they get commercial paper and on the other side they get LIBOR, and so they have a mismatch.  They have essentially a basis risk.  But about where securities are trading in the market or what end-investors can invest in the securities—I think you’re referring more to the issuers of the securities, and the chart I showed is what investors in the AAA tranches get.  So I think it’s a slightly different thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Dudley is simply clarifying and explaining a different perspective or aspect of the topic being discussed.


Passage number 44.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, wouldn’t investors want to discount or take into account the fact that the trust, which is their only source of payment, is earning about 300 basis points less than the coupon.  Wouldn’t that show up in a higher premium on what the investor is willing to pay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is posing a hypothetical question and seeking clarification on whether investors would consider the discrepancy in earnings between the trust and the coupon when determining the premium they are willing to pay.


Passage number 45.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t see it that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 46.
 MR. WILCOX.  President Lacker, it’s a complicated security, but it’s wrapped by a guarantee that ultimately the Department of Education will make good on to the tune of 97 cents on the dollar.  There’s one little detail that is causing another piece of friction in the market, and that is that, if the servicer doesn’t perform on the loan, then the Department of Education has the right to not make good on the guarantee.  But other than that, it’s about 97 percent guaranteed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The passage mentions that there is a "little detail" causing friction in the market, which suggests that there is disagreement or contention about this particular aspect of the guarantee. Specifically, the provision that allows the Department of Education to not make good on the guarantee if the servicer doesn't perform on the loan is causing disagreement.


Passage number 47.
 MR. DUDLEY.  We think they’re pretty safe—not perfectly safe, but pretty safe.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "We think they're pretty safe" is a subjective opinion without any evident disagreement or contention.


Passage number 48.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only shows agreement between individuals as Mr. Lacker responds with "Okay."


Passage number 49.
 MR. WILCOX.  Apparently the ability of the Department of Education not to make good on the guarantee is very rarely exercised.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of fact and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 50.
 MR. LACKER.  But the Department of Education doesn’t guarantee LIBOR plus a 200 basis point coupon.  It guarantees the commercial paper rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is stating a fact about the Department of Education's guarantee.


Passage number 51.
 MR. WILCOX.  I believe Bill’s point is that it guarantees a return to the investor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough context to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Wilcox's understanding of Bill's point without any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 52.
 MR. LACKER.  That still doesn’t seem that irrationally priced.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing appreciation or agreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 53.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Other questions for Bill.  If not, we need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states that if there are no other questions for Bill, a motion to ratify domestic open market operations is needed.


Passage number 54.
 MR. KOHN.  I so move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kohn is simply stating his intention to move something without any opposing views or contradictory statements being mentioned.


Passage number 55.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any objections.  All right.  Thank you.  Let’s turn now to Brian, and we’ll have a staff presentation on the zero lower bound.  I’m being reminded that this is a joint Board–FOMC meeting.  I’m reconvening a Board meeting that began this morning.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker seems to be providing information and acknowledgements without any objection or dispute.


Passage number 56.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As the Committee requested at your last meeting, the staff has provided background for your discussion today of issues related to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.  Ten days ago, we sent you 21 notes covering lessons from the U.S. and Japanese experiences in disinflationary or deflationary environments; the possible costs to financial markets and institutions of very low interest rates; the potential benefits of further rate reductions; and the advantages and disadvantages of nonstandard approaches to providing macroeconomic stimulus that could be employed when the federal funds rate cannot be reduced further.  Numerous staff members contributed to these notes—too many to recognize individually right now.  But I would nevertheless like to thank them collectively for their intensive efforts on this project when many were already quite busy with other important assignments.  Steve Meyer will now summarize the key conclusions from the staff work, and then I will review the suggested questions for discussion that we sent to you last week.  Steve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about the background and preparations for a discussion on issues related to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.


Passage number 57.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I won’t try to respond, but I do want to ask you what your interpretation of the Japanese experience is.  They had enormous increases in the base, no increase in M1, and no inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 58.
  MR. LACKER.  First, let me say that there are models and sets of policy rules under which in the short run there is an irrelevance proposition, a kind of Modigliani–Miller theorem, about exchanges of monetary assets for short-term liquid securities that are virtually perfect substitutes and at the zero lower bound are definitely perfect substitutes.  So that is definitely true.  The point I made about the base in the long run is true as well.  It has to do with eliminating certain possible conjectures that the public might make about our willingness to tolerate deflation.  In the Japanese case, they were widely known to be quite eager to lift interest rates.  It was known that they viewed the problems in the banking sector as exacerbated by low interest rates.  They thought that raising real interest rates would provide more discipline and force more restructuring in the banking system.  So they continually had to fight to keep the long end of the yield curve down.  I don’t view that experience as providing the best evidence about what a firm commitment to preventing deflation could be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of a statement and explanation of certain propositions and observations.


Passage number 59.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, you had a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a neutral observation about President Fisher having a two-hander. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 60.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.  I just want to ask a question—again acknowledging that I am the least well educated on this subject matter and not as erudite in my understanding.  So this is a tutorial question.  What we have been doing is implicitly acknowledging that standard monetary tools are not as effective as they could be because of the financial frictions that we have encountered in the marketplace.  So we have been targeting dealing with those financial frictions.  My question, President Lacker, is just from an educational standpoint:  Do we know how much monetary base or balance sheet expansion would be needed to bring credit spreads back into normal order or to deal with these financial frictions.  If we are going to target the monetary base, I worry about the operational consequences of doing so, since it seems to me that is an open-ended question.  That is my question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 61.
 MR. LACKER.  That is a very good question.  We don’t have any models to draw on because we don’t have any data that would allow us to uncover a structural relationship between spreads and the quantity of the base.  In any event, even were we to focus solely on our primary objectives for growth and inflation, I think we would have trouble there.  I think we would have a great deal of difficulty figuring out a quantitative relationship between the monetary base at the zero bound and our objectives.  But we started the way we usually do things—without a serious quantitative understanding of the relationship between the funds rate and growth and inflation, and we groped and groped and found our way.  We are going to grope and try to find our way in this new regime, and we are going to have to think hard about it and make some guesses—by trial and error—just the way we learned how to do funds rate targeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that there is a lack of data and models to understand the relationship between spreads and the quantity of the base, as well as the relationship between the monetary base and their objectives for growth and inflation. The speaker also mentions that they have previously operated without a strong quantitative understanding and had to rely on trial and error. There is no indication of disagreement or differing viewpoints.


Passage number 62.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions President Plosser without providing any information about his actions, statements, or positions. Therefore, it does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 63.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude and a statement of the title "President Yellen."


Passage number 64.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone to President Bullard.


Passage number 65.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Why don’t we take fifteen minutes for coffee and then come back and continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It suggests taking a break for coffee and then continuing with whatever activity was happening before.


Passage number 66.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig, whenever you are ready.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a request for President Hoenig to begin whenever they are ready.


Passage number 67.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement simply expresses gratitude and addresses President Lockhart. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 68.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple thank you message from President Evans.


Passage number 69.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It only expresses gratitude toward someone named Governor Kohn.


Passage number 70.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are you in charge of drafting it.  [Laughter]  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  


Passage number 71.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me make some comments, first about nonstandard policies, then about communication, and finally a bit about the balance sheet, governance, and so forth.  With regard to the nonstandard policies, Bill Dudley’s charts 24 and 25 showing the spreads narrowing with intervention and spreads tending to widen elsewhere seem to make a pretty compelling starting point at least, not only for the value of the programs in place but perhaps for considering additional ones.  I guess I am kind of wary about that at this point.  A sentence in one of the staff papers that pertains to this—let me also compliment the staff for the quality and the volume of what they have produced here—caught my attention:  “It is difficult to provide specific recommendations for further intervention at this time, in part because facilities that are most obviously valuable to address current conditions have already been put in place or are in train.”  That is one concern I have—that we may be heading toward diminishing returns.  In addition, as I think somebody has already observed, there is a possibility that, if we carry this too far, we interfere with what would otherwise be normal and healthy market adjustments.  Some of that is going to have to work its way through.  Finally, one thing from the Japanese experience is the so-called preservation of zombies, which, whatever you might say about its short-run value, clearly wasn’t of value to the long-run health of the economy.  So my preference as far as nonstandard tools would be to emphasize purchases of longer-term Treasuries and of GSEs and mortgage-backed securities.  At least at this point, that is where I would want to put my emphasis. With regard to communication, as I think President Evans said, reiterating our longer-run objectives, indicating—given conditions as we perceive and expect them—that the funds rate is likely to remain low for a considerable period of time or, alternatively, that reserve provision is going to remain generous, however we want to say it, is acceptable.  There could be some value, if we can get there, in specifying an inflation target, and certainly the effort to provide longer-term steady-state forecasts will work in that direction.  I think we need to be a little careful, though, as Governor Kohn suggested, to think through a variety of issues that are associated with this.  I can even imagine that, even if we were to agree on an inflation target and even if the Congress had no objection, it might be a bit of a distraction at this point and there could be a lot of debate external to the System whether it is the right target and why or why not, and so on and so forth.  Of course, that is not our principal concern at the moment. With regard to the balance sheet and governance issues, I certainly can get comfortable with the consultative, collaborative approach you described.  There might be some value from a credibility point of view—I put this more as a question than a conclusion—in trying to specify some numerical range for the base, reserves, or something in that the public could monitor whether in fact we are doing what we say we are doing.  To the extent that we are concerned about the possibility of excessive disinflation or of deflation, this would be a way for the public not only to take our word for it but also to monitor that in fact we were conducting policy in a way consistent with that.  President Lacker, in his discussion, indicated that emphasizing the base was a way to emphasize, at least in the longer run, that we weren’t intending to let inflation get too low.  I put this as a question—this could be a way of helping credibility because the public could monitor it.  Thank you.

Passage number 72.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage provided, as there is no accompanying text or context mentioning President Rosengren.


Passage number 73.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I would also like to join the chorus of people thanking the staff, in particular the staff members who were working on the memos on Japan.  Having done some work on Japan myself, I know that getting the institutional details right is far from easy, particularly when you are not a native speaker.  So I much appreciated the work in that area. The probability of a severe economic downturn accompanied by deflation is too high, and the effective fed funds rate is already very close to zero.  This combination calls for aggressive, nontraditional policies.  My reading of the parallel Japanese experience highlights two general principles.  The first is one that President Stern highlighted.  There is a macroeconomic impact from what we do in bank supervision.  Banking problems should be addressed expeditiously, with realistic write-downs of problem assets and recapitalization of problem banks.  In particular, we should prevent perverse incentives where problem borrowers are supported while healthier borrowers are starved for credit as banks try to satisfy balance sheet constraints and avoid further loss recognition.  Second, monetary and macroeconomic policies to address financial dislocations should be proactive and forceful rather than released gradually over an extended period of time.  In the context of the questions that we have been asked to address, I’d like to encourage us to take three actions. First, I would explicitly state that the Committee seeks to achieve a core PCE inflation rate of 2 percent in the medium term.  For the second time this decade we are approaching the zero nominal interest rate bound.  Setting too low an inflation target threatens to place us in our current predicament too often.  In contrast, by setting an explicit target at 2 percent, we will indicate our resolve to take nontraditional policies necessary to achieve that goal.  Because the inflation target adopted under the current circumstances would be designed to raise inflation expectations and stimulate the economy, this may be a particularly propitious time to adopt such an explicit target.  A 2 percent target would also be consistent with our own revealed preference as the core PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.94 percent, very close to 2 percent, over the past ten years. Second, during the past recession, 30-year conventional mortgage rates reached 5¼ percent.  The current rate has been hovering at 5½ percent and has reached that level only since we announced our program to purchase $600 billion in GSE debt and mortgage-backed securities.  The housing sector remains the epicenter of our problems.  Given the current outlook, I would suggest using facilities to move toward an interest rate target, for example, by reducing by 100 basis points from current levels the conventional 30-year mortgage rate.  Lowering the 30-year conventional mortgage rate would reduce the cost of purchasing new homes, encourage refinancing by those with sufficiently high credit scores and equity in their homes, and support fiscal policies that are targeted at more-troubled homebuyers.  It would help troubled and healthy homeowners, stimulate the most distressed area of our economy, and help financial institutions exposed to problems in housing.  Such a target would be understandable to the general public, and actions already taken have made some progress in this area and serve as an example.  I would focus on the mortgage rates rather than the Treasury yield curve because lower Treasury rates seem to be having little effect on rates paid by households and businesses, and the desire to avoid credit risk has already brought 10-year Treasury rates to lows not seen in most recent recessions. Third, our facilities for short-term credit have been successful.  Short-term commercial paper rates have fallen as a result of our programs, as was highlighted by Bill Dudley, and the rollover risk at the end of the year has been mitigated by the commercial paper program.  Increasingly, however, I have been hearing complaints about banks pulling lines of credit when they are up for renewal primarily because the banks are facing balance sheet issues.  One possible remedy might be to extend our commercial paper facility to highly rated firms for longer maturities than are covered by the commercial paper market.  All three suggestions would be easily communicated and understood by the public, would address directly the areas of the economy in which financing has become particularly difficult, and would highlight our resolve to avoid a deflationary economy, such as Japan experienced for over a decade. I would just end with the note that I agree with the Governor Kohn on the monetary base for two reasons.  The first is that I do not think our facilities have been particularly well designed to set a quantitative target.  Many of the facilities are open ended.  Go through the following thought experiment.  Suppose a money market fund once again breaks the buck.  The AMLF will probably go up $150 billion or $200 billion.  I would expect the commercial paper facility to go up.  I would expect that most of the bank facilities would also go up.  If we were limited by a quantitative target at the very time that we actually want those facilities to be expanding, we would be constrained.  I do not think that is a good idea in the current situation.  The second reason comes from my reading of what happened in Japan, and this goes to some of the remarks that the Chairman made.  The monetary base in Japan did expand very rapidly.  When banks are capital constrained, expanding reserves very rapidly does not translate into an expansion of the broader balance sheet.  So we could very easily see a situation in the United States in which banks continue to be capital constrained for some time.  Despite increasing the monetary base, we might not see an expansion in terms of other assets.  That is exactly why I agree with the Chairman that we should be focused on the asset, not the liability, side of the balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement with previous statements and offering suggestions for action.


Passage number 74.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named President Pianalto.


Passage number 75.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also want to start by thanking the staff for the excellent background materials they provided.  While I certainly wish we were not in this circumstance, I do think that this is a critical conversation for us to be having at this meeting, and the background materials were extremely helpful.  I am going to proceed directly to the questions that Brian provided as I believe they cover the major issues well.  I have some general answers to the questions, but I think that we are going to be learning a lot in the process of implementing policies into ever more uncharted waters. On the question of whether the Committee should quickly move the target fed funds rate toward the zero bound or get there more gradually, I strongly support moving quickly.  I agree with the memos that the Japanese experience points to the value of moving aggressively.  Also, we have already moved beyond the targeted fed funds rate as many have commented, and so we are merely confirming a reality. On the questions pertaining to the costs to financial markets or institutions and the limits to our rate reduction, I think the notes covered very well the costs to some money market funds.  Bankers in my District have also expressed concerns about additional margin squeezing that they will face with a lower fed funds rate.  So, yes, there are significant costs to financial markets and institutions.  However, I believe that the current environment and our need to allow the fed funds rate to trade close to zero trumps these costs, and in my view a 25 basis point fed funds rate is an appropriate minimum. Regarding the question about the communication strategy, I think another lesson that we have learned from the Japanese experience is the role of effective communication and the role of anchoring inflation expectations.  So I do see the benefit in communicating that the Federal Reserve intends to hold the target fed funds rate at a very low level until specified conditions are obtained, and that the Committee sees a sizable risk that inflation in the coming quarters could be appreciably lower than is consistent with price stability.  I also see that there may be some value to communicating that our policies might result in a temporarily higher inflation rate in the future, both to indicate this possibility and to signal a willingness to make sure that the risk of deflation dissipates before we alter our course.  Although we have not adopted a formal inflation target, I do believe that the release of our longer-term projections as suggested by the Subcommittee on Communications will be helpful in managing inflation expectations. Moving to questions 4 and 5 regarding nonstandard policy tools, my own preference is for a mixed strategy—that is, some direct Treasury and agency purchases and some expansion of our private asset purchases using the TALF.  I support your view, Mr. Chairman, that we should keep our focus on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet.  I think we should consider increasing the purchase of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities beyond the levels that we have already announced.  I also see advantages in initiating large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities.  These actions should help to lower interest rates across a broad spectrum of longer-term assets.  As we have talked about, direct purchases also fit more naturally into the FOMC’s governance structure, whereas the TALF-like approach is more awkward to fit into the FOMC’s purview.  As some have commented, direct purchases might expose our System Open Market Account to some capital losses, but that seems an acceptable risk for monetary policy in such a challenging environment. I do think that the focus of our FOMC meetings next year should be on evaluating and adjusting the composition and size of our purchase of securities in response to changing economic conditions so that the directive need not build in explicit conditioning on market and economic circumstances.  Further expansion of our credit backstop facilities under section 13(3) is also likely to be beneficial in current circumstances.  I think the CPFF has been a helpful addition to our facilities, and I am hopeful that the TALF will be equally effective.  So, in summary, I favor applying all of these approaches and remaining flexible.  I also believe that a clear starting point on how the Committee would formulate its directive would be to direct the Desk to purchase specific quantities of assets.  As a formal matter, we might need to include “up to” in our directive language, but we should anticipate that the Desk would be successful in meeting that objective.  I think that the uncertainty surrounding the effects of our actions makes longer-term interest rates or spreads too unreliable to be communicated as targets. Finally, on the question of effectively communicating nonstandard policy tools, I liked the language in some of the Bluebook alternatives for our policy options.  However, because of the historic nature of implementing nonstandard policy tools, I think that a good communication plan should also include a formal press conference or a speech in which, Mr. Chairman, you announce the changes.  That would serve to emphasize the change in our procedure and eliminate some of the uncertainties about the role of the fed funds rate target.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Pianalto provides her opinions and preferences on various topics, but does not indicate disagreement with any other speaker or participant.


Passage number 76.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President Cumming.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Thank you" and the mention of the First Vice President Cumming do not indicate any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 77.
 MS. CUMMING.  Thank you.  Again, I’d also like to thank the staff for the excellent notes.  It’s useful to start out with our near-term goals, as most of us have done, to provide stimulus and support for the economic recovery and to prevent too large a fall in inflation.  The root problems, I think, are worth focusing on for a second:  insufficient global demand, hurdles to economic activity from a severely impaired financial system, and as I’ll report tomorrow, behavior that is influenced by confusion and fear among businesses and households that are tending to reinforce the downward trend of the economy. That environment, I think, gives us some goalposts to look for in terms of framing the strategy.  I find very appealing Marvin Goodfriend’s characterization of the duality of the central bank’s policy.  We have a monetary and what he calls a credit policy at the same time.  In normal times setting the fed funds rate influences financial conditions, especially credit markets, in a fairly predictable manner, and this Committee from time to time has discussed where overnight rates and financial conditions have diverged.  In these times, we’re observing a major disconnect between overnight rates and financial conditions that is reflected in huge spreads but also in a lack of transactions and in nonprice rationing in markets. So coming back to the question of what some of our goals are:  To address the problems that we see, communication is really the essential element, and we should be aiming for maximum impact in whatever actions we take and also in our communications.  I think, therefore, that we should bring rates down now as far as we think we can take them.  But the more important decision is articulating what we are going to do going forward, why we are doing it, how long we are planning to do it, and under what conditions we would stop doing it.  Some of the confusion that is out there about what the Federal Reserve has been doing reflects the fact that our operations really cover two very different kinds of things.  On one side we are expanding liquidity and supporting the recovery of financial markets by the CPFF, the MBS purchases, and the upcoming TALF.  In other facilities we are preventing catastrophic market outcomes through asset disposition, such as the Bear Stearns transaction, AIG, and the recent transaction we’ve had with Citi.  In addition, there are a lot of technicalities and legalities to these facilities that make it hard for the general public to understand what we are doing.  So more fundamentally we need to communicate what we want to accomplish, and that importantly involves our commitment to price stability, as many have said here in the sense of keeping prices in the medium term rising in line with our 1½ to 2 percent preference, and our commitment to a resumption of sustainable economic activity. When I turn to look at what kind of facilities we should be thinking about going forward, once interest rates are down to their minimum level, there are really a few things that I would highlight.  First, in many ways we could influence expectations about short-term policy rates through our long-term debt purchases, as many have said.  In particular, when we try to lean against expectations expressed in the yield curve that rates are going to rise soon, and we’re seeing some of that today, we can intervene in markets that directly affect major elements of aggregate demand, and I would see that as a very important role of our agency MBS program and also the CPFF to address where firms are really being starved of working capital.  Because of its structure, the TALF provides a very broad umbrella under which we could do intervention, again, where we see credit markets failing and economic activity impeded by the lack of finance of a wide variety.  I think that we should look at the CPFF and the TALF more as backstop facilities that provide the credit we need but also build in a kind of exit strategy so that, when spreads come down, there is an opportunity for the market basically to tell us, “You can wind this down now.” We need to communicate the criteria by which we are choosing these markets.  We have mentioned these three big market segments.  I think simpler is much better than having something that’s very complicated or having many, many facilities.  As part of this, the crucial thing is to provide to the marketplace some kind of conditional commitment.  If we don’t feel that we’re ready yet for the inflation target, certainly between this meeting and the next we really need to think about what kind of conditional commitment we could make—what conditions in the marketplace would lead us to feel that our work was largely done. I would also note, though, that the historical notes made the excellent point that the risk is that we withdraw stimulus too quickly—that we believe the patient is healing when, in fact, the patient is merely stabilized.  So our commitment must be both ambitious in its level and compelling as it is communicated to the public.  I think we need to return to the expository approach that the Fed and then-Governor Bernanke took during 2002 and 2003, by which we carefully laid out the elements, the foundation, and the expected outcomes of our approach in that period.  As valuable as it was in 2002-03, it is even more valuable today, when confusion and anxiety are shaping behaviors that will amplify the downward forces in the economy.  I also endorse the recommendation that many have made to think about a press conference.  The need for reassuring communication to the public is, I think, very great. I would add two more thoughts.  Of course, it is really crucial that we are coordinating our policy with Treasury, and there are many ways in which we do that today—certainly, we need coordination of fiscal and monetary policy.  I frankly would like to see more of our asset-disposition activities taken on by the U.S. government so that it would be easier for us to describe the facilities that we have as supporting the market and restoring market functioning.  I also believe, as I’m sure that many of you do, that we will probably need some kind of agreement with the Treasury vis-à-vis our exit strategy.  I particularly underline the real possibility, which several have mentioned here, that we may want to raise interest rates well before the markets are really fully healed or fully sustainable by themselves.  We’ll need to be able to negotiate that in the sense of both the path we take and the understanding we have with the fiscal authorities. Then just to conclude here, I also very much want to endorse the point that President Rosengren made about needing to fix the banking system and doing it sooner rather than later.  There really is no ability for the economy to function without a strong banking system.  Certainly I believe that you are hearing, as I am, of many instances in which the rationing that is going on through the banking system right now is reaching a destructive potential.  In that kind of world, I think we need to turn our attention to that.  The Federal Reserve is one of the most important supervisors in our country and in the world, and I think we can do a lot to lead to the very tough actions that need to be taken there.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of the speaker expressing their opinion and endorsing various recommendations made by others.


Passage number 78.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Several people have mentioned press conferences.  I should say that we’re looking very carefully at the idea of doing quarterly press conferences with the release of the projections, along the lines of the Bank of England.  If we decide to do that—and input from the Committee is welcome—the first one would be in February.  It would coincide in this case with the Humphrey-Hawkins additional presentation.  I have a speech at the London School of Economics in mid-January in which I will be able to lay out a lot of these issues.  I don’t know if that’s soon enough, but I don’t know whether we think we should do more communication or not.  That’s something we can talk about tomorrow perhaps, but I did want you to know that we are looking at the quarterly press conference model.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 79.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m in awe of a presentation that has Rube Goldberg, the Black Death, “Bennie and the Jets,” and full frontal view all in it.  [Laughter]  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage doesn't mention any conflicting opinions or opposing views. It simply expresses admiration or amazement towards a presentation that includes various elements.


Passage number 80.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 81.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage because it only mentions Governor Duke without any additional information or context to suggest any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 82.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Thank you all.  I actually would like to try to distill some impressions from our discussion and, going even a step further, maybe draw some very tentative conclusions for the statement and decision tomorrow.  I do that in the spirit of fairness because tomorrow you have a chance to rebut what I say now.  So let me just draw some tentative conclusions, and if you disagree or if there are multiple options, perhaps you can respond in our go-rounds tomorrow. First, with respect to the level of the fed funds rate, I think generally speaking people want to be aggressive.  They recognize the difficulty, the severity, of the situation.  Some were somewhat fatalistic, saying, well, we can’t really keep the rate much above zero anyway, so it’s somewhat of a moot question.  With that said, Governor Duke was just the last of a number of people who did point out that there are various institutional, market, and other considerations that would suggest trying to keep the rate above zero if possible, although she had a very interesting alternative, which is just not to have a target, which might be helpful in at least a few contexts.  Let me ask Bill about feasibility here.  Suppose for the sake of argument that we had a range of 25 to 50 and we set the interest rate on reserves at 50.  Would that be feasible.  Could that work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the speaker's own thoughts and reflections on the discussion, and their intention to draw tentative conclusions. There is no indication of conflicting views or arguments between the speaker and others in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 83.
 MR. DUDLEY.  It might work eventually, but right now I would guess the spread between the effective funds rate and the target would be bigger than that.  We’re sort of running that experiment right now.  The market consensus is that the Fed is going to reduce the target 50 basis points at this meeting.  That’s incorporated in the current federal funds rate trading because it’s the lowest interest on excess reserves during the two-week maintenance period.  We’re trading in a range of about 10 to 15 basis points.  We don’t have that much information, but right now that spread is probably 35 to 40 basis points.  So I think we probably couldn’t do what you said.  If we worked on it—you know, took the GSEs and made it so that they couldn’t sell fed funds and did a few other things—maybe we could get that spread down to 25 basis points over time.  Brian, do you have anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Dudley, argues that the spread between the effective funds rate and the target would be bigger than what another person suggested. He believes that the current spread is around 35 to 40 basis points and suggests that it would be difficult to get it down to 25 basis points over time.


Passage number 84.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Madigan expresses his agreement, indicating that there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 85.
 [Meeting recessed] December 15, 2008—Morning Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  Let’s start off today with the economic outlook.  Dan, will you be taking the lead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a statement about starting off the day with an economic outlook and someone named Dan taking the lead.


Passage number 86.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Remind me what your anticipation of the current account deficit is for next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward request for information.


Passage number 87.
 MR. AHMED.  I think the deficit goes down to about 3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement simply states a belief about the deficit going down to about 3 percent. There is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 88.
 MR. SHEETS.  Yes.  We see the current account deficit, as Shaghil said, bouncing between 3 and 3½ percent of GDP through 2009 and 2010.  In the near term, you have much weaker foreign growth and a stronger dollar, but that is offset by the lower level of oil prices, so that keeps the current account deficit around the 3 to 3½ percent range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement about the current account deficit and the factors that influence it.


Passage number 89.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  Questions for our colleagues.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply acknowledges gratitude and states that there are questions for colleagues. The mention of President Bullard does not indicate any disagreement or contention either.


Passage number 90.
 MR. BULLARD.  I was just looking at the policy rates abroad here—this is the picture in exhibit 3, I guess.  It shows the ECB, the Bank of Canada, and the Bank of England all leveling out before they get to zero.  Do you have a sense of what the plans are there, or what they are saying about that, or are we going to see a sort of global move to zero.  What is your sense of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking for information and seeking the opinion of someone else. There is no indication of opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 91.
 MR. AHMED.  Looking at the policy that is going forward, first of all, we are forecasting here what we think they will do, not necessarily what we think they should do.  Given their past behavior, we think that they will be ratcheting up the rates the first chance they get.  The timing is a bit different, but the rates are broadly in line with market participants’ expectations.  In the case of the euro area, for example, at the end we are even a little lower than the market participants are expecting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a forecast and comparing it to market expectations. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 92.
 MR. BULLARD.  So this is from surveys of market participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating that the information comes from surveys of market participants. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 93.
 MR. AHMED.  No.  This is our projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a fact (projection) without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 94.
   MR. BULLARD.  Right.  But you are getting the information from surveys and other things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 95.
 MR. AHMED.  It is informed by surveys, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Ahmed states that the information is informed by surveys, suggesting that it is based on research or data collection.


Passage number 96.
 MR. SHEETS.  I would add that I think the ECB in particular has a real aversion to policy activism.  In fact, Trichet was on the wires this morning indicating that they are not really comfortable with where they are right now.  They may pause in January, and I think it really would take a more severe outcome for activity in the euro area than what we have incorporated in our forecast to get the ECB down to zero.  Nevertheless, that is a risk.  I would say that there are downside risks here.  I would put a higher probability on seeing the Bank of England or the Bank of Canada go to zero.  But as Shaghil emphasized, here we are basically just writing down what we think they are going to do, and we generally follow the futures markets fairly closely.  But it certainly would be a surprise to me if, over the next six months, we saw other major central banks in the proximity of zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreement. It is discussing the central banks' potential actions and the analyst's thoughts on the matter.


Passage number 97.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. This is because the passage only mentions "President Fisher" without any specific information or context that would suggest disagreement or contention.


Passage number 98.
 MR. FISHER.  Just a comment on the projections for China—these numbers seem to be less than what they are saying officially.  Am I correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage indicates that the numbers provided for China are lower than the official figures, suggesting agreement or acknowledgement of discrepancy rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 99.
 MR. AHMED.  Yes.  These numbers are less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "These numbers are less."


Passage number 100.
 MR. FISHER.  That sort of jibes with the reports that I am hearing back from the CEOs doing business in China.  In fact, the cutback has been much more dramatic than they expected.  Semiconductor firms, for example, have put ship-stop orders, meaning they are stopping for lack of payment, and the retailers are seeing a noticeable drop in attendance at their stores.  But I think that our numbers are more fitting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a similarity between their reports and the reports from CEOs in China, as well as providing additional examples and personal perspective on the situation.


Passage number 101.
 MR. AHMED.  I think the latest official numbers don’t incorporate the November data, which just came out—actually, they came out yesterday—and some trade data since the Greenbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Ahmed regarding the latest official numbers not incorporating some recent data.


Passage number 102.
 MR. FISHER.  But you are saying that we do expect further currency depreciation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker expects further currency depreciation.


Passage number 103.
 MR. AHMED.  In the near term, yes, through the first half of next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Ahmed, is providing a statement without any conflicting viewpoints or opposition.


Passage number 104.
 MR. FISHER.  I have three questions, Mr. Chairman.  One on the commercial paper market.  What is the spread between A1/P1 and A2/P2 right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks a question and requests information about the spread between two types of commercial paper.


Passage number 105.
 MR. DUDLEY.  For term, it is a huge spread, probably 300 basis points or so, but overnight it is much smaller.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides information about the spread of term and overnight rates, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 106.
 MR. COVITZ.  As you go out the term, it is even more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement or observation made by Mr. Covitz.


Passage number 107.
 MR. FISHER.  So the incentive for A1/P1 borrowers is to do everything they can to keep that status, obviously.  It is a much more attractive proposition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact and explaining that it is an attractive proposition for A1/P1 borrowers to maintain their status.


Passage number 108.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 109.
 MR FISHER.  Which leads to more-conservative financial management and business management.  You do everything you can not to become an A2/P2 borrower, to slip off the A1/P1 ladder.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that one should strive to avoid being categorized as an A2/P2 borrower and to stay off the A1/P1 ladder, suggesting that it is better to have conservative financial and business management practices.


Passage number 110.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Historically BBB was the sweet spot of the corporate capital structure, and that was associated with A2/P2 commercial paper borrowing, which people thought was safe.  It turned out not to be quite as attractive as they had thought.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. The statement is simply providing information about the historical perception of BBB as a safe borrowing option, which later turned out to be less attractive than initially believed.


Passage number 111.
 MR COVITZ.  I think over history this isn’t the only time when A2/P2s have come under stress.  Whenever there were disruptions in the market—for example, after the California utilities defaulted in the early part of the decade—A2/P2 outstandings plummeted, and A2/P2 spreads rose, though not nearly to this magnitude.  This is truly extraordinary.  But that is a portion of the market that is under stress because this market in general tends to be very, very skittish.  At the first sign of trouble, there is quantity rationing.  I didn’t show the outstandings of the A2/P2s, but they have gone down—as I think I mentioned—40 percent in the last couple of months.  So quantity rationing is already taking place, and they are having trouble getting over year-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is an explanation of historical events and current market conditions.


Passage number 112.
 MR. FISHER.  I guess my point is that the way in which it works is that it gives people incentives to be even more conservative in the financial management of their operations.  On household credit, do we have a sense of how much shift is taking place between credit card usage and debit card usage.  Under these conditions of duress, has that been a noticeable change, or is it just marginal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is a series of questions and statements made by Mr. Fisher, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 113.
 MR. COVITZ.  I don’t know those data.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Covitz simply states that he doesn't know the data.


Passage number 114.
 MR. FISHER.  It might be something to look at next time.  Finally, on the inflation table in exhibit 5—and you have talked about the numbers that were released this morning—do you see additional monthly deflationary numbers on the headline CPI, or could you see this happening for a prolonged period, say for a quarter.  We have a table here for 2008, 2009, and 2010.  On the top line, the PCE price index, do we envision monthly or perhaps quarterly extensions of deflationary headline numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage is simply asking a question and discussing the possibility of deflationary numbers in the PCE price index. There is no contention or disagreement stated or implied.


Passage number 115.
 MR. STOCKTON.  No.  We have another two months of small declines anticipated as the energy prices continue to pass through and then, beyond that, some small increases.  So we don’t see this as an extended period of negative headline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating their prediction for future energy prices without any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 116.
 MR. FISHER.  So December/January.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply states a month.


Passage number 117.
 MR. STOCKTON.  December/January—exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states the month as December/January without any conflicting information or opposing viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 118.
 MR. FISHER.  And what is the order of magnitude.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The use of the phrase "And what is the order of magnitude" suggests that Mr. Fisher is questioning or challenging something. Without additional context, it is not clear what specifically is being debated or disagreed upon, but there is an indication of disagreement or differing perspectives.


Passage number 119.
 MR. STOCKTON.  We are looking for about minus 0.5 percent in December and minus 0.1 in January.  We are also not expecting the core figures to remain as low as they have been running for the past month or two.  We do think that they have been held down by some very significant declines in air fares.  That could continue for another month or two—again, as the energy price pass-through works.  They have also been held down by some very large declines in lodging away from home, which is a volatile series, and it is not likely to sustain this level.  Despite the fact that we don’t see them as low as they have been the past two months—that is, declining to flat—we are expecting some fairly small increases going forward.  We have core inflation heading down, and all of these exhibits have shown a significant reduction in price pressures coming from import prices, from energy prices, and from broader commodity prices as well as the increase in slack that, as Stephanie pointed out, is keeping a real lid on labor costs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting information and explaining their expectations about inflation and price pressures, without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 120.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is expressing gratitude to the chairman. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this statement.


Passage number 121.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the question to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 122.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our staff does such a fine job.  Maybe my hearing is going, but I missed the names of our staff presenters.  Can we get them introduced to us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any disagreement or contention. It is a statement expressing gratitude and a request for clarification.


Passage number 123.
   MS. AARONSON.  I’m Stephanie Aaronson.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement of the speaker's name.


Passage number 124.
 MR. COVITZ.  I’m Dan Covitz.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage simply states the speaker's name, Mr. Covitz, without presenting any information or opinion that could lead to contention or disagreement.


Passage number 125.
 MR. AHMED.  Shaghil Ahmed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states the name "Shaghil Ahmed" as a part of Mr. Ahmed's introduction or identification.


Passage number 126.
 MR. LACKER.  Great.  Thank you very much.  I have a question for Stephanie.  You know, they do such a great job.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and admiration for Stephanie's job performance.


Passage number 127.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Jeff, are you feeling okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage doesn't contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 128.
  [Laughter] MR. STOCKTON.  We apologize for our lack of manners.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. The speaker is apologizing for their lack of manners, which implies a recognition of their mistake and a desire to rectify it.


Passage number 129.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  Maybe it is a southern thing, I don’t know.  [Laughter]  The sectoral reallocation is really intriguing, and it is something that I have been curious about in this whole episode.  The measure is not one I am familiar with.  It is one for which you count each industry as a unit, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses curiosity and acknowledges that they are not familiar with a certain measure.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 130.
 MS. AARONSON.  Exactly.  It is a Lilien type of dispersion index.  This isn’t actually how we calculate it, but it is essentially how the industry’s share of employment changes relative to total employment.  So it is the growth in that industry’s employment relative to total employment.  What we do is that we know that over the business cycle each industry has a typical pattern—durables employment goes down a lot during recessions whereas, say, health care doesn’t go down that much.  Those types of changes aren’t typically associated with sectoral reallocation.  That is, we don’t really think of those things that are typical over the cycle as being associated with an increase in the NAIRU.  We want to take those out, so we take out the typical cyclical movements, such as manufacturing always goes down in a recession and finance is acyclical.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker mentions that the Lilien index is not actually how they calculate it, implying a difference in calculating methods or interpretations between the speaker and the industry.


Passage number 131.
 MR. LACKER.  And housing always goes down in a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "And housing always goes down in a recession" is a commonly accepted fact and does not involve any dispute or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 132.
 MR. AARONSON.  Housing and construction always go down, so we take that out, and then we say, okay, so now there are these atypical movements that are greater than we usually see.  That is what we would consider the sectoral reallocation.  That is what is left over.  You can see, as I mentioned in the briefing, that actually during recessions there is a lot of sectoral reallocation, even once you take out the usual declines in employment that differ across industries.  That is because each recession has different causes.  Different industries have grown a lot during the boom—like finance recently or, say, communications during the late 1990s—and those sectors are going to shrink more than usual during the recessions and get back to more of an equilibrium state.  That is what is going on here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the concept of sectoral reallocation and providing examples to support their explanation.


Passage number 133.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  So it is sort of a bummer that these go up in the recession if you are trying to measure what is happening to the NAIRU.  But I always thought of the phrase “sectoral reallocation” as having to do with the theories of the business cycle in which cyclical downturns are caused by an unexpected decline in a given industry that causes resources to shift out of that industry and that it takes time for them to be absorbed into some other industry.  From that point of view—if you are trying to measure that component as opposed to policy-induced, widespread declines in activity—I would think you would want not to take out the cyclical part.  I am thinking about housing.  We devoted a lot of resources to housing in 2005, much less now.  Those resources thrown on the market, in fact, are the proximal cause of the initial downturn in employment growth.  A lot of ancillary industries are related, so I would think that, if we didn’t take out the usual housing cyclical thing, which is really sharp in the early periods, you would see a bigger rise here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing their own thoughts and observations.


Passage number 134.
   MS. AARONSON.  I have looked at that, and actually, it doesn’t make that much of a difference.  Construction goes down in every recession, and so by that measure sectoral reallocation is higher in every recession.  I mean, construction is contributing more to sectoral reallocation here than in previous recessions because the declines have been larger.  So that fact is captured.  The fact that construction is having a larger-than-typical decline is precisely what is captured here.  But even if you said, okay, well, maybe in every recession industries shrink and that is associated with some sectoral reallocation, the measure actually looks very similar—not just across the current episode but across all the episodes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing a analysis and explanation of the data.


Passage number 135.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, yes.  I guess it is also related to how you think about the NAIRU.  To some extent, if unemployment goes up in recessions, then what unemployment is supposed to be goes up in recessions as well, it seems.  I have a question about the first exhibit.  It is the first set of exhibits.  It is also about commercial paper.  Would you folks encourage us to view the improvement that has taken place in the A2/P2 market as a measure of how the A1/P1 market might have improved had we not intervened.  It is sort of a baseline, right.  It is like the control group.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking a question and seeking clarification on a specific topic.


Passage number 136.
 MR. COVITZ.  I think it is very difficult to interpret it that way because the intervention did happen and the bulk of the improvements happened subsequent to the intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is providing their perspective on the situation, but there is no clear contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 137.
 MR. LACKER.  What sort of spillovers from our intervention in A1/P1 do we expect perhaps to have influenced or to have led to an improvement in A2/P2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification about the potential effects of their intervention.


Passage number 138.
 MR. COVITZ.  I think that the decline in the A2/P2 overnight suggests improvement.  But there is some concern about sample selection, and you have to worry about that at the same time.  It could be just that you are getting higher-quality issuers in the A2/P2 sector.  But it turns out you’re not.  It turns out that it explains only about half of that decline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement. It presents information about the decline in the A2/P2 sector and discusses the potential factors contributing to it.


Passage number 139.
 MR. DUDLEY.  You know, it also may have helped the money market fund industry to keep its money knowing that there was a facility outstanding that could provide liquidity for that sector because we did see inflows back into the money market mutual funds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents a statement or observation made by Mr. Dudley.


Passage number 140.
 MR. LACKER.  So their willingness to buy A2/P2 may have been affected by another program, not the CP one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement between the parties involved. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker presenting a possibility or alternative explanation for the willingness to buy A2/P2.


Passage number 141.
  You are saying the money market fund program— MR. DUDLEY.  They provided more stability to the system as a whole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a simple statement, without any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a factual statement or acknowledgement made by Mr. Dudley.


Passage number 142.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  To the prime money funds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any kind of contention or disagreement. It only states the subject of the discussion, which is "prime money funds."


Passage number 143.
  MR. LACKER.  So we can’t separate the individual programs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the inability to separate individual programs.


Passage number 144.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  There is a second factor.  There has been discussion of extending the A1/P1 program to A2/P2, which the industry is certainly aware of, but I would highlight with the A2/P2 that a lot of the mutual funds do not want to hold it over the end of the year.  Most of the A2/P2 borrowers are having trouble rolling over year-end.  There is a real risk that that market will have to rely on backup lines of credit, and it’s not clear whether the A2/P2 market comes back after the New Year, if that happens, or in what capacity it does.  So I think the real test will be to look at this chart in January or February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information about the potential extension of a program and discussing the challenges faced by borrowers. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 145.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, you wouldn’t expect speculation about imminent extension of the program to A2/P2 to support the overnight rate for A2/P2 unless they expect it to be implemented overnight.  A question about strains:  To what extent are we able to disentangle whether the market is strained or the issuers are strained.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It consists of speculative statements and questions about the implementation of a program and the strain on the market or issuers.


Passage number 146.
 MR. COVITZ.  In the CP market itself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or statements that suggest contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a topic without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 147.
 MR. DUDLEY.  You can look at credit ratings, for example, or what’s happening to their profitability.  It is highly likely that the strains in the CP market are more dramatic than any change in the underlying financial condition of the A2/P2 borrowers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion that the strains in the CP market are more dramatic than any change in the underlying financial condition of the A2/P2 borrowers.


Passage number 148.
 MR. COVITZ.  You could think about what the default risk is, say, for the corporate sector.  You could break down a pretty simple model of defaults conditional upon our outlook for the economy, and that would have the default rate rising.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting a potential approach to analyzing the default risk in the corporate sector.


Passage number 149.
 MR. LACKER.  But you don’t observe investors’ expected defaults themselves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Lacker does not observe investors' expected defaults.


Passage number 150.
 MR. COVITZ.  You don’t, but you can take a guess at what you think that is, and it is higher.  It is not at Great Depression levels under any of the models I’ve looked at.  It’s not even at the levels of default rates in 2002.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting factual information about the current situation.


Passage number 151.
 MR. LACKER.  So you are saying that this paper is underpriced.  Is that how you measure strains.  I am always curious as to what strains mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Lacker is simply expressing curiosity and seeking clarification about the meaning of "strains." He is not expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 152.
 MR. COVITZ.  The way that I’m referring to it is just that risk premiums are really, really large.  I’m not saying that they are necessarily irrational.  I am just saying that they are really, really large.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Covitz regarding the size of risk premiums.


Passage number 153.
 MR. LACKER.  Thanks.  Great job.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses appreciation or praise.


Passage number 154.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but you did not provide the passage you want me to analyze for contention or disagreement. Please include the passage in your question, and I'd be happy to help you.


Passage number 155.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question or observation, which is of the optimistic variety although it presents sort of a challenge.  In the medium-term outlook in exhibit 4, if you focus on 2010, the Greenbook projection has real GDP growing at 2.4 percent.  We’re beginning to come out of this.  The unemployment rate is peaking.  If you could implement the optimal control federal funds rate, it would be bottoming out.  Maybe that would mean whatever quantitative easing credit programs we would be doing would be at their peak and maybe would be coming off.  But it is also the time that the inflation rate is low and continuing to fall.  This is going to be a tension for us as we start thinking about, and we are about to engage in mentioning, the possibility that inflation could be—well, whatever—lower than ideal.  What would you guess the risks might be around that inflation forecast.  How hard is it going to be for us not to continue to worry about inflation being low or to communicate that inflation is going to continue to be low even though things are improving.  Just any kind of advice would be helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing an observation and seeking advice.


Passage number 156.
 MR. STOCKTON.  My guess is that, if our baseline forecast evolves in the way we are expecting here, you are still going to be worried about the downside risk to inflation even if, in fact, we were in the process of bottoming out because there will still be a very substantial output gap.  On the commodity price side, things are fairly stable, and at least in our forecast, inflation expectations are probably drifting down some.  On the other hand, there are upside risks to that inflation forecast as well.  I do actually think that our baseline forecast, on the assumptions that we have had to make in constructing it, is reasonably well balanced because another possibility is, in contrast to the gradual downtrend that we’re expecting in inflation expectations, that inflation expectations will be stickier, you will be able to convey a greater sense that you wouldn’t want inflation over the longer haul moving down below 1 percent, we won’t get as much disinflation into inflation expectations or into labor costs, and you’ll get greater stability there than we’re expecting.  So to my mind, looking ahead, monitoring how those inflation expectations evolve in the context of an economy where things are weakening will be very important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different possibilities and acknowledging both the downside and upside risks to the inflation forecast. There is no indication of conflicting viewpoints among the speakers.


Passage number 157.
 MR. EVANS.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage simply shows gratitude or appreciation from Mr. Evans towards someone or something else. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 158.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions President Bullard without providing any information or context that indicates there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 159.
 MR. BULLARD.  On the same topic—the medium-term outlook and, in particular, the optimal control exercise at the bottom, which is showing us how we’re constrained—is there some quantitative policy that we could undertake that would get us to the green lines here, maybe by creating more inflation than we would think desirable in the long run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a question asked by Mr. Bullard about whether there is a policy that can achieve a certain outcome.


Passage number 160.
 MR. STOCKTON.  The point of constructing this optimal control is to say that, gee, if you weren’t constrained, here is how we thought optimal behavior—the sort of optimal outcome—would be, given the shocks.  You’re asking me whether or not there are quantitative policies that you could put in place.  I was actually hoping that you folks were going to be able to tell me.  [Laughter]  You face a challenge in constructing policy, but we have collectively a challenge in understanding how whatever policies you implement are actually going to show through into our longer-term outlook.  The point here is that, in the absence of some nonconventional monetary policy actions or substantial fiscal stimulus, we see a very extended period of weak activity, high output gap, and declining inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 161.
 MR. BULLARD.  Sometimes what people do is they say, okay, suppose you could just control inflation directly, which we know is hard, but suppose then you just trace out an optimal path for inflation that would get you to the green line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting a hypothetical scenario and discussing a potential strategy without expressing any disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 162.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Obviously, if you could levitate inflation expectations, that would be one thing.  The other thing is that note 21 in the package we sent you included some exercises that suggested, if you took actions that could significantly reduce the long-term Treasury rate and compress mortgage spreads, there would be ways in which you’d be able to provide more stimulus for the economy.  Now, all those things we suggested, at least the ones that we showed in that note, weren’t sufficient to get you back to equilibrium quickly.  But there are policies, obviously, that we think will be able to provide some stimulus.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply presenting different ideas or suggestions for providing stimulus to the economy.


Passage number 163.
 MR. BULLARD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 164.
  This optimal control exercise then would have an objective that would be a quadratic objective in some real output or unemployment— MS. AARONSON.  Minimizing the unemployment rate and the deviations of inflation from its target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. It simply states that the objective of the optimal control exercise would be a quadratic objective in some real output or unemployment, and then mentions the specific objectives of minimizing the unemployment rate and deviations of inflation from its target. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 165.
 MR. BULLARD.  That’s saying that you wouldn’t be willing to suspend your inflation target for a while to improve things on the real side.  I think that might be helpful as well because then the Committee could think about what those tradeoffs are.  In ordinary times, you might have a certain weight on the two objectives, but you might shift that in other situations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Bullard discussing the possibility of suspending the inflation target for a while to improve the real side. There is no indication of disagreement or contention among the parties involved.


Passage number 166.
 MS. AARONSON.  If I can also just put this in a little more context—by the end of 2010, the gap on the unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control is about 1 percentage point.  So if you use a simple rule of thumb from an Okun’s law type of model, that would be a couple of percentage points on the level of GDP.  GDP would have to grow a couple of percentage points faster over 2009 and 2010 to close that 1 percentage point gap in the unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage as it only mentions President Lockhart without providing any additional information or context.


Passage number 168.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Question for Nathan.  In an earlier meeting, if I recall correctly, there was mention of the European banks’ exposure to emerging-market sovereign debt—a concern about the trend lines in that sovereign debt.  Are you tracking that in any sense.  My concern is that there could be another full-blown debt crisis of some kind coming.  It is not covered in these charts, but do you have a sense of default risk on the part of emerging-market sovereigns.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question asking for information and expressing a concern.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 169.
 MR. SHEETS.  The European banks are particularly exposed, much more so than U.S. banks or Japanese banks.  A big chunk of that exposure is to central and eastern Europe, and as you suggest, we see significant risks to the European banks as a result of that exposure.  What makes it even a little dicier is that exposure is concentrated in several countries, particularly Sweden, Austria, and to a slightly lesser extent Italy.  Recently there has been significant economic turmoil in Hungary and Ukraine.  The Fund has stepped in, and the EU has helped as well with large financing packages.  The latest one we’re watching very closely is the situation in Latvia, where the exchange rate is significantly overvalued.  The external position looks very, very dicey.  The Fund is in there negotiating a program.  There has been a lot of back and forth about what should be done with the exchange rate regime.  The banking system also looks vulnerable—so what should be done with the banks.  It is not exactly clear how all that is going to be resolved.  My personal feeling is that, given the risks—and the Europeans recognize the extent of the risks—if Latvia goes, it could blow out the rest of the Baltics and then sweep around into Central and Eastern Europe and then feed back into Western Europe.  So I see the risks there as being of first order for the Europeans. Given that recognition, I think that the EU and major European governments are going to do what’s necessary to make sure that the situation in Latvia stabilizes at least for a while.  The end game over the next several years is very much an open issue for a lot of these economies that were in ERM-II and evolving into hoping to adopt the euro.  I think that there are potentially some very pronounced vulnerabilities and some painful adjustment that will need to happen in some of those Central and Eastern European countries.  So absolutely that is a major risk.  It’s one we’re watching as closely as we can.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that there has been "a lot of back and forth about what should be done with the exchange rate regime" and "It is not exactly clear how all that is going to be resolved." This suggests that different parties have differing opinions on how to handle the situation, indicating contention or disagreement.


Passage number 170.
 MR. FISHER.  Nathan, you would probably have been arrested for treason if you had said that in Latvia—literally.  The economist who gives a negative forecast is arrested for treason.  Stay here.

  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  If not, let’s start our go-round with First Vice President Cumming.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The laughter suggests a light-hearted atmosphere, and the phrase "Other questions" indicates a smooth transition to a new topic. The mention of First Vice President Cumming does not introduce any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 172.
 MS. CUMMING.  Thank you.  I thought I would make a couple of points that underscore the substantial increase in the downside risks that we incorporated into the forecast that you all received on Friday.  That change was really encouraged by our economic advisory panel, which suggested that the downside risks were much larger than we were estimating at the end of November. First, we have been meeting, as of course all of you do, with small business people.  Bill Dudley put a panel of investors together, too, and I have a couple observations out of that and our discussions with community bankers.  One is that the cutbacks in financing are very real.  There is a lot of evidence that the banks are going in and looking at lines and cutting them back to both investors and the small-business community.  The small business community is also on the receiving end of much tighter financial management at their larger customers—that is, the people they’re supplying—as those firms are not paying their bills or are extending the terms on which they pay their bills to a much greater number of days.  That has induced a hunkering-down mentality on the part of the small business owners.  The other sobering thing they pointed out to us—and this is very much in line with Governor Duke’s comments about the community banks yesterday; we hear the same thing—is that small businesses and the community banks can hold out for a while but not forever; margins are getting squeezed, and financing is getting squeezed.  The precautionary actions that the small businesses are taking will help them for a while, but they can’t hold out for more than six or nine months. That is a particularly sobering statement for us in the Second District because, despite the fact that we are at the epicenter of the financial industry in New York—a major driver for the Second District economy—we have only just barely started to feel the effects of layoffs and reductions in activity in the city.  Our regional leading indicator index went down very, very sharply in the month of October, but that is still to be realized in the economy.  In particular, when we have looked at past episodes, the declines in incomes that we have suffered in the region have ranged between 4 percent and 10 percent in the financial industry when we actually get into one of these adverse periods.  That decline is usually spread over three or four years, so we are really talking about something that could last a good bit longer than six to nine months in our District. Second, we do a survey of inflation expectations that is in many ways similar to the Michigan survey, and our survey results are almost completed and are very similar to those of the Michigan survey.  But we do ask one question that isn’t asked there, and that is about the longer run—that is, the 2010-11 outlook for prices and inflation.  From that we can impute a risk of deflation, which was 6 or 7 percent in early October and is now 12 percent.  So that risk of deflation seems to be growing even in the kind of population that is surveyed by the Michigan folks.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Cumming mentions that their economic advisory panel suggested the downside risks were larger than estimated, implying that there may be differing opinions on the extent of the risks. Additionally, she mentions the risk of deflation, which has increased from 6 or 7 percent to 12 percent, indicating a potential disagreement on the severity of the deflation risk.


Passage number 173.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply consists of a polite expression of gratitude and a mention of President Rosengren.


Passage number 174.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As requested, I will be brief.  Like the Greenbook, we see an economy in which the unemployment rate remains very elevated, and inflation is below my target for several years.  Our own equations would indicate that these elevated unemployment rates are likely to put even more downward pressure on the inflation rate than forecast in the Greenbook.  The labor market is extremely weak, and there is a significant risk of deflation.  I believe that greater use of nontraditional policies will be needed to mitigate more-severe outcomes than encompassed in the baseline forecast. On the financial side I would just highlight two points.  First, many banks are placing interest rate floors on home equity loans and on commercial loans.  Pervasive use of floors may make the choice of which low federal funds target to pick of little relevance to actual borrowing costs.  We may want to consider surveying banks to get a better understanding of where these floors are currently being set.  Second, many firms are reporting that their lines are not being renewed and are asserting that it reflects problems with the bank not the borrower.  Discussions with community banks indicate that, for smaller borrowers, community banks are benefiting from this trend.  However, it may be useful to understand better how the reductions in lines, particularly at troubled banks, are affecting the overall economy. Just a general point.  I think bank micro behavior is going to be very important for macroeconomic outcomes, and we might want to increase the amount of effort that we are putting into understanding both their financial condition and how their behaviors may be changing over the next six to nine months.  Whether that’s done through the bank supervision process or the loan officer survey or which mechanism we use, I think we need to probably get a little more intelligence on exactly what those trends are.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their analysis of the current state of the economy and offering suggestions for policies that could be implemented.


Passage number 175.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply expresses gratitude from President Lacker.


Passage number 176.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic news since the last meeting has certainly been grim, and our presentation today bore that out.  Our directors and other District contacts are quite gloomy, and their reports are also consistent with a broad-based pullback in discretionary outlays by consumers and firms. In these circumstances with the funds rate around 1/8 percent, it is hard to see a benefit of prolonging any further reduction.  I agree with the staff analysis that any potential dislocation in money market institutions is likely to be minor, and I observe that, to the extent that money market institutions provide value to the economy in the form of circumvention of prohibitions on interest and other legal restrictions on financial arrangements, the traditional welfare analysis would count their demise as a benefit rather than a cost.  But I have to admit I haven’t tried explaining that to a money market fund manager.  [Laughter] The hard question now, I think, concerns the possibility of deflation.  We have seen negative overall inflation since energy prices peaked in July—it was 1.8 percent for the PCE at an annual rate since then and 4½ percent before today’s release for the CPI—and the core indexes have softened notably as well.  I still think we are going to be able to avoid this fairly easily, but I do not think the risk is negligible.  It is one of the most dangerous prospects we face right now, and we have to pay very close attention to it.  The reason I think it is going to be easy to avoid is that we have seen declines in core inflation before when energy prices fell—mid-2005 and late 2006 are recent examples.  Further, compensation growth does not yet appear to be slowing rapidly, although those data are fairly dated and so it is hard to sense what the last couple of months are going to look like.  The key to avoiding deflation, of course, is our ability to shape expectations about the future course of monetary policy.  I had a spirited discussion about this last night over salad with Governor Kohn and Mr. Eggertsson.  This is essentially what all the models tell you—that staying out of a deflationary equilibrium requires commitment to paths for the monetary base that are inconsistent with a steadily falling price level and that commitment to keeping the nominal interest rate low is not sufficient. Now, it is sort of hard to get a handle on this.  It took me a while, but the key to thinking about this is that models with Taylor-type rules embed within them the perfect credibility of inflation returning in the long run or over a medium term to the targeted rate that is built into the Taylor reaction function.  If instead you take those models and just allow arbitrary fiscal and monetary policy rules, that is when you are forced to face the result that committing to an infinite series of zero nominal rates is not sufficient and that you have to keep a monetary aggregate from declining along with the price level. One way to think about this is that it is just like preventing inflation.  To prevent inflation, we have to prevent expectations that the value of money will fall in the future.  To rule that out, we have to rule out expectations that the quantity of money is going to rise continually, and we do that with interest rates.  This line of reasoning is different from the reasoning you get in a Phillips curve with purely backward-looking expectations, where you have a recursive relationship between real growth and inflation.  Instead, in any model with a little forward-looking stuff, you have expectations driving things.  Preventing deflation is the same thing—preventing expectations that the value of money will rise indefinitely.  To do that you need to prevent expectations that the quantity of money will fall indefinitely, and you would like to do that with low interest rates, but you cannot at the zero bound.  So you have to influence expectations about the future course of the base.  This to me is the simple intuition for that.  All of this is just to suggest that our ability to communicate is going to be crucial.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily focuses on the speaker's analysis and thoughts on the current economic situation and the potential risk of deflation. There is a mention of a spirited discussion with others about shaping expectations about the future course of monetary policy, but there is no explicit statement of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 177.
 MR. KOHN.  Including over salad.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that something is included over salad.


Passage number 178.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All of these strategies are time-inconsistent, of course.  So we have to be willing as a Committee to sit here and accept higher-than-normal inflation ex post.  I just point that out.  We have to ask ourselves if we would be willing and if the public would be willing to accept that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is posing a question and pointing out a potential consequence of certain strategies.


Passage number 179.
 MR. LACKER.  “Time-inconsistent” is another way to say that they require commitment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing an explanation of what "time-inconsistent" means without stating or suggesting any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 180.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I understand.  I’m just saying that there are also different ways to do it.  We could also just target a higher inflation rate, which is probably another way of doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: There is a suggestion of different ways to achieve a goal, which implies a disagreement or contention over the best approach to take.


Passage number 181.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  You could target the inflation rate not falling.  I mean, we don’t have to go all the way.  This is the subtle thing about this.  I think the pure Taylor rule overstates our credibility, but people do not think that we are going to follow it perfectly.  They don’t have very diffuse priors over what policies.  We are somewhere in-between, and I think bolstering that credibility is important.  Something I was going to say in the policy round—given that we haven’t announced a target, we ought to try that first.  That comes first, before saying that we are going to move our target up for a little while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is discussing the need to target inflation rates and the importance of bolstering credibility, but there is no indication of any opposing views or disagreement among speakers.


Passage number 182.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would just comment—and I think that your point is a good one—as we go forward, we are going to be thinking hard about how to influence expectations.  Absolutely.  Your point is also right, as we discussed earlier, about why we need additional policies besides our zero rate policy, either other kinds of quantitative policies that are obviously linked to base movements or fiscal or other policies as well.  So I don’t think there is that much disagreement on the analysis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges the points made by the other person and agrees with them, stating that there is not much disagreement on the analysis.


Passage number 183.
 MR. LACKER.  No, I do not think so.  The point I was making about the base is that none of those is sufficient to rule out deflation without specifying what the base is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply explaining his point about the base and stating that none of the mentioned factors are enough to rule out deflation without further specifying the base being referred to.


Passage number 184.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear statements or positions that could generate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 185.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The reports from my contacts have been very weak for several weeks now.  Sadly, I feel as though the data have been catching up with the anecdotal comments that I have been receiving for a while.  I have been hearing a lot of comments along the lines of “orders have fallen off a sheer cliff,” “the lights were suddenly switched off,” and “my business is dead in the water.”  One thing I have noticed is that the negative outlook has spread to more and more corners of the economy, even those corners that had remained robust for a relatively longer period.  For example, one of my directors, who runs a manufacturing company and exports 70 percent of his products, is a producer of highly specialized equipment that is used in steel production.  He has few competitors and no debt, and until recently he was feeling very comfortable with a two and a half year backlog.  Last week he reported that the backlog has essentially vanished.  His customers’ problems have now become his problems.  This has become a typical refrain.  We had become used to hearing companies talk about their desire to hold onto liquidity.  Now businesses are also focused on how they are going to protect themselves in this weakening economy.  Even businesses with a healthy amount of cash are cutting back sharply on investment, hiring, and production plans.   In this environment, it is clear that forecasts need to be revised down sharply.  Like the Greenbook, my own projection, which seemed pretty dire just a month ago, has also been revised down sharply with the incoming data and anecdotes.  The question now is how long and how deep a decline we will experience.  At the same time, it also remains difficult to judge how far disinflation will go.  My projection sees substantial output gaps and energy prices that are likely to remain low.  That has caused me to lower my inflation projection further as well.  My inflation forecast now is clearly below desirable levels for much of 2009.  Still, it looks as though the risks remain very much to the downside for output and inflation, if only because further downside misses are getting more and more problematic.  The insurance metaphor, I think, has been exhausted.  We are now more in a situation of treating mass trauma.  Perhaps some of our actions will later be judged as having gone too far.  But in my view, right now it clearly is better to ensure that the treatment is large enough rather than risk falling short.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely the speaker sharing their observations and projections based on the data and anecdotes they have received.


Passage number 186.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not contain any contentious or disagreeable content. It is a polite expression of gratitude from President Plosser.


Passage number 187.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Third District economic news is similar to the national news.  It’s all bad.  Our December business outlook survey, which remains confidential until Thursday, will post another very weak number.  In November the number was minus 39.3.  The December reading will be released, and it will be minus 32.9—somewhat better but still deeply in negative territory.  New orders, shipments, and employment are all very weak.  Price indexes on the survey have fallen appreciably below zero for the past two months and are near their lowest levels since we began the survey in 1969.  This is after being at nearly their highest levels over the same interval just a few months ago.  Moreover, firms are expecting prices to continue to decline.  November’s reading marked the first time that the future prices-paid index has been negative.  The mood is generally quite grim.  The Greenbook also paints a very bleak picture.  I would like to think that this isn’t the most likely outcome, but it is increasingly difficult to argue against that based on recent economic data.  I have revised down my own forecast, of course.  Although I’m still not quite as pessimistic as the Greenbook, I admit that the Greenbook is no longer an outlier as I am used to thinking about it.  The forecasts for output are nearly as bad as or are worse than the economy experienced in 1974-75.  Inflation has moderated significantly, and near-term inflationary expectations have also moderated.  Our December Livingston survey participants see CPI inflation averaging just ½ percent in 2009.  In the Greenbook, forecasted core inflation will be just over 1 percent next year and will decelerate to ¾ percent in 2010. With the growth prospects so weak and inflation expectations decelerating, the appropriate real funds rate obviously will probably decline, raising the possibility as we discussed yesterday that the zero bound on nominal rates will pose a problem for us.  At the same time, since mid-September the effective funds rate has been trading well below the FOMC’s target of 1 percent.  As we discussed yesterday, we are effectively conducting monetary policy through quantitative easing—by which I mean an expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet by both conventional and nonconventional means.  I have no objections in principle to this easing process; but as I discussed yesterday, I believe that we need to acknowledge publicly that we are now in a new regime, with a new way of implementing monetary policy, and that it is a deliberate choice of this Committee.  Otherwise we risk confusing market participants or implying that we are no longer in control of monetary policy.  But in doing so, we need to communicate how this policy will be conducted going forward.  The Board of Governors and the FOMC will have to decide how they will handle the governance issues surrounding this new regime.  It seems clear to me that monetary policy determinations should remain in the purview of the FOMC regardless of whether we are using standard or nonstandard policy tools. Thus, I think we have to come to grips with three very important policy issues at this juncture.  They include (1) how to implement monetary policy via an expansion of our balance sheets for standard fed funds targeting; (2) what decisionmaking process the FOMC and the Board should use in implementing these policies via the balance sheet expansion; and (3) how to communicate all of these to the public in a transparent and, most important, credible fashion.  I agree with the Chairman that we need to maintain and embrace the collaborative process between the Board of Governors and the FOMC, which has been our method of moving forward during this crisis.  But I remain convinced that in these times of uncertainty we need to be explicit and to communicate that monetary policy remains under the purview of the FOMC.  As we discussed yesterday, our primary goal is to set policy that yields the best economic outcomes for the economy, consistent with our dual mandate.  I think our history demonstrates that the institutional structure of the FOMC and clearly articulated goals and methods yield the best policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is providing a summary of economic news and expressing his own views and concerns about monetary policy. He acknowledges that the Greenbook's forecast is similar to his own revised forecast and emphasizes the need for clear communication and decision-making processes in implementing monetary policy. While there may be different opinions or perspectives on these issues, they are not explicitly stated in the passage.


Passage number 188.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not involve any claim or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude to President Lockhart.


Passage number 189.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think President Fisher at the last meeting actually proposed that, since we all knew where the economy was, we just suspend discussion and get on to what to do about it.  Forgive me for a six-week reaction function here, President Fisher, but I tend to agree with that.  I will be very brief.  The points I will make have either been made or will be made, I am sure.  [Laughter]  We are facing dysfunctional financial markets, a rapidly weakening real economy, and a very negative psychology, a darkening mood.  In addition, I am picking up in my contacts uncertainty or even questioning of what can be done and what good anything close to conventional monetary policy will do.  My board of directors, advisory councils, and other contacts reflect deepening pessimism, and many of those contacts confirm the view that consumer activity and the economy in general pulled back dramatically in September and October. I have adjusted my forecast similarly to the Greenbook and commercial forecasters.  I think it is very difficult at this point to forecast with any confidence that conditions will gel in a way necessary for a recovery.  The Greenbook sees a somewhat sharper snapback by midyear, reflecting the influence of a fiscal stimulus, than I am prepared at this time to project.  Our forecast assumes a protracted period of weakness through all of 2009, somewhat more along the lines of the “more financial stress” scenario in the Greenbook. Regarding financial markets, I would just comment that the pressures on the hedge fund sector have clearly not abated and may be intensifying.  Over the weekend we picked up rumors of a Fed intervention that has not been discussed here, so I presume that it was just a rumor.  Nonetheless, rumors were circulating that a major hedge fund group was about to collapse and that our people were “in,” so to speak, over the weekend.  As Bill mentioned yesterday, the Madoff scandal certainly has not helped the picture regarding hedge funds. Regarding risks, it is not my baseline scenario, but the risk of deflation obviously cannot be ignored, and the apparent speed of disinflation is quite a concern.  The Atlanta staff prepared several forecast scenarios, and there were some plausible downside scenarios that really were quite ugly.  So to preview later comments, I think the balance of risks at this point is decidedly to the downside and justifies a trauma-management approach—or, in more normal terms, a risk-management approach—of acting aggressively at this meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is mostly agreeing with what President Fisher proposed at the last meeting and is expressing concerns and uncertainties about the state of the economy.

Passage number 194.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 195.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth District’s economy, like the others, has systematically worsened.  Layoffs are increasing.  Our retail sales are down.  The housing market is certainly not improving, and manufacturing has weakened.  In our two stronger areas, energy is showing a pretty good slowdown with these falloffs in prices, and rigs are being stacked; the agricultural sector is also feeling the pressure as commodity prices fall.  So it is uniformly poor.  As far as the national economy and outlook go, I have no major differences with the outlook that has been presented by others.  I would tell you that we have done different projections ourselves.  I think a lot depends on what will be developed on the fiscal side as we move from here, and I am kind of waiting to see about that. I do have one other comment and perhaps request as we think about this, and it follows on yesterday’s conversation.  It strikes me, as I look broadly and see what’s happening in our own region, that the intermediation process is broken as it goes through the banking industry and then more broadly than that.  The deleveraging process that is under way is actually accelerating—it is worsening and complicating our ability to fix the intermediation process.  As a result, we as the central bank are going around that process as we try to get credit working, and I understand that.  But it does have consequences—some good for those particular markets where we’re bringing intermediation forward but also perhaps some not so good as other sectors are left behind in that.  My point is that we really do have to focus, in working on the fiscal side with the Treasury or whomever, on fixing the broken intermediation process, and that is the banking industry.  I know we are working with the TARP.  It needs some additional work.  But out of that comes my request.  We spent a fair amount of time yesterday talking about the Japanese experience.  I wonder if we wouldn’t benefit if we looked at the Nordic experience of the early ’90s—how you go in, take a look at that, and how you conduct policy around that—and have a discussion among ourselves because I think there are some lessons there that we might learn to our benefit as we move forward from here.  That’s a suggestion I have, not just my report on the District.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply providing information about the state of the economy in the Tenth District and expressing their agreement with the national economic outlook. They also make a request and suggest looking at the Nordic experience as a potential source of learning.


Passage number 196.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  It was a good suggestion.  I have looked at that example and had a chance to talk with Stefan Ingves, who is the Governor of the Central Bank of Sweden and was very much involved in that.  It was a very good and prompt response, but it was different from our current situation in that the banks were already mostly insolvent and no longer functioning when the government intervened.  They took the standard steps of taking off nonperforming loans—so the usual process.  They still had a significant recession.  I think the basic lessons are there, but we have some characteristics in this particular episode—banks still functioning, the complexity of the assets, and so on—that make it even more difficult.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Instead, it simply presents a statement and offers an explanation.


Passage number 197.
 MR. HOENIG.  I agree with that, but at the same time, I see the similarity.  When you don’t go in and try to drive it back quickly, you get the Japanese outcome of prolonging it.  I don’t know where the banks are yet, but I know that things are getting worse and that the intermediation process is broken.  So just maybe there is something in-between—something that can be done that forces outcomes for some of these banks.  Even though they are not insolvent as such, we have poured a ton of equity into those institutions, and I am not sure if we shouldn’t have added some other elements to that that might have helped on the other side.  That’s my point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

The passage shows a single speaker expressing their opinion and discussing their thoughts and observations on the topic at hand. There isn't any indication of any disagreement or contention within the passage.


Passage number 198.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If you can indulge just one more observation, which is that one thing we learn from these episodes is that the political economy matters tremendously.  The public is very reluctant to get involved in putting money into banks, and only when they become persuaded that doing so is essential do you get that result.  In Japan it took a long time.  In Sweden it was much quicker, and that’s an important element.  A two-hander from President Bullard.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states an observation about the importance of political economy in certain situations.


Passage number 199.
 MR. BULLARD.  May I just make one comment on that.  For those of you who have not read about the Nordic experience, Seppo Honkapohja, who is a member of the Board of the Bank of Finland, has given a speech within the last two months.  You can probably go to the Bank of Finland web page.  There may be other information, but that is just one summary from a person who lived through it and has been involved in policy for a long time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any evidence of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a speech by Seppo Honkapohja and suggests that interested individuals can find more information on the Bank of Finland website.


Passage number 200.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 201.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my view, cumulative recessionary dynamics are deeply entrenched, with mounting job losses leading to weaker consumer spending, tighter credit, more job losses, and so on; and this nasty set of economic linkages is gaining momentum.  Like the Greenbook, I anticipate a long period of decline, and in fact, the consensus forecast is that we’re now in the longest and one of the deepest postwar recessions. I hope that a recovery will begin in the middle of next year, but the risks seem skewed to the downside for several reasons.  First, compared with the average recession, we face unusually difficult financial conditions.  My contacts complain bitterly that even firms with sterling credit ratings have difficulty securing credit.  Some banks appear reluctant to lend because financial markets are skeptical about the quality of their assets and their reported net worth.  An accounting joke concerning the balance sheets of many financial institutions is now making the rounds, and it summarizes the situation as follows:  On the left-hand side, nothing is right; and on the right-hand side, nothing is left.  [Laughter]  The second factor skewing risk to the downside is the unusually fearful and pessimistic psychology that’s developed.  One director, who heads a national department chain, predicts carnage in the retail sector after year-end, as stores close after trying to hold on through the holidays.  Although some stores have been able to keep sales up to reasonable levels, heavy price discounting will translate into huge losses.  Businesses have also generally turned very cautious, hoarding cash and slashing capital spending.  A third factor that worries me is that, in contrast to many past recessions, this one is global in nature, and the fact that it’s a worldwide slowdown—while lowering commodity prices, which is good—is also going to make it harder for us to pull out. Turning just very briefly to the labor market, the Beveridge curve chart that Stephanie presented during her briefing suggests that we have seen an unusually large increase in the unemployment rate recently in comparison with the decline in job openings, at least in the JOLTS data.  I think one interpretation might be that the unemployment rate has risen in part because we have had an unusual rise in labor force participation during this recession.  Labor force participation has been higher than would be expected, particularly for three demographic groups:  young adults, married women, and older workers nearing retirement.  Analysis by my staff estimates that this rise in participation could reflect behavioral responses to unusual credit constraints and wealth declines.  Specifically, young adults aged 20 to 24 years appear to be entering the labor force in unusual numbers, and that might reflect diminished access to student loans.  Similarly, more married women are entering the labor force, and that’s a possible reflection of diminished access to home equity and credit card loans.  Finally, an unusually large number of older workers are in the labor market, and that may reflect the negative wealth shock associated with the collapse of housing values and the plummeting stock market.  All in all, I expect the anomalous increase in labor force participation to put continued upward pressure on the unemployment rate. With respect to inflation, developments since our October meeting have again lowered the outlook.  I’m particularly concerned about the disinflationary effect of actual and prospective economic slack.  During the postwar period, core PCE inflation has actually fallen at least ¾ percentage point in every single year in which unemployment has averaged 7½ percent or more.  Given that in each of the next two years the unemployment rate is predicted to average at least 8 percent, it seems quite likely that by the end of 2010 core inflation will have fallen at least 1½ percentage points.  That creates a very real risk of deflation.  So under these circumstances, I definitely believe that we should do everything in our power to stimulate aggregate demand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
Explanation: The speaker is expressing their view and concerns about the current economic situation, but there is no evident contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 202.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named President Evans.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 203.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As gloomy as our last meeting was, conditions have deteriorated substantially further since then.  Practically all of my contacts reported that economic events had turned sharply lower once again in the last three to five weeks.  This goes well beyond the auto sector and other parts of the District that have been struggling for some time.  The most optimistic comment from my directors was this, “At least Iowa is going to hell slower than everywhere else.”  [Laughter]  It is tough to follow that accounting joke, you know—that was good.  More seriously, the most optimistic theme I heard from a number of business contacts went something like this, “We are conserving cash and furiously cutting costs by year-end.  But we hope to pause in the first quarter and take stock of where conditions appear to be heading.  Then, we will act accordingly.”  Frankly, I doubt such a wait-and-see pause in cost-cutting will occur that soon. For the purposes of this meeting and our actions over the next few months, I agree with the main thrust of the Greenbook projection.  We are facing large contractions in the next two quarters, and I don’t expect to see meaningfully positive growth before the fourth quarter.  I think we need substantial further accommodation after today’s meeting.  I see the timing and the size of those actions for the most part being shaped by the large recessionary forces in train and the enormous financial headwinds. The disinflationary forces in play clearly are strong, but currently I do not expect that they will prove large enough to generate outright deflation.  In terms of my earlier question about the Greenbook forecast—as I understand the way it was put together—if the quantitative easing helps, monetary policy would be somewhere between the funds rate at zero and the optimal control.  So, in fact, it would be a little better than I first suspected.  Inflation would be somewhat above that path.  That might be a useful benchmark to watch for if we are fortunate enough for the forecast to be that stable, but time will tell. Quantitative easing should also lead to an increase in the monetary base.  I don’t know if there was any lasting conflict between your comments and President Lacker’s, but I think that what we have contemplated will lead to the base increasing and that will generate expectations about inflation beyond just Taylor-rule dynamics, I would guess.  In fact, there is certainly a lot of discussion and criticism out there that our balance sheet is going to lead to large inflationary risks.  I don’t share that, given how I think we will unwind the programs.  But that certainly would help, and it would move us in that direction.  So I will keep an open mind on deflationary risk.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, Mr. Evans expresses disagreement with the idea of a "wait-and-see pause in cost-cutting" and advocates for further accommodation by the Federal Reserve. He also discusses potential inflationary risks and expresses an open mind on deflationary risk.


Passage number 204.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named President Stern.


Passage number 205.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, as just about everyone has said—and I certainly agree—the near-term outlook is grim.  Virtually all the anecdotes of any consequence that I have received recently have been negative.  Payroll employment has been, obviously, dropping significantly; and if you look at the trajectory, if that kind of trajectory continues for any length of time beyond the next month or so, it will surpass the declines in employment that we typically have seen, certainly in the last three recessions. My outlook for the real economy for the next five or six quarters has essentially the same profile as the current Greenbook.  I do have a somewhat better recovery starting in the second or third quarter of 2010, but at this point I have to admit that it is more hope than conviction.  It is based on a diminution of many of the factors that are currently restraining the economy and producing the significant contraction that is under way. As far as the inflation outlook is concerned, I don’t have quite as much disinflation as the Greenbook does, but I wouldn’t say that we are all that far apart at this point.  One footnote to that:  I do get a lot of comments and questions along the lines that President Evans mentioned—“Gee, with that expansion in your balance sheet, with all those reserves, aren’t we going to have a lot of inflation in the future.”  Maybe I ought to say “yes” to that question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the near-term outlook being grim and acknowledges the negative trends in employment. They also express hope for a recovery in the future and mention a potential increase in inflation, but do not disagree with the overall assessment in the Greenbook.


Passage number 206.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions "President Bullard" without providing any additional information or context, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 207.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be brief.  In the Eighth District, there is a clear and sharp downturn, as in the national picture.  There is a clear turn to survival strategies, and you really see that when key CEOs and other figures start talking about lower capital expenditures for 2009, cutting the lower levels in 2008 in half or more.  I think that’s very consistent with the Greenbook.  The effects on our District from any auto restructuring may be substantial, and that is something I have ratcheted up here in the last few months.  A common theme among all contacts—and it echoes some of what has been said around the table here—is that rate cuts at this point will have no effect on the macroeconomy.  Their thinking is, well, of course, since short-term Treasuries are trading at zero—I think one-month Treasuries actually hit zero here a bit ago—they are not going to have any effect.  But as Governor Duke pointed out yesterday, and I think this is an important concern, the impact on bank profitability may be substantial, exactly at the wrong time.  First Vice President Cumming picked that up, too.  I think that is a concern.  I think it suggests favoring an option of de-emphasizing the federal funds rate as a target at this meeting, as we will get to in the policy discussion.  But then you might not trigger this prime rate cut that would otherwise normally accompany a major move by the Fed. On the national picture, I expect a sharp downturn in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.  Expectations are extremely negative now and extremely fluid.  I think that is probably the biggest factor facing us going forward into 2009.  The expectations are so fluid that they portend a deflationary environment if we do not control the situation very soon.  I am also very concerned about the global aspect because we haven’t really seen this kind of coordination across the globe in the rapid movement to probably zero interest rates.  I don’t think we really know what that means going forward.  We are going to be looking at bad news coming in at least until summer, and we have no way at this point to signal a reaction to that bad news via normal policy.  That is the gravity of the situation, and in some ways it is the downside of a preemptive policy.  Had I been on the Committee earlier this year, I would have supported the preemptive policy to try to avoid this situation.  But one downside of it is that you do not have the ability to continually react as bad news comes in. In sum, I think we are moving to a Japanese-style deflationary, zero nominal interest rate, situation at an alarming pace.  To stay in the game and control expectations, we need a Volcker-like transformation, something like—although the situation is different—the ’79 announcement, which knocked private-sector priors off the idea that they should trigger all reactions to announcements on nominal interest rates.  You need a dramatic move that emphasizes this new reality.  Continued focus on the federal funds rate at this point would not face that reality.   Above all, we have to establish in the minds of the private sector—and maybe in our own minds as well—that we control medium-term inflation.  We should take the attitude that we can create the inflation we need to stay near target by one means or another.  I think, actually, this may be an excellent time to set the inflation target, although it sounds as though we are drifting away from that.  But if I can argue for it for a few minutes here, I think it might have an important effect on the navigation through the recession during 2009.  Of course, in normal times, to undertake some action like that, we would want a lot of study, and we would want to have time to talk it through with the Congress and other interested parties, as we would for interest on reserves.  But we don’t have that luxury right now.  We want to take the action now to help control the situation, and I think we could sell that as a work in progress, which can be modified later.  But we do want to keep these expectations under control in this very fluid situation.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the idea of continuing to focus on the federal funds rate and instead suggests de-emphasizing it as a target. They also argue for a dramatic and transformative move to control expectations and establish control over medium-term inflation.


Passage number 208.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a short expression of gratitude from someone named President Fisher. It does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 209.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  President Rosengren talked about micro behavior, and at the beginning, First Vice President Cumming talked about the hunkering-down mentality.  I have been focused on the microeconomic behavioral responses to our current situation.  As one of my CEO contacts outside my region said, we are basically all, in his words, “chasing the anvil down the stairs,” and that is that the behavioral responses of both businesses and consumers are driving us into a slow-growth cul-de-sac and a deflationary trap. One CEO I talked with was quite pleased that he could borrow $40 million over the weekend for a total of $250.  That is great from a commercial paper standpoint; he is an A1/P1 issuer.  However, were he to go to the longer-term debt markets, it would cost him 7½ percent.  So they can finance their daily operations easily.  But in terms of their long-term planning, they and others are responding—and I see this uniformly across my contacts—out of concern about the high cost of debt and the spreads over Treasuries, by doing what any businesswoman or businessman would do.  They are planning on less cap-ex, and they are cutting back on their plans for acquisitions of the weak, which they would like to take advantage of under the current circumstances.  They are also responding to the situation by cutting back on head count.  So, Chris, there is very much a hunkering-down mentality, not just in my District but across the country.  That leads to further economic weakness—that plus the fact that they are chary about issuing and paying for things with shares in a very weak market.  I am hearing more and more worries about their pension liabilities and how they are going to be able to finance those.  Obviously this is leading to the kind of economic behavior that none of us would like to see. On the consumer side, you see a similar behavioral pattern.  It seems that after Black Friday, according to my sources, there was weaker behavior than one had expected.  The spending pulse data that I get from one of the large credit card companies reflect what one would expect under these circumstances—that is, a shift to nonbranded products, smaller purchases of items, a rotation out of credit cards to debit cards and cash payments according to the pay cycle, and overall an expectation, on both the business and the consumer side, that things will get cheaper if they wait longer and they postpone either their cap-ex or their consumer purchases. The one ray of sunshine that I was able to find is that one large law firm, Cravath, has announced that it is not increasing its billing rates in 2009, [laughter] and other law firms are actually planning to respond by cutting their billing rates.  One woman whom I know summarized it this way:  “This is the divorce from hell.  My net worth has been cut in half, but I am still stuck with my husband.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the microeconomic behavioral responses of businesses and consumers and how they are leading to a slow-growth cul-de-sac and a deflationary trap. The speaker also mentions the hunkering-down mentality and provides examples of how businesses are planning for less cap-ex and cutting back on acquisitions and headcount. Similarly, consumers are shifting their behavior by purchasing nonbranded products and making smaller purchases. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention between different viewpoints.


Passage number 210.
”  [Laughter]   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "[Laughter]" and "Thank you" suggests a positive and agreeable atmosphere.


Passage number 211.
   MR. KOHN.  I am not going to even try to top either of those anecdotes or jokes.  I agree certainly with the thrust of the comments around the room.  The economy is in a steep decline.  There was a break in confidence somewhere in September that took what had been a gradual decline in employment, production, and output and made it much, much, much, much steeper.  The feedback loop between the financial markets and the real economy just intensified—turned up many, many notches at that time.  Households and businesses, as President Fisher was remarking, are very worried, and they are acting in a way to protect themselves.  They have cut back on spending, and they have cut back on lending.   I think the response of businesses is particularly interesting.  They responded very, very rapidly to the falloff in demand with cuts in employment and production.  So we are not even getting the sort of automatic stabilizer effect that we usually get from a buildup in inventories and a bit of labor hoarding as demand drops.  Thus businesses’ actions are just accentuating the weakness.  As many have remarked, the weakness is global, everywhere, including in emerging-market economies where, as Shaghil showed us, the inflow of capital has slowed substantially.  There is no real region to lead the globe out of this swamp we are in. Financial markets remain very strained.  I think of particular concern are the securitization markets.  When they are not operating, a lot of credit to households and businesses won’t be available at the same time that the banks are tightening up very sharply.  We have seen in these charts that household and business borrowers with anything less than very high credit scores are just finding credit either extraordinarily expensive or unavailable.  As a consequence, a very sizable output gap has opened up.  I think we can see that the decline is going to remain steep for some time.  The multiplier–accelerator effects of the drop in demand we have seen over the last couple of months have to feed back through consumption and investment.  I don’t think we have seen the full effect of the tightening in credit conditions and the decline in wealth from the end of September on. You can see the continuing economic decline in the initial claims data, the weekly IP, and the anecdotes we heard around the table on sales; and financial markets are going to remain impaired for a while despite our best efforts to open them up.  There are huge losses in the capital of intermediaries to absorb, so folks will be very cautious about making loans.  As long as investors, savers, households, and businesses see the economy in steep decline, the fear that is gripping the financial markets and the economy isn’t going to abate very rapidly. Inflation is decelerating across a broad front, and that is going to continue.  Economic slack will be increasing, cost pressures will be abating, and the ability to pass through cost increases will be highly constrained.  So far, longer-term inflation expectations seem to have been reasonably well anchored, though they are very hard to measure.  But I agree with President Bullard that we are going to need to watch this very, very closely for signs of a disinflationary dynamic taking hold.  I think what happens to the economy and inflation over the latter part of next year is extremely uncertain.  We have huge changes in forecasts in very short periods of time, and I suspect, like the staff, that the improvement in financial markets and the rebound in the economy will be gradual, in part reflecting the limited power of monetary policy.  But even if we thought that a sharper rebound next year was a distinct possibility, I don’t think it would matter very much for our policy purposes here today.  The trajectory, the economic decline, the extent of the output gap, and the degree of disinflation in train all imply that our task at this time is to try to limit economic weakness.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the comments and observations of others in the room and presents their own analysis and opinions on the state of the economy.


Passage number 212.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage consists of a simple expression of gratitude towards Governor Warsh.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 213.
  MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Several quick points.  First, the latest leg of deterioration, which began in mid-September, is showing few signs of abating, as Governor Kohn suggested.  I think the November retail sales data look like a head fake.  Revisions to September and October, as the Greenbook suggested, make us think that November was probably worse and December worse still.  So in some ways I think our job is difficult because the weakness seems to be accelerating. Globally, the deterioration is found everywhere.  The data are playing catch-up.  I am less optimistic that foreign activity will perform as well as the Greenbook suggests and that foreign activity will respond in 2010 because of lags in policy response and less flexibility in their labor markets, their product markets, and their political markets.  The depth and the degree of the fall in data and policymakers’ expectations overseas, particularly in Asia, are remarkable, shocking even, and I think we are likely to see policy responses there that are hard to judge but are likely to be changing pretty quickly. In terms of U.S. households, real household net worth has collapsed about 15 percent or so through the end of the third quarter—more than in 2001 and more than in 1974.  Ongoing declines in financial markets and house prices are likely to depress wealth further in the fourth quarter and beyond.  So-called savings from lower energy prices look as though they pale in comparison to what else is happening to U.S. household balance sheets.  As we have discussed before, every asset everywhere in the world is being revalued, and households are feeling it. In terms of financial markets, I will underscore what Dan suggested and what Bill suggested yesterday—the significant overall deterioration in conditions.  We all have a tendency at this point in the year to say, “Well, there are a lot of year-end effects, and we are not going to really know until we get through this period.”  We have had baby versions of year-end effects in the quarter-end effects in almost every meeting that we have had, and I have been a little dismissive of those.  I would say that there does appear to be more year-end stuff going on in these markets than there has been since this period of weakness began.   If you think about the two former investment banks that have balance sheets and year-ends that close at the end of November, this is the last quarter in which they will have that.  They have had more demands and more interest in, in effect, renting out their balance sheet as their customers’ balance sheets end in December than they ever have had.  The prices that are being paid for them to rent their balance sheets—to take exposures off the balance sheets of their clients—suggest that maybe, just maybe, the year-end effects are more significant this time than they were in the previous six or seven quarters.  It doesn’t give me a ton of optimism, but in January, market functioning could look a little better, and I think that would be the best news we have seen for a while.  You have heard me say before that, until we see market functioning improving and until we see these markets clearing, it is unrealistic to expect the real economy to turn.  I still think that is true. Turning to two final items, inflation and the fiscal package—on the inflation front, although there are risks in this environment for prices to fall below those consistent with price stability, I still believe that these risks are not likely to materialize in the medium term.  So I take stock of, but ultimately discount, the Greenbook’s deflation alternative simulation.  On the fiscal front, more, bigger, faster is what is going to happen inevitably to what I would describe as the first fiscal package of 2009.  The trillion dollar number over two years, which is now being bandied about, is larger than the Greenbook forecast and looks almost assured, with a greater share going to the states in my view than in the Greenbook forecast, more toward public infrastructure, perhaps less toward tax cuts on a relative basis than in the Greenbook, but bigger.  I would be surprised if that initial package isn’t supplemented through larger annual appropriations and another stimulus package, if not by the end of 2009 then by 2010.  As a result, my own sense would be that the 2010 deficit is likely to be significantly larger than the Greenbook forecast.  Now, knowing the precise contours of this fiscal package is tough.  I would say the only good news is that the duration of the slowdown is likely to suggest that the fiscal package may end up being somewhat more permanent in its incentives and somewhat more permanent in its effects; and I suspect, because of that, it is likely to provide some good news to the economy.  But I wouldn’t expect that to happen in the next twelve or eighteen months, other than perhaps a bit of benefit on the arithmetic.  In terms of changing the overall contour, pace, and strength of the resilient economy, I would say that is still quite a way off.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses skepticism about the Greenbook's optimistic outlook and suggests that the weakness in the economy is accelerating. They also express doubt about the effectiveness of policy responses in foreign markets. Additionally, the speaker disagrees with the idea that lower energy prices will have a significant impact on U.S. household balance sheets. Finally, the speaker expresses uncertainty about the impact of the fiscal package and suggests that the 2010 deficit will be larger than forecasted.


Passage number 214.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards Governor Kroszner.


Passage number 215.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Thanks.  President Lockhart’s forecast about what members would say about the forecasts I think has turned out to be right, and I certainly don’t want to disappoint.  [Laughter]  So I agree with what others have said, and I think most everything has been said about the intensification of the recessionary flames around the world.  What I will do is just quickly look at it from the perspective of part of the banks’ balance sheets and the things that may not be left on those balance sheets, to just underscore how I think this is going to be protracted for the financial services sector for a while. On the consumer side, as many people have mentioned, the very sharp step down in employment, the very large job losses, the increases in the unemployment rate, and the decreases in wealth have been leading to very significant increases in consumer delinquencies and very high roll rates—that is, people who become delinquent rolling directly into charge-off.  This is happening not only on the credit card side and on a lot of different parts of the consumer side but also in mortgages, for which we are seeing exactly the same kind of thing.  Although the most recent numbers that came out from the Mortgage Bankers Association suggested some stabilization in foreclosure starts, that actually had more to do with the laws in various states slowing down that process rather than any real change in the underlying economics.  Of course, we still have a lot of option ARM types of resets that will be coming through in 2009.  So a lot of pressure is there, and as was mentioned, housing prices are still going down. We haven’t yet seen as much of an actual downturn in commercial real estate, but undoubtedly that will occur as fewer people are shopping in shopping malls and as a lot of other commercial real estate projects don’t have the payoffs that people expect.  Also, an enormous amount of refinancing is going to be necessary during the next few months, and having to pay an additional 600 or 800 basis points really changes the economics of a lot of these projects, if they can even get the refinancing at an additional 600 to 800 basis points.  For leveraged loans, another piece of the balance sheet, as people have said, there is very little activity going on in takeovers.  The only positive there is that the failure of certain deals has taken some of the pressure off certain banks’ balance sheets. On the commercial and industrial side, as we have noted, the investment-grade market for debt issuance seems to have maintained itself, but that is really one of the few markets that is there.  If any challenges come in there, it could be very, very difficult for firms to finance investment.  We certainly have seen the spreads going up recently, even if the volume has come back a bit.  But as we have seen in the non-investment-grade part, the spreads have blown out, and the financing is not there.  That tends to be a little more of what many banks have on their balance sheets, and so I think that is representative of the challenges that the banks are going to have.  That suggests that we have a lot of challenges in banking and financial institutions’ balance sheets to come that have nothing to do with any particular level of assets or accounting issues but just real economic factors that are going to be affecting the balance sheets.  So the credit headwinds are going to be very, very strong for a number of quarters going forward. The points that President Rosengren made are extremely important ones.  We have to think about, as we move to the zero lower bound, how that is going to affect behavior of financial institutions.  Certainly, the staff memos were good on addressing some issues, but I think that other things that have been mentioned, like imposing minimums or floors on interest rates on loans, we have not carefully analyzed or really understand well.  There may be a variety of other responses that we don’t understand well that we really do need to get a better handle on, both to see how the effects of traditional monetary policy change—the transmission mechanism—and to think about the nontraditional aspects of monetary policy that we would be undertaking by using our balance sheet.  So where can we use it most effectively.  If the financial institutions are changing their behavior, we need to be cognizant of that and think about where we need to try to unfreeze markets if we are going to be using our balance sheet in that way, and I think it is very important that we do so. I will underscore also what other people have said about the great importance of clearly articulating what we are doing.  It is not that we have given up and that the Fed is impotent but that, through changes in our balance sheet, we can be quite potent in particular markets and in general.  That then brings us to whether we can be too potent and raise inflation concerns.  Exactly as President Stern said, we should be so lucky to have that as our problem.  We do need to make sure that we maintain credibility and show that we feel that we can and do act to offset concerns about deflation.  It is very difficult to tell what the price-level evolution is likely to be over the next year, but I do think that there is a real concern about that, and we have to take that very, very seriously going forward.  I think we would, obviously, be able to get out of these different programs, and we need to think about getting out of them at some point.  But right now the key is getting into the programs, using the nontraditional approaches, to make sure that we offset a deflationary psychology that could develop.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker primarily agrees with what others have said and emphasizes the challenges and concerns facing the financial services sector. They also highlight the importance of clearly articulating the actions taken by the Fed and addressing potential inflation concerns.


Passage number 216.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "Thank you, Governor Duke" is simply expressing gratitude towards Governor Duke.


Passage number 217.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yesterday I talked about the income statement of the banks.  I would like to talk a bit about the balance sheets now.  Up to this point, for the small and medium-sized community banks, it has been pretty much business as usual.  But now even those banks are finding it increasingly difficult to lend.  Community banks and regional banks are trying, but it is tough.  Funding is tight and expensive.  It costs 3½ percent to keep a CD and 4 percent and up to attract one.  The smaller banks are especially bitter about pricing against Citi and those nonbanks that have recently converted to bank holding company and thrift holding company charters. For a bank to qualify for TARP funding, the examiners are raising the bar on noncore funding.  One bank reported a meeting with both the OCC and the Fed in which the OCC criticized, and the Fed defended, the bank’s use of the discount window.  Examiners are raising the bar on capital:  12 is the new 10 on risk-based capital.  Borrowers are not in nearly as good shape as they were.  The best credits are choosing not to borrow, and they are adjusting their plans so that they get through on their own cash flow.  So the requests coming into the banks are more and more likely to be desperation requests—loans to cover operating losses or to meet payroll.  Cracks are appearing in C&I loans.  Some banks are exiting loans to entire industries, especially auto dealers, marine and construction trades, and retail.  The performance of commercial real estate, especially retail properties, is deteriorating.  Hospitality is falling off rapidly, and office buildings are expected to be next.  Apartments are still okay, and all of this is in addition to problems with construction loans.  Lower mortgage rates are helping refinance, but it is not the best time of the year to judge what it is going to happen with purchase activity.  There are still issues with jumbos, with down payments, and with requirements for very high credit scores. As we have talked here, it occurs to me that perhaps the traditional tools of monetary policy are all directed at bank credit, and the strongest nontraditional tools that we have are addressed more to the securitization markets—the TALF and the purchase of GSEs.  In this instance, most of the problems are not really caused by a cutback in bank lending but a complete collapse of the securitization markets, and so that is why these tools may be more necessary. I asked questions also about the TARP capital and got different reactions.  Several bankers said that they didn’t need it, they were scared off by the ability of the Congress to change the terms at any time, and they had elected not to take it.  Some took it because they thought they could leverage it into good business.  Some took it as cheap insurance.  Some took it to be in a position to acquire in what they see as the necessary weeding out of weaker players, and they think that should happen sooner rather than later.  Several complained about delays in providing terms for smaller banks.  Every single bank was adamant about the evils of mark-to-market accounting and other-than-temporary impairment.  There is a big diversion between market losses and credit losses, so that leads to bankers who are afraid to buy securities because they are worried about further marks as the markets go down.  But they are also unwilling to sell securities because they don’t believe that the current market price adequately reflects the potential credit losses.  There is some speculation that the mark-to-market losses will absorb all of the TARP capital that was just injected, and I think that is something we might want to calculate as fourth-quarter reports come out.  Then, the next big writedown is on servicing portfolios as lower rates spur refinancing activities.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a description of the current difficulties faced by banks and the impact on lending and the economy.


Passage number 218.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  And thanks, everyone, for a very concise but also very informative roundtable.  Why don’t we take a coffee break until 11:30.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude and a suggestion to take a break.


Passage number 219.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions for Brian.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states "Thank you" and then indicates that there are questions for Brian, specifically President Lacker.


Passage number 220.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, the first sentence in alternative B says, “The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent.”  In the staff analysis of various options for implementing interest on excess reserves, I think option 4 was the one that is closest to the reality of what we are implementing now—just a straight interest rate on excess reserves and an overprovision of reserves to drive it down to the floor.  In that analysis, the staff anticipated that it would be a floor, which it turned out not to be.  But it anticipated that, with that floor in place, the effective funds rate would generally be above the floor, and it envisioned choosing a rate on excess reserves ¼ point below our target rate.  So do you envision in this that we would have to take any measures if suddenly the downward forces on the effective rate would bring the funds rate above ¼.  Or is this just under the supposition that it would take a while and that it is unlikely to get above ¼.  You see, back in the early analysis there were forces that you believed would lead it above ¼, so I am wondering how you are thinking about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is seeking clarification and asking questions about the implementation of interest on excess reserves.


Passage number 221.
 MR. MADIGAN.  President Lacker, the forces that we were thinking would bring it above ¼ were largely a risk premium—the difference between federal funds, which have some amount of credit risk, and deposits at the Federal Reserve, which of course do not.  I think we would not anticipate that we would need to do anything very different from what we have been doing—just continue to provide a very large amount of reserves, which is a byproduct of our liquidity provisions.  With the interest rate on balances set at ¼ percent, that configuration of balances and rates would result in a federal funds rate somewhere in the range of 0 to ¼.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their perspective and explaining their reasoning.


Passage number 222.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Well, the reason I ask is that I am a little hesitant to set an upper bound on a range without understanding what sort of mechanism we would have for making that credible.  That is why I asked about that.  Two more questions.  One, the word “zero”—can you help me understand the thinking about why we should be a little averse to using that word.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing hesitation and asking for clarification and understanding. There is no opposing viewpoint being presented.


Passage number 223.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Well, one reason might be that, if you gave some weight to the view that very low interest rates do have costs in financial markets and you wanted to preserve some rhetorical or substantive leeway, you would want to have a somewhat positive interest rate, to the degree that you could achieve one, but still a low level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 224.
  MR. LACKER.  Okay.  One final question.  We, in the late 1970s, adopted a set of guidelines regarding agency debt and modified that in the late 1990s.  I don’t have a copy with me.  I think the latest adoption of that was January 2003, and I believe it is permanent.  I think it is still in effect.  I think it states that our purchases are not intended to channel funds to any specific sector.  I am wondering about the staff’s interpretation of the consistency between our GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS purchases, and that guidance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and seeking clarification on a specific topic.


Passage number 225.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I do have that guideline here, and you are correct, President Lacker.  The first paragraph of the guideline says that System open market operations in agency issues are an integral part of open market operations, designed to influence bank reserves, money market conditions, and monetary aggregates.  The second paragraph says that open market operations in those issues are not designed to support individual sectors of the market or to channel funds into issues of particular agencies.  As you remembered, in my briefing yesterday I did raise the question as to Committee members’ views of the allocation of funds to particular firms or sectors.  It is possible that the Committee may want to modify, suspend, or repeal this guideline at some point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information and stating the possibility of modifying or repealing a guideline.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 226.
 MR. LACKER.  They do seem inconsistent, though, and I think it is something, Mr. Chairman, that we ought to consider.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is disagreement or contention. This is evident from the phrase "They do seem inconsistent, though" which suggests that there is a conflicting or contrasting viewpoint being expressed.


Passage number 227.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Noted.  I think I am somewhat at fault here.  I did consult with everyone on the Committee and discussed what we were going to do.  I would say that, going forward, we should probably bring all such plans to the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges their own fault and suggests a solution for the future.


Passage number 228.
 MR. LACKER.  Thanks.  It would be good to have that public.  It is a public document, is it not.  Or it is not a public document yet.  It is on the Committee records, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Lacker is seeking clarification about the document's status as a public document. There is no expression of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 229.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I believe it is public.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting perspectives or disagreement. It simply states Mr. Madigan's belief without any contrasting viewpoints.


Passage number 230.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  It would be nice to have that in conformance with what we are actually doing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage indicates agreement between Mr. Lacker and the Chairman. Mr. Lacker expresses appreciation for the Chairman's response.


Passage number 231.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "President Fisher" does not provide any information or indication of a disagreement.


Passage number 232.
  MR. FISHER.  May I ask two questions, please.  With regard to alternative A, I am curious, Brian, as to how you think the bankers would respond to that in terms of their pricing behavior and loans and prime.  Second, our friend from the New York Desk, how do you think the markets might respond to alternative A—not overnight, by the way, which I couldn’t care less about, but over the longer term.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply asking two questions for clarification and seeking opinions.


Passage number 233.
 MR. MADIGAN.  On the former, just a guess, I would think that without any target federal funds rate—and given the well-known issues that we have been discussing about pressures on banks—it is possible that the prime rate would not be reduced by the full extent of the implicit reduction in the money market conditions that the FOMC would be targeting.  But I don’t really have a good sense as to what would happen quantitatively.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 234.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think the market will be slightly confused, but I think they will figure it out quite quickly.  They will scan the document and figure out, well, what does this really mean.  They will be surprised by the magnitude of the interest rate reduction.  As I said yesterday, most of the dealers are clustered around a 50 basis point reduction in the target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Dudley expresses his belief that the market will be initially confused but will quickly figure out the implications of the document. He also mentions that there may be surprise regarding the magnitude of the interest rate reduction.


Passage number 235.
 MR. FISHER.  Even though we are not stating a specific target, it would be implicit in the change in the level of the discount rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact without expressing any opposing views or contradictory statements.


Passage number 236.
 MR. DUDLEY.  We are saying here that we are at exceptionally low levels of the funds rate for some time.  I think they will understand that this is it and that the funds rate is going to be very, very low.  Obviously, the next day you will probably observe a federal funds rate that is no more than a couple of basis points, would be my guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Dudley is expressing his belief that the funds rate will remain very low.


Passage number 237.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "Thank you" does not indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 238.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in the given passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 239.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Just a follow-up on that.  I am a little confused that we don’t set a target but we are operating under an interest on reserves scheme by which we pay a deposit rate, which in fact we just lowered.  Is there some kind of disconnect between what is in alternative A, paragraph 5—lowering the discount rate and the interest rates on reserves—and not noting a change in the target rate when, in fact, we have already established that the deposit rate is going to be the target rate.  So I am confused.  Maybe the markets will see through this, but I don’t know.  I am not quite sure I understand what is going on and how this would work, in terms of communications or interpretations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is expressing confusion and disagreement with the approach being taken regarding interest rates and the target rate. He believes there is a disconnect between the actions being taken and the communication of those actions to the markets.


Passage number 240.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think the markets would look at this as saying it is a substantial rate cut.  The funds rate has been trading soft to the interest rate on excess reserves by a considerable margin.  The interest rate on excess reserves was cut considerably, so they will figure out that, therefore, the funds rate is going to trade at an exceptionally low level.  But you are right—it will not be quite as straightforward as putting it out there right up front.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Dudley is simply explaining how the markets would interpret a rate cut and acknowledging that the situation may not be as straightforward as initially presenting it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 241.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I guess my trouble is that the Committee judged that it is not useful to set a specific target for the funds rate and yet this will be interpreted as that we reduced the target in effect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Plosser expresses trouble with the Committee's decision not to set a specific target for the funds rate. This indicates a disagreement or contention as he believes the decision will be interpreted as effectively reducing the target.


Passage number 242.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We can discuss this in the go-round.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply suggesting a discussion in the future.


Passage number 243.
 MR. EVANS.  May I just ask Bill Dudley if he could describe how he anticipates his operations would differ between alternative A and alternative B.  How would you do things differently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking Bill Dudley to describe the differences between two alternatives and how his operations would change.


Passage number 244.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think we wouldn’t do things differently to any meaningful degree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MR. DUDLEY simply states his opinion that they would not do things differently in any significant way.


Passage number 245.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  I think it might be helpful to flag just a few things about which I would particularly appreciate the Committee’s advice.  The first is the issue that President Plosser was discussing, which is alternative A—not specifying a range or a target—or alternative B—specifying a range.  I think that the argument for specifying a range is that it seems a little clearer.  If you look at, for example, the Japanese experience, even when they were in quantitative easing, they still had a target for the call rate, as I understand it.  There are some counter-arguments, which Governor Duke and others have raised, about the impact on banks and so on.  That is question number 1.  Question number 2—and this doesn’t preclude other points, of course—is that in paragraph 3 of alternative B, for example, we have bracketed just for your reference the risk of inflation’s declining below optimal levels.  I would be interested to know your views on whether or not to include that bracketed phrase.  Third—again looking at alternative B—in paragraph 4 we have the conditional statement that “weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate.”  A little informal polling suggested that people were sort of okay with this way of stating the conditionality.  But if there are any concerns about that or, alternatively, if you would like to include a reference to disinflation as one of the conditions, that is just something I want to flag as a question. A fourth and final point I want to flag—and President Yellen pointed this out to me—in paragraph 5 we have a sentence saying that “the Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.”  I think to put that in there we should feel that sometime in the next few meetings there is a significant chance that we would in fact engage in some kind of a program.  We don’t want to put it in there if it is a complete red herring. So those are four points that I have, but of course, you may have other questions or issues that you want to raise.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply the speaker presenting questions and asking for advice.


Passage number 246.
 MS. DUKE.  Mr. Chairman, just one response to President Lacker’s and President Plosser’s observations, which I think are related.  If you set the rate that we are going to pay for interest on reserves the same as the target rate for fed funds and the market does repair itself and resume, then you would expect there to be some risk spread over the rate that we are paying on interest on reserves.  So if we don’t set a target or we set the target something higher than the rate that we are paying, at least if the markets do start to resume, then the Desk isn’t in a position of then having to try to drive the rate back down again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is responding to observations made by President Lacker and President Plosser and is explaining their relatedness. They are discussing the possibility of setting the interest rate on reserves and the target rate for fed funds at the same level.


Passage number 247.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  All right.  Let’s begin the go-round.  We’ll begin with President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple and neutral statement indicating the start of a meeting or discussion.


Passage number 248.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  The bleak outlook calls for aggressive action.  With the effective federal funds rate already well below our target, there is a logic to moving to the floor at this meeting and redirecting attention to nontraditional policies.  Thus, I am comfortable with alternative B and would reduce the interest rates on required and excess reserves to 25 basis points. In terms of the questions that the Chairman just posed, I am comfortable specifying the range of 0 to ¼ percent.  I would actually keep the bracketed information.  I am okay with the conditionality.  I would remove the reference to the Treasury securities, and for the future I would certainly want to think about expanding the purchase of GSE and agency mortgage-backed securities beyond $600 billion.  Also I would support, at a future date, setting a target of 2 percent for the core PCE inflation rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, expresses his agreement and comfort with alternative B and suggests specific actions he would take regarding interest rates and purchasing securities.


Passage number 249.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a polite expression of gratitude to President Bullard.


Passage number 250.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Lacker.


Passage number 251.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the dismal state of the economy, and with the funds rate averaging around 1/8 percent anyway, I don’t see any reason to wait to bring the fed funds rate down to effectively zero.  I agree with the staff analysis that any dislocation of the money funds is likely to be minor.  My board put in for a 75 basis point cut in the discount rate.  When I looked over at my small bankers, I was afraid one of them was going to throw a shoe at me.  [Laughter]  I escaped that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Lacker's opinion and his reaction to the response he received from small bankers, without any conflicting viewpoints presented.


Passage number 252.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That is going around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The phrase "That is going around" does not provide enough context to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. It is a vague statement that could refer to gossip, news, or any other information circulating among a group of people. Without further information, it is not possible to determine if there is disagreement or contention involved.


Passage number 253.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Jeff, I just want to make a couple of comments.  A very small one is that, in an early draft, instead of saying “entail the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet” we had “entail increasing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.”  We thought that might not be appropriate because things go on and off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply mentions a small change made in an early draft, without any conflicting opinions or arguments being presented.


Passage number 254.
 MR. LACKER.  Other things pull it down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact that there are other factors that cause the mentioned thing to decrease.


Passage number 255.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  We were probably going to do that as a trend, maybe not day to day, but it has some of the flavor of increasing the base.  So that is one just observation.  On the TALF, we have added a presentation today from Bill Dudley and Pat Parkinson.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is simply stating some observations and mentioning that a presentation has been added. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 256.
 MR. LACKER.  Excellent.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is expressing gratitude for something.


Passage number 257.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Finally, on the directive, there is a bit of a difference, which is that I do think we need to bring new programs, et cetera, for your information, as I said before.  But this is actually a stronger statement in that it also means that we should report to you on the ongoing implications of existing programs for the base and for the balance sheet.  So there is a bit of a difference in those two concepts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply pointing out a difference between two concepts.


Passage number 258.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I do like the “increase” statement, and I think we could easily explain that we are looking at a partial differential effect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The statement expresses agreement and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 259.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  One possibility is “entail increasing the size.”  There is some risk there, but I think that would be the general trend that we are considering.  Others can comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 260.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think the real issue is what happens to the CPFF, what happens to the swap programs, and the take-up of the TAF.  Those are the three big elements, and they conceivably could run down in the first quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply presents a statement about the three big elements (CPFF, swap programs, and TAF) and their potential outcome in the first quarter. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 261.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You could say “increasing over time the size” or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "increasing over time the size" is being used simply as an example or suggestion, without any clear disagreement or opposition involved.


Passage number 262.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Or “likely to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "MR. DUDLEY. Or 'likely to'" is likely a continuation or clarification of a previous statement without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 263.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  That was the reason we switched.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage.


Passage number 264.
 MR. LACKER.  The statement doesn’t have to stand for the whole first quarter, does it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is asking a clarifying question about the duration of the statement, but there is no dispute or argument taking place.


Passage number 265.
 MR. DUDLEY.  No.  But I think the issue is that, because we have open facilities, we just can’t guarantee what their take-up is going to be relative to what they are today.  The swap lines are roughly $600 billion; those could come down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the uncertainty of the take-up of open facilities and the potential decrease in swap lines.


Passage number 266.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, each facility makes the balance sheet bigger than it otherwise would be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker simply states a fact about facilities making the balance sheet bigger.


Passage number 267.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  A lot of these could go down quite substantially if conditions improve, and we wouldn’t control that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a possibility that certain conditions could improve and result in a decrease in certain factors.


Passage number 268.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  That was the concern we had—that it wouldn’t necessarily be a monotonic increase, that it could have ups and downs depending on usage and so on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not expressing any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating a concern.


Passage number 269.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, I have in mind here the confusion that some around this table have reported hearing from the public about what we are doing with our balance sheet.  I think acknowledging that it is expanding in size would be an important feature.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply mentions that there is confusion among some people about the expansion of the balance sheet.


Passage number 270.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Well, we can hear from others about that as well.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that the speaker is open to hearing from others and potentially discussing a topic further.


Passage number 271.
   MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly agree that more accommodation is needed.  We need to take actions to provide, as best we can, the quantitative easing equivalent of the optimal control path as discussed in the briefing.  I am not sure ultimately how feasible that will be, but it is a good goal for us over the next few months. Now, in terms of the differences between alternative A and alternative B, as I understood Bill Dudley, there is no operational difference in these two options.  It really comes down to how we want to communicate with ourselves and also the public.  I tend to favor alternative B, certainly for now, and maybe alternative A later.  After all, if the funds rate is going to go to zero in reality, then alternative A might be the right language.  But we will have time to see that.  This is a reasonable sequencing.  The action today that we are dropping the funds rate target range 75 to 100 basis points is big, and certainly that will be the first thing that they see in the first line.  I think they will continue reading.  The language on the conditionality about the funds rate being exceptionally low is certainly okay today.  The language says, “The Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant.”  I guess there is some question as to whether or not we should include the dual mandate here—that disinflationary forces are also part of that.  I could go with the consensus there, but I would just raise that as a question.   Regarding the bracketed risk that inflation could decline for a time below optimal rates—the rates that we think are best—back in 2003 this is what got a tremendous amount of attention.  That is another reason that, as people read further, it could have a very large effect.  It seems to be accurate.  One way to deal with that would be to allow the minutes to capture that discussion, at least this time, and perhaps to put it in next time.  It depends on the accumulation of how many of these large noteworthy developments we want in the statement here.  I would be even more comfortable if that type of statement were accompanied by a context such as that we would be seeking conditions of inflation being around 2 percent.  I realize that this may not be the ideal time to include that without a more extended discussion.  But I would be okay with the bracketed information, if that is the consensus.   I think we should probably omit the Treasury purchases if we don’t think that we are going to do that by March.  Certainly, omitting it today is low cost.  Given all the information, it is probably overload.   I am okay with the language in the directive.  Accompanying the language is all of the discussion about the collaboration that we have between the Board and the Committee generally, and so I have a very good feeling about that.  I think that it will tend to evolve as this goes on, whether or not it is maximum thresholds or just changing the composition of all of this.  So those are my preferences.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement and preference for certain options, but does not mention any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 272.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude towards Governor Kohn.


Passage number 273.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 274.
 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 275.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without the passage provided, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 276.
 MR. LACKER.  Just a thought in response to Governor Kohn’s comments:  Would the phrase “add to” do a better job than “increase the size of” in conveying the sense that these programs are going to make the balance sheet bigger than it otherwise would be, rather than lead to an absolute increase in the size of the balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a response to Governor Kohn's comments and a suggestion to use a different phrase for better clarity.


Passage number 277.
 MR. KOHN.  I am not sure those words help me, actually.  “Add to” sounds the same as “increase” to me.  I have missed the subtlety here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 278.
  MR. LACKER.  Other things held constant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states a statement without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 279.
 MR. KOHN.  Ceteris paribus.  We could put that in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "ceteris paribus" is a Latin term commonly used in economics to indicate that all other variables are held constant or remain the same. It does not introduce any disagreement or contention, but rather reinforces the idea of keeping other factors unchanged.


Passage number 280.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It is already Greek anyway.  [Laughter]  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is followed by laughter, suggesting that it is a lighthearted comment or joke.


Passage number 281.
   MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My preference is to move in this meeting to the consensus lower-bound range for the funds target, and I prefer the range of 0 to 25.  So I believe either alternative A or alternative B will work as serviceable options, and I can live with either one.  But I actually lean toward alternative B.  I think it is the clearest, and with the inclusion of the language related to deflation, it is also internally more consistent.  In particular, my preference is to indicate that the FOMC intends to keep the policy rate low until economic and credit conditions improve, and I think it is appropriate to emphasize that our policies will be calibrated based on longer-term inflation objectives. As I said yesterday, I am thinking that the conditionality language could be stronger.  Specifically, I have in mind something along the lines of a statement that reads that “the Committee intends to maintain this range for the federal funds rate until such time that it judges conditions are present for material and sustained improvements in financial market functioning and economic growth, and the Committee believes that this policy course is consistent with its medium-term price stability objective.”  I think that kind of language could fit at the beginning of paragraph 4, around that area, in alternative B.  I think that is stronger than the implicit conditionality that is already in the statement.  In my rounds of contacts before the meeting, one conversation did resonate with me.  It was a call from a financial market participant for hearing what the plan is and what the strategy is and affirming that there is a plan.  I think stronger conditionality language would respond to that need in the marketplace. As regards the questions, I think I have already covered some of them.  I would prefer the specifying of a range in alternative B.  I would lean toward including the language “and sees some risk that inflation could decline” because it ties in with the “all available tools” language at the beginning of paragraph 4.  In other words, I think, if we include that language in paragraph 3, we are setting up a risk and the “employ all available tools” responds strongly to that risk. Regarding the inclusion of the long-term Treasury securities, I am persuaded by Governor Kohn’s comment that we should include it.  It is consistent with whatever public discussion we have had to date, including your speech of two weeks ago.  So that is all.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their preferences and opinions, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict with others.


Passage number 282.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude followed by a mention of the title "President Yellen," indicating respect for the mentioned person.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 283.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think, at the end of the day, alternatives A and B really amount to the same thing in terms of policy.  So I could live with either, but on communication grounds, my own strong preference would be for B.  I think it is important at this juncture for the FOMC to state very clearly what it wants the federal funds rate to be, that we want it to remain close to zero, and I think we best do that by specifying explicitly a rate or, as it is, a range.  Both A and B eliminate the gap we have had between the target and the reality of where the funds rate is actually trading, but B eliminates that gap by embracing the current reality as desirable.   In contrast, it seems to me that A is saying that the Committee is all but helpless to affect the funds rate, so, after all, it would be a charade to set a target.  Then it kind of acknowledges, well, but, you know, the funds rate trading near zero is really not such a bad thing, given the weakness in the economy.  I think we have greater command over the funds rate’s destiny than alternative A suggests.  If the Board and the FOMC really wanted to push the effective funds rate up above zero, say to 50 or to 100 basis points, the Board could choose to raise the rates paid on reserves and the discount rate, and we could get it up, even though we have all of this enormous quantity of excess reserves and even though interest on reserves isn’t working in quite the way we expected.  I agree that it would be a bit odd to be setting the interest on reserves and discount rates above our target for the federal funds rate.  But it seems to me it could be done, and we are not powerless to accomplish it.  So I don’t like the suggestion that we are just helpless to move the funds rate.  I think we should say that we don’t want to move the funds rate up.  I don’t want it to trade above the 0 to 25 basis point errange.  I certainly don’t want that.  I think the forecast is grim.  I think we should go as low as we can as fast as we can without harming the functioning of money markets, so keeping the funds rate trading in the 0 to 25 range is desirable.  If it were to be the case, following President Lacker’s earlier question, that we suddenly saw the interest on reserves floor working better and fed funds started trading above 25—the funds rate could, for example, move up to 50 or so—I would hope that the Board would actually lower the interest rate paid on reserves to hold the funds rate in the 0 to 25 range.  So I think we should go down and do it decisively in one step today.   On the other matters, in alternative B, paragraph 3, I favor including the bracketed language suggesting that we expect and are not happy to see inflation declining below levels we consider consistent with price stability.  I agree with President Evans on the merits of doing that.  I like the forward-looking language from A that has been added in bold to B concerning the odds that we will keep the funds rate low for some time.  On the Treasuries, I am worried about making an announcement or giving a hint that we are not going to follow through on them pretty quickly.  I am personally in favor of and support buying longer-term Treasuries, and I haven’t heard a lot of opposition to it.  If we really are going to do it and do it pretty soon, I have no problem with including language to that effect.  But I don’t think we should throw a hint out there unless we intend to follow through.  With respect to the wording of the directive, I am happy with it.  With respect to the issue about the monetary base and increasing the size of our balance sheet, I would endorse Governor Kohn’s remarks on that topic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Yellen, expresses her disagreement with alternative A and argues in favor of alternative B. She believes that alternative B is better for clearly communicating the desired federal funds rate and states that she does not want the funds rate to trade above the 0 to 25 basis point range. Additionally, she expresses concern about the possibility of the interest on reserves floor not working and the funds rate moving above 25, suggesting that the interest rate paid on reserves should be lowered in that case to keep the funds rate in the desired range.


Passage number 284.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude to President Hoenig.


Passage number 285.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If we were still working with the framework of targeting the fed funds rate, I would prefer D, and I would accept C, and I would vote accordingly.  But I think what I’ve heard in the past two days is that we have really abandoned that framework, and this is kind of a ratification of that.  I think that our framework now is actually in A and B in the statement that we are going to “expand its purchases . . . as conditions warrant.”  If that’s the case, then going with A, in which you don’t set a fed funds rate or talk about it, is probably preferred. I also think that we’re now in a credit policy type of framework, and it bothers me.  I have a lot of sympathy for what Presidents Lacker and Bullard said.  I would prefer, rather than a statement that says “as conditions warrant,” that we have some kind of a monetary base criterion for the future.  This is something that we ought to think about.  At the same time, I do not think that we should have inflation below optimal in this statement.  I don’t think we’re there, and, at this point, I think it should not be hinted at. I think that “purchasing longer-term Treasury securities” goes with the conditionality statement anyway.  We’ll do what it takes, and if it takes purchasing longer-term Treasuries, that’s it.  That is what we have unless we go back and look at a new framework that we need to get out and talk about with the public, and I hope that as our meetings and our discussions progress, we begin to focus on that.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing his opinion and preferences regarding the framework and policies being discussed.


Passage number 286.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, as I said yesterday, this is a work in progress.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply states that the work is still in progress.


Passage number 287.
 MR. HOENIG.  I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker explicitly states that they agree with the statement or idea being discussed.


Passage number 288.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’ll keep working on it.  I didn’t quite get your proposal.  Do you propose leaving in the sentence about Treasuries at this meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply consists of a response to a proposal made by someone. There is no explicit contention or disagreement evident in the passage.


Passage number 289.
 MR. HOENIG.  If we’re going to have statements that say we’re going to purchase mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant, I don’t think “purchasing longer-term Treasury securities” is a much different step from that, so we can leave it in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Hoenig, is expressing agreement and suggesting that "purchasing longer-term Treasury securities" is not much different from the previous statement of purchasing mortgage-backed securities.


Passage number 290.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply begins with a word of agreement or acknowledgment ("Okay") and mentions President Pianalto without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 291.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Obviously, for us to counteract the powerful forces that are weakening our economy and financial markets, we should provide maximum monetary policy stimulus as quickly as possible, and conducting monetary policy on the basis of a fed funds rate target is no longer the best strategy.  I do think it is time and it would be helpful to begin focusing the public’s attention on the unconventional approach to monetary policy, and I think alternative A does a better job of doing that. What I like about alternative A is its straightforward characterization of the policy situation and how we plan to respond to it.  I support leaving in the language that is bracketed in alternative A, paragraph 2, about the risk that inflation could decline for some time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability.  The reason I say that is that we have been using the language that the Committee expects inflation to moderate for some time now, and given the discussion, I think we expect that situation to be getting worse.  So I would support leaving that in.  I would also leave in paragraph 3 the more forward-looking language about keeping the low level of the fed funds rate for some time.  I also would keep in the language on the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  I assume that the minutes that are released in three weeks are going to say that we discussed it and that we will be evaluating it.  So I would just leave it in.  Also, given the dire economic outlook that we are talking about and the aggressive response that we think monetary policy should take, I think just saying merely that we stand ready to expand the purchase of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities isn’t aggressive enough.  I do realize that there are a lot of important questions that are left unanswered, such as determining the mix of assets to purchase and how to know when enough is enough, and then how to shrink our balance sheet when the time comes.  But I do think that adopting alternative A is taking a big step in the direction of giving the public some indication of what we plan to do. Finally, I know you just said that we will come up with some language and some framework around what we are doing.  But as discussed in yesterday’s conversation, having some talking points even in the near term so that we are consistent in our language on what we are doing would be helpful.  At a time when there is a lot of confusion out there and markets are as fragile as they are, having us all talk about this in the same way would be helpful.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. MS. PIANALTO is expressing her support for alternative A and providing reasons for her support.


Passage number 292.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "Thank you" and the mention of President Stern do not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 293.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, as several people have observed—and I agree—I don’t think there’s any significant policy difference between A and B.  That’s certainly where I am.  From a communication point of view, I have a mild preference for B.  I think it’s a little clearer on the margin and would be helpful in that regard.  So I would work off B as to some of the issues and suggestions that have been raised. With regard to the first issue, I would not include the information in brackets in paragraph 3 at this point.  I think Governor Kohn made a good point that we’re likely to be much better positioned to do that in January in conjunction with the SEP and the longer-term projections.  Let me be clear.  I am in favor of inflation targeting, but I think exactly how and when we get to that is important.  So I wouldn’t want to do that simply in a casual way and do it too rapidly.   As I look at paragraph 3, I have a couple of other questions.  The first sentence says that “inflationary pressures have diminished quickly,” which is certainly true, but I think it may be more important that they have diminished appreciably.  So I would just make that point.  I might also say, rather than “the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters,” which I think is probably true, that you might just say “the Committee expects modest inflation in coming quarters.”  The reason I’m putting it that way is that I’m trying to get out of this point precisely about whether it is or isn’t going to run below what we think might be consistent with the dual objectives.   I think the conditionality in paragraph 4 is fine.  If there’s a good way to strengthen it, doing so would also be fine with me.  But trying to modify these things on the fly is always difficult.  Finally, I would include the thought about purchasing longer-term Treasuries.  I think we should, and because I think we should, I think we should say that.  So I guess that covers the topics I want to cover.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states his agreement on several points and presents his preferences and suggestions, but there is no conflict or disagreement with the others.


Passage number 294.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Maybe I should ask Bill.  Do you see any purely operational issues in the next few months if we decide to purchase longer-term Treasuries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is seeking input or advice from someone (Bill) regarding potential operational issues related to the purchase of longer-term Treasuries.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 295.
   MR. DUDLEY.  We can do it, but we’re under a strain.  As long as we don’t start until sometime in January, I think we could manage, as long as you don’t ask us to do it every day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Dudley acknowledges the possibility of doing something, but expresses concern about the strain it will cause. This indicates a disagreement or conflict between the speaker and the person they are addressing.


Passage number 296.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We won’t.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: This passage does not contain any statements or indications of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 297.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Every other day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the frequency of a certain event ("every other day").


Passage number 298.
 MR. DUDLEY.  How about once every couple of weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question about frequency.


Passage number 299.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only mentions the name "President Plosser" without providing any context or information about any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 300.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply consists of an expression of gratitude and a reference to "President Fisher."


Passage number 301.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, before I get started, I do think that President Plosser has raised good issues on the governance matter.  I hope that we will continue to discuss this, bearing in mind that there may be changes in the composition of the governors with a new President and given the faith that we built up with the existing governors, so that we have to get at least our lines of understanding clear as we go through time.  As to the alternatives that we face, the problem with the economy isn’t the interbank lending rate or even the riskless rate.  The problem with the economy and with the financial markets is that intermediation has broken down.  I think our actions should forcefully be directed toward the clearing of blockages in the financial plumbing and not just fiddling with the faucet.  It’s the availability and distribution of credit that is problematic.   In that sense I like alternative A.  In fact, President Stern, I like its ambiguity, and I’ll tell you why.  I am quite worried that stating zero to 25 basis points will bring down upon us the wrath of bankers.  I do think it’s important that community banks be profitable and that they be healthy.  First Vice President Cumming pointed this out in her comments, and to me this alternative gives us substantial wiggle room, as it were, in its ambiguity.  Vice Chairman Kohn pointed out that paragraph 5 is good for the bankers.  Without stating a specific target fed funds rate, it allows them to price their loans according to how they see fit.  That appears to be taking place anyway.  There is a separation between the fed funds rate and the prime loan rate.  So unless I’m missing something, bankers should positively interpret both paragraph 1 and paragraph 5 in terms of their operating leeway. I would suggest that this is an important step forward in making clear the way we’re going to operate henceforth.  It does indicate a regime change, and as President Bullard pointed out, I think we have to be forceful in doing so.  I could diddle with the language, but to be even more forceful I would transpose paragraph 4 and paragraph 3.  That is, the first two paragraphs strike me as fine.  At this juncture I would not put in an inflation target because I don’t think we’re prepared for it as a Committee.  I’m comfortable leaving in paragraph 2 that we see some risk that inflation could decline below optimal rates for a time.  After all, we just got the number that makes that very clear—minus 1.7 on the headline rate.  But then I would go immediately into what our focus is going to be.  I rather like President Plosser’s one edit to make clear that it’s the focus of the FOMC’s policy.  After we have laid that clear—and if, indeed, just parenthetically we are going to make some Treasury purchases, we should include that in there; if we are not, we should not—then in what would be paragraph 4, strike “in current circumstances” and say that “the Committee judged that it was not useful to set a specific target for the fed funds rate.”  You’re making it very clear that we have a regime change.  As to the content of paragraph 4, assuming we are going to be purchasing longer-term Treasuries, I’d leave it as it is.  Stay on message.  Repeat it over and over and over again.  You started with your speech in Austin, and that makes it operative.  I have no problem with it, and I would urge it be included as written. So my suggestions, in summary, are that we embrace alternative A; we transpose paragraphs 4 and 3; we take out the wording “in current circumstances” because obviously we’re judging things in current circumstances; and we not include an inflation target at this juncture but do include the rest of the bracketed language in paragraph 2.  I believe this is sellable to our bankers, and I believe it’s a good way to proceed.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and support for alternative A and providing suggestions for how to improve the wording of the statement.


Passage number 302.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President Cumming.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It only includes a statement expressing gratitude towards First Vice President Cumming.


Passage number 303.
 MS. CUMMING.  Yes, thank you.  Like others, I see the circumstances as requiring the most action we can take.  Therefore, I would favor alternative A somewhat over alternative B, but I could live with either.  I think that alternative A has the advantage, which President Bullard described and others have referred to, that it does signal a significant change in what we’re doing and draws attention to it.  If anything, it probably provokes more dialogue with us as a central bank, which I think at this point is a good thing. Turning to the next paragraph, I’m a bit concerned that inflation is, in fact, moderating very quickly.  This morning’s number for the total CPI is 1.1 percent.  That would lead me to ask whether we are expecting inflation to moderate or are, in fact, seeing inflation moderating.  This point is similar to President Stern’s.  That would also lead me to leave in the bracketed point about the future and the concern there because I think it’s better if we put it on the table than have people say, “Don’t they see that as a problem.”  To that end, I also want to endorse the kind of broad strategy statement that President Lockhart put forward.  I actually came into the meeting with a very similar sentence from my staff, really talking about what our goal is.  I think it does help to set the stage for what follows here, and this was a focus on improving conditions in financial markets or financial intermediation and ensuring a recovery in output and maintaining low inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal preferences and concerns, but there is no disagreement with others or argumentative language used.


Passage number 304.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m sorry.  What was the beginning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 305.
 MS. CUMMING.  I think that President Lockhart was proposing that it follow paragraph 2, perhaps in its own paragraph.  We would raise the question of the risk of too low inflation but then have the next paragraph really speak to what our goals would be, and I thought the sentence that you had sounded good.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and suggesting a potential addition to the proposal.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 306.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I can confuse the matter by saying that I was thinking of it in alternative B, and Ms. Cumming has it in alternative A.  So somewhere in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. This can be seen in Mr. Lockhart's statement that he was thinking of the matter in alternative B while Ms. Cumming has it in alternative A. This suggests a disagreement or difference in perspectives between the two individuals.


Passage number 307.
 MS. CUMMING.  Then continuing with this, I would comment on the next paragraph.  I’m very sympathetic to the idea that President Lacker was putting forward—that we somehow need to talk about our expectations about the size of the balance sheet.  I was going to offer one suggestion:  Perhaps for the “entail the use of” phrase in the first sentence of paragraph 4 we could substitute “sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at very high levels”—something that would indicate that we expect the balance sheet to remain really large but doesn’t talk about whether we’re increasing it from today.  Just a thought.  I would leave in the sentence on the longer-term Treasuries in large part because we have already talked about it publicly and the language here gives us the opportunity to evaluate and does not necessarily commit us to those purchases in the future.  In any case, we would need to explain whether or not we’re going to purchase longer-term Treasuries, having raised it already. On the directive, I would say that I am comfortable with the directives as written.  There might be room, if we found the right language for the size of the balance sheet, for inserting that sentence in here, for example, whatever we take from the first sentence of paragraph 4.  I also think that, as part of this monitoring that the System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will provide for the Committee, there really is the opportunity to develop much better disclosure of what the Committee is doing, what our balance sheet looks like, and what actions we’re taking—some kind of ongoing monitoring that could be shared with the public that I think would also be very helpful in explaining what the Federal Reserve is actually pursuing in the near term and what it is doing with the balance sheet. I was really impressed by something that President Lacker said yesterday, which is that—and I paraphrase—we are in uncharted waters but we are groping our way forward.  I think that it is a great metaphor for where, in fact, we are.  Some of these questions—such as what specific forward-leaning language we’d like to put in our statement over time and how we think about the monetary base versus the credit policy type of actions that we’re taking—are all things that I think we will continue to learn about and explore.  What I had put forward is that, as we come to understand them better, we have an opportunity to communicate with the public and help them understand better what we are, in fact, doing.  Thank you very much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a series of suggestions and thoughts from the speaker about how to communicate and provide better disclosure about the Federal Reserve's actions and balance sheet.


Passage number 308.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage consists of a simple expression of gratitude to Governor Warsh without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 309.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As others have said, the choice among these alternatives, particularly A, B, and C, is not really a choice about the effective rate.  It’s a choice about our clarity, our conviction, and maybe most important, our readiness in announcing a new regime.  As I described yesterday, I think the zero lower bound is not zero, and so there are risks particularly in these markets of going there or threatening to go there.  So the balance of my suggestions and edits come from the zero phobia.  [Laughter] First let me talk about C briefly.  Alternative C is a sort of way station.  It is our last chance to describe the old regime and to pivot to a new regime, whether the new targeted rate was 25 or 50 basis points.  But seeing that there doesn’t seem to be much interest in that, I won’t try to reconcile the music and lyrics of C, which announces a target and then says we’re going to miss it; but I had a couple of suggestions to try to bring that together.  So let me confine the balance of my remarks to the choice between A and B. I think in alternative A we are all-in.  It makes the new regime explicit.  It is likely to be somewhat of a surprise to markets and puts a large burden on all of us—particularly you, Mr. Chairman—not only in the next few hours but really for the next days and weeks in describing with great rigor what the new regime is.  I think we’re up to that, but it is certainly a tall task at a time of great uncertainty in markets.  The way I would try to make that task a little easier is through various channels—suggesting that we are in some ways revealing the new target in paragraph 5 by suggesting that the implied effective target is 25 basis points, given what our change is on the discount rate and the interest rate on reserves.  So that, I think, has a way of making the transition to the new regime less massive than it might be and reinforces my zero phobia point.  I think that’s one way in which the bold, new regime with a lot of explanation in the next few weeks can at least be not as scary to the markets in the next couple of days.  What about alternative B.  If we were to go in that direction, I’d make one modest suggestion.  In the first paragraph, I would insert the word “between”—so “the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate between zero and ¼ percent”—to suggest that you’re not going to be at that endpoint.  Now, I’ll admit that’s not a massive change, but it makes me feel a bit better about my phobia and about how markets, banks, and others might react knowing that that is a point you do not want to cross.  So a suggestion there. Now, on your open question, setting a range in terms of the optimal level of inflation or not, I’m not crazy about a range.  But if we have a range, I think it is scary, lurchy, to include it today, and so I wouldn’t do it.  Conditionality, I think, is fine.  I don’t feel strongly about our considering Treasury securities.  I do like Governor Kohn’s suggestion about deleting “to continue” because bold new regimes aren’t continuations of what we’ve done.  They’re bold and new.  So I think that’s an important change by Governor Kohn.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering their thoughts and suggestions on different alternatives and expressing their preferences, but there is no explicit disagreement with others or a conflicting viewpoint being presented.


Passage number 310.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude followed by a reference to Governor Kroszner.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 311.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  Obviously you have a bleak outlook.  It’s very important to act quickly and decisively, and I think it’s clear from the discussion that our choice is between A and B.  But as a number of people have mentioned, the economic substance is probably nearly identical in alternatives A and B.  Our exposition of it, though, can make a very big difference. There are an enormous number of moving parts, and there is a lot to digest.  We potentially have here, as I count them, seven new things that people have brought up.  That’s just an enormous amount to deal with, and I think some of them we want to delay.  The inflation target is very important, but it brings up issues here, and I’m not sure that we want to talk about something like that now.  So let me just quickly run through these. We have to think about the dynamic of what we are going to say next time.  What is this committing us to talk about.  First, the rate cut is one very big issue—75 versus 50 basis points.  Although some market participants think it will be 75, I think that will still be news, but I think it’s very important for us to move there.  Second, just moving to a range is something new; I think that is something that is actually quite newsworthy in and of itself.  Going to no target at all is extremely newsworthy, maybe too newsworthy to include with all these other things.  I think of this and the discussions that we’ve had as setting up an extremely valuable template for how we should be thinking about the statement and what we need to be explaining today as well as over the next few meetings.  So I would actually say that, given all of the moving parts and all of the changes, talking about a range either “between” or “of” zero to ¼ percent would make a lot of sense.  I don’t think we’re introducing any more ambiguity.  I think we’re introducing a bit of ambiguity especially for people who are not that well informed by saying that we don’t have a target anymore.  What President Yellen said was that it could easily be misinterpreted as “gosh, we don’t really have control over these things anymore anyway.”  I don’t think any of us believes that, and I think there’s more of a chance of that misinterpretation, which I don’t want us to have, if we do that today with all the other changes than if we waited a little.  I still think the range is a pretty big shift.  Expressing concerns about inflation being less than the level fostering economic growth—again, I think that’s something that I would prefer to wait on.  I like President Stern’s edit about talking about the appreciable diminution of inflationary pressures, but I would wait on putting in the phrase about whether the level is too low to be consistent with fostering economic growth.  I mentioned the inflation target.  I think we should wait on that.  We’re introducing conditionality, which I think is valuable to do, and I think the phrase there is fine.  We’re talking about old and new programs as well as balance sheet issues.  As a number of people have mentioned, we have already talked about standing ready to expand the purchases of agency securities as conditions warrant.  So that’s forward leaning already.  If we are committed to doing the Treasury securities fairly soon, I think we should just go along with that and feel comfortable with that.  But we do have to think a bit about the precedent of making concrete new policies that we’ve generally talked about in this statement.  Is it something that we want to do going forward.  Does this commit us to doing that.  I don’t think so, but I think we should just think about that. Then I think it’s very important that we talk about the use of the balance sheet.  I agree with Governor Warsh that to be bold you don’t say “continue to.”  But we are talking about some existing programs, so in some sense we are continuing.  I’m not quite sure exactly where we want to go on this, but I just wanted to raise that ambiguity.  On the balance sheet, though, I go back to the Chairman’s remarks from yesterday.  It is important to think about the composition of the balance sheet, not just the size in and of itself—Governor Kohn also made reference to this—so I would be very wary of focusing on the size here.  I think that just talking about ways to use the balance sheet is the appropriate way to go now.  If we have more experience and understand better how the size might evolve over time, how the different programs we have might fluctuate, I’d feel more comfortable with that.  If we talk about the size or commitment to growth of that size or expecting it to be large, just as a number of people said, it could suddenly shrink, and we don’t want people to think that we’re changing monetary policy because of that.  Some of these things would just be changing over time.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker expresses their disagreement with including certain topics in the discussion, such as the inflation target and concerns about inflation being too low. They also express their concern that discussing the balance sheet size could be misinterpreted as a change in monetary policy.


Passage number 312.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you. Governor Duke" is a polite expression of gratitude and acknowledgment.


Passage number 313.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I do favor alternative A.  In terms of what will happen with the prime rate, I frankly don’t know, but I think it will leave the banks to determine their own prime rate and floors as they wish.  I would not minimize the fact that we are actually still setting a rate for the interest on excess reserves as well as the discount rate.  This experience with interest on reserves is brand new for us, and I don’t think we’ve had enough experience to know how it is actually going to work.  It does leave room for the spread to establish itself as the fed funds market regenerates, and I think it gives us some room to have some experience with that regime.  I think this communicates the regime change better than any of the other alternatives, and at the end of the day, this is a communication document.  I would strongly echo President Pianalto’s comments that, in this new regime, we really need to stay on the same page to avoid total confusion in the marketplace.  I know that independence of thought is one of the strengths of this body, but if we could for a time set that aside at least in public and all speak from the same talking points, it would make all of our policies more effective. In terms of the specifics of the statement, I would defer to another day the language in brackets in paragraph 2 of alternative A.  The conditional language I would keep in.  About the phrase “to continue” and really all of paragraph 4, to my mind, although we are continuing some of the things that the Board has done, it has not necessarily been clear that all of these have been considered by the FOMC.  To me this takes everything we are doing and puts it in the middle of this table and gives us time to discuss which of them we like, what we might use or not use, and how we might express the degree to which we would use all of these tools.  We’ve made a lot of progress in a very short time in coming to the broad outlines of the things that we might do going forward, and in coming meetings we’ll actually contour those more and make them more specific.  I would include that as well.  As to whether or not we “use” our balance sheet or “expand” our balance sheet, I would leave it at this point as “use our balance sheet” and have further discussion on that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing her favor for alternative A and discussing various aspects of the proposal. She also mentions the need for unity and consistency in communication among the members.


Passage number 314.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Boy, you’ve left me a simple task.  Yes, a two-hander from President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 315.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to come back to a point I suggested.  Is there any sense in transposing paragraphs 3 and 4 to emphasize the new regime.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is simply suggesting that paragraphs 3 and 4 be transposed to highlight the new regime.


Passage number 316.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, let me comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their willingness to provide a comment on something, which does not indicate any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 317.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The statement "Yes, sir" suggests agreement or affirmation.


Passage number 318.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: This passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 319.
 MR. LACKER.  In light of our discussion of “use of” in this balance sheet quantitative, I was going to point out that President Plosser’s suggestion about a specific number for an upper bound on the size of our balance sheet would remedy the problem that we were discussing there.  In addition, it would greatly alleviate the deep discomfort I and perhaps others may have about our governance practices and the extent to which they’re publicly known.  I would also emphasize that there are two theories about the effect of our balance sheet and that this is written from the credit-spreads point of view, and it would be useful to encompass both.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely stating their agreement with President Plosser's suggestion and emphasizing the importance of including both theories about the effect of the balance sheet.


Passage number 320.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me just say, generally speaking, that we are making a lot of changes here.  I’d like to suggest that we move gradually.  But one suggestion I did like and would propose to see if it helps you is First Vice President Cumming’s suggestion of saying that we’ll provide support with measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet at a high level.  That makes it very explicit.  Later we can go further about quantitative guidelines and so forth, but for the moment we’re saying that the balance sheet size itself is of importance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion on making changes gradually and expressing agreement with a specific suggestion made by First Vice President Cumming.


Passage number 321.
 MR. LACKER.  Because the word “size” is a quantitative word, it does a lot better than “use of,” which is ambiguous about sterilization.  So to that extent I view First Vice President Cumming’s suggestion as very positive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It discusses the use of the word "size" as being more effective than "use of" in conveying a specific meaning. The author does not express disagreement with First Vice President Cumming's suggestion, stating it as positive.


Passage number 322.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser, does that satisfy you for today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage. The question appears to be a simple inquiry about satisfaction with the day's events.


Passage number 323.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Would you read that again, please.  I’m sorry, Mr. Chairman.  This is very difficult.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 324.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Just for today, “the focus of policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is describing the focus of policy going forward, which is to support financial markets, stimulate the economy, and maintain a high level of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet through open market operations and other measures.


Passage number 325.
” MR. PLOSSER.  I think it is the focus of the FOMC’s monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 326.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The focus of the Committee’s policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about a disagreement or contention regarding the focus of the Committee's policy. It simply states that the focus exists without indicating any differing perspectives or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 327.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Of the Committee’s policy—fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 328.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is that okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the phrase "Is that okay." It is a simple question asking for confirmation or agreement.


Passage number 329.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, much improved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement mentioned. Mr. Plosser simply states that something has improved.


Passage number 330.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  So in the spirit of trying to move gradually and not just overwhelm the market, I would like, as I say, to move halfway to where we want to be.  There was a slight majority in favor of alternative A, but I’m very concerned that, if we don’t say anything about the funds rate, there is just going to be confusion.  I am also concerned about the view that President Yellen, Governor Kroszner, and others raised if we sort of say that we’re not targeting it anymore.  It suggests that we’re indifferent to the rate or that we have no ability to raise it.  What does it mean to say that rates will be kept low for a long time, if we don’t have some view on that.  Again, I would cite the Japanese precedent.  I understand the concerns about community banks.  I do think that’s not a reason that should control our policy, and they certainly can change their pricing policy.  So let me make some suggestions.  Brian, will someone take notes.  Then we can come back.  In order to be conservative and avoid risk, I would like to propose alternative B.  In the first paragraph, I would take Governor Warsh’s suggestion and say “target range for the federal funds rate between 0 and ¼ percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their concerns and proposing alternatives, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict between different perspectives or parties.


Passage number 331.
” MR. LACKER.  I’m sorry.  Say that again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 332.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “Target range for the federal funds rate of between 0 and ¼ percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 333.
” MR. LACKER.  “Of between”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Of between" is incomplete and does not convey any clear argument or disagreement.


Passage number 334.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, sorry.  Not “of between” but “a target for the federal funds rate between 0 and ¼ percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states a correction or clarification, there is no contention or disagreement present.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 335.
” MR. LACKER.  So the target is between.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the phrase "So the target is between" which suggests that there is a difference or discrepancy in opinion regarding the target.


Passage number 336.
 MR. KOHN.  A target or a target range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement or topic of discussion without any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 337.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Target range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage provided. The phrase "Target range" does not indicate any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints. It simply suggests a predefined range or goal that is being discussed.


Passage number 338.
 MR. LACKER.  Target range is between.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the range of a target without any conflicting opinions or perspectives.


Passage number 339.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “The target range for the federal funds rate between 0 and ¼ percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply stating the target range for the federal funds rate.


Passage number 340.
” MR. LACKER.  So the target range is to be between those two numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating the target range without any argument or disagreement.


Passage number 341.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Okay.  Scratch it.  Paragraph 1 is the same.  That’s simple.  Paragraph 2 is the same, including the additional sentence about financial markets, no longer bolded.  Paragraph 3, President Stern was right about “quickly.”  Why don’t we say “appreciably”.  Now, a lot of people have talked about inflation targets.  I think we should look at that very seriously.  Today is not the day to do it.  Maybe that should be introduced simultaneously with concerns about deflation.  I propose that we strike the bracketed material but put the word “further” after “moderate”:  “The Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters.”  The fourth paragraph as is—most people were okay with the conditionality there.  In the fifth paragraph, strike “continue to”:  “The focus of the Committee’s policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level.”  You know, I get the sense from the Committee that they will entertain purchases of Treasury securities in the next quarter or so.  In order not to jerk the market around too much, I think we should therefore mention it and leave it where it is.  So the only change in paragraph 5 that I’m proposing is in the first sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting changes to the text, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict among the individuals involved.


Passage number 342.
 MR. KROSZNER.  So the last sentence will have “continue to” or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage is not provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the following passage.


Passage number 343.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Let’s see.  Yes, I think it has to be there.  “The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet.”  I think we have to say that because we have used it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their own thoughts and opinions without contradicting or disputing any previous statement or viewpoint.


Passage number 344.
 MS. DUKE.  Would that say “the Committee”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply asks about the phrasing of "the Committee."


Passage number 345.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 346.
 MS. DUKE.  Would that say the “Committee will” or “the Federal Reserve will”.  Perhaps “the Committee will continue to consider ways to use the Federal Reserve balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 347.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “The Committee will continue to consider ways of using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.”  I think we should leave it where it is.  Just leave it ambiguous for now, if that’s okay.  So those are the changes.  Brian, would you like just to read that.  Are you able to read it that.  Do you have the information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement and a request for clarification, but it does not involve disagreement or conflicting opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 348.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.


Passage number 349.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Would you go ahead and read the thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 350.
 MR. MADIGAN.  “The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent.  Since the Committee’s last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined.  Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight.  Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  In particular, the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. The focus of the Committee’s policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at a high level.  As previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasuries securities.  Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the term asset-backed securities loan facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct disagreement or contention. It mainly consists of a report on the decision and actions of the Federal Open Market Committee.


Passage number 351.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And then the related action.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is a related action following President Plosser's statement without giving any indication of controversy or disagreement.


Passage number 352.
 MR. PLOSSER.  This is a clarification, Mr. Chairman.  I hate to be difficult, but in thinking about this as a step, we talked about an inflation target.  What other steps do you see that we need to clarify as we try to make this process more—I’m looking for some forward-looking language here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser is requesting clarification and suggestions for additional steps to improve the process.


Passage number 353.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we need to talk about it.  I think there are two promising directions.  One is to have an inflation target or something close to an inflation target, depending on how the Committee decides, what we think is feasible, and so on.  The other would be to develop a more formalized structure for discussing the integrated responsibilities we have with respect to the balance sheet, and that could involve quantitative ranges, for example.  I didn’t quite like your ceiling because I think in some cases you might want to have a floor.  But I don’t think, as I said yesterday, that we can describe our policies in a single number, and I don’t think that a target for the overall size of the balance sheet is a sufficient statistic for what we’re doing.  But I do think that, for governance and other reasons, we can talk about ranges, consultation, and so on, about the size of the balance sheet.  Okay.  Again, I apologize that this is an imperfect document.  Given the many moving parts, as I said, I wanted to try to keep it from being too overwhelming.  This is going to be a big enough step as it is.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing potential directions for policy and expressing their thoughts on various options.


Passage number 354.
 MR. KOHN.  Just one further clarification.  By sustaining the balance sheet at a high level, we’re not promising that it won’t fall from here, right.  Just that it will be higher than it ordinarily would be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Both parties seem to agree that sustaining the balance sheet at a high level does not promise that it won't fall from its current state, but it will still be higher than it usually would be.


Passage number 355.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That it’s going to be above $800 billion for some time I would think is a fair statement.  Does anyone else have a comment.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a fair assumption, and Governor Warsh is simply inviting other participants to add their comments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 356.
 MR. WARSH.  I apologize for the bad English that I offered before, but an alternative to the first sentence that you read that would, I think, be English to Jeff’s fair point—it would be to delete the word “target.”  So it says, “To establish a range for the federal funds rate between zero and ¼ percent.”  So those are your two options.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The disagreement is between Mr. Warsh and someone referred to as "Jeff" regarding the wording of the first sentence. Mr. Warsh suggests an alternative wording without the word "target," while Jeff likely has a different opinion on how the sentence should be phrased.


Passage number 357.
 MR. LACKER.  But it’s the same issue.  “Range” is the noun, and you’re saying that the range lies between those things, and you’re not telling everyone what the range is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is simply seeking clarification or further information about the range being discussed.


Passage number 358.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It would be a range of 0 to ¼ percent.  I think that would be right. PARTICIPANTS.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the statement and confirms its accuracy.


Passage number 359.
 MR. WARSH.  Withdrawn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that Mr. Warsh has withdrawn.


Passage number 360.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There isn't enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 361.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I can’t support that, and I’ll tell you why.  I do feel that we had an elegant solution in alternative A.  I firmly believe that if we target 0 to 25 basis points—the effective funds rate we all know is trading at 1/16—it is going to create enormous backlash.  It is unacceptable to me to say that the bankers will figure out how to deal with this.  They can’t.  Second, as far as money market funds are concerned, the expense load is usually 30 basis points.  So for whatever it is worth, I will be a minority of one, but I cannot support that.  Alternative A was elegant in that it made no statement.  Then, and I think very important, by dwelling on this business of what our target rate is, we diminish what we’re doing, and what we’re doing is changing things fundamentally, which I fully support. So for whatever it’s worth, I understand all the counter-arguments.  Janet and I have talked about this.  I know what people are going to say.  I think (a) it is an unnecessary distraction, (b) it creates a potential political backlash, and (c) it is counterproductive.  So I just want to state it myself straightforwardly and honestly—I may be the only person at this table, but I’ll vote against that.  If you give us alternative A, I’ll vote for it.  I know I’m one of 17 at this table—there are more than 17 people at this table.  I apologize, but I don’t think it’s necessary to make the funds rate clear.  It’s implied in what we’re doing, but alternative A gives people enough ambiguity to steer around it, and that’s my opinion.  I apologize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, expresses disagreement with an unspecified proposal. He argues that alternative A is a better solution and states his reasons for opposing the proposal.


Passage number 362.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think confusion is an extraordinarily dangerous thing for us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This sentence expresses the speaker's personal opinion about confusion being dangerous. There is no explicit mention of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 363.
 MR. FISHER.  The key is paragraph 4 in alternative A—that is what we’re doing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is referencing paragraph 4 of alternative A as the key point for their current actions. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement.


Passage number 364.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I agree with that.  What B says is that this is the end of one regime and the beginning of another.  The first one says that this is the end, and then we say what are we doing going forward.  I think that clarity is needed.  If we did what you’re suggesting, I don’t know for sure what would happen, but I think there would be a lot of commentary and questions:  “What are they saying.  What do they mean.”  That would be much more than what B does.  I understand your point.  I thought hard about it, and I know that there was a mixture of views.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the idea that clarity is needed in the situation and is discussing potential consequences of following a different approach.


Passage number 365.
 MS. DUKE.  I’d like to ask one question just, again, about going forward.  We talked about what you would do differently tomorrow under alternatives A and B and determined that it was nothing.  What would you do going forward if federal funds started to trade above 25 basis points under alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
In this passage, there does not appear to be any contention or disagreement. MS. Duke is simply asking a question about future actions related to alternative B.


Passage number 366.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I guess we would stop doing reverse repos to signal our protesting of the fact that the fed funds rate is trading soft to its targets.  That’s the first thing we’d do.  I have to say that I think the probability of this happening is extremely remote because banks are balance sheet constrained and therefore aren’t going to do that perfect arbitrage.  Maybe in a normal world it would be possible to get fed funds to trade above the interest on excess reserves, but in this world it’s just extraordinarily unlikely.  But if it were to happen, we would signal our unhappiness with that, and the first thing we would do is we’d stop doing the reverses that we’ve been doing every day to protest the softness in the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their perspective and explaining what actions they would take in a hypothetical situation.


Passage number 367.
 MS. DUKE.  But you would be able to pull it back down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any form of contention or disagreement. It simply introduces a statement by Ms. Duke without any conflicting or opposing views.


Passage number 368.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t know how quickly we could pull it back down.  Look.  I don’t think that this is going to happen under almost any conceivable circumstance, but if it were to happen, we would basically add reserves to protest what we’re seeing.  Time would pass.  We’d have another FOMC meeting, and we would make an adjustment to the framework.  But I think this is an extremely remote possibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 369.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  First Vice President Cumming.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 370.
 MS. CUMMING.  I think that, if we see the risk of institutional factors, like the way the prime rate is linked to rates, really getting in the way of good policy, we have an obligation to work with the banking community, work with other regulators if necessary, and work with the SEC if necessary to clear those institutional obstacles.  So I wouldn’t let the institutional things be something that gets in our way, rather they would be something that we can really help overcome where we see problems.  That link could be changed, and we may want to work actively with the banking community to make sure that it happens.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker suggests working together with the banking community, other regulators, and the SEC to address and overcome any institutional obstacles.


Passage number 371.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, clearly the banks are not required to move their prime rate with anything in particular.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not express any form of contention or disagreement. It simply presents a clear assertion about banks not being required to adjust their prime rate in response to any specific factor.


Passage number 372.
 MR. FISHER.  Of course.  They can always have their markup, but you can also reverse the argument and say, so why do you want to cut rates.  Again, I think we’re pushing on a string here, Mr. Chairman.  Forgive me for speaking, but the guts of what we’re doing and the importance of what we’re doing, which I fully support, are in paragraph 4, and I believe we’re distracting from that by focusing on the fed funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is expressing his agreement with the importance of what they are doing, but also suggesting that focusing on the fed funds rate may be distracting from that.


Passage number 373.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I agree with what you’re saying about the important part, but it is nevertheless the case that—as President Yellen pointed out—if we wanted to, we could raise the funds rate if we put on enough pressure.  Therefore, in an important sense a decision is being made here to end this particular policy approach and to move clearly to another one with the words “the focus of the Committee’s policies going forward will be” and that is described in a lengthy paragraph.  I am just so concerned about what will happen if we say we’re not going to target it.  What does that mean.  Is it going to be 5 percent tomorrow.  I just fear the confusion.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the previous point made by President Yellen and expressing their concern about the potential consequences of ending a particular policy approach.


Passage number 374.
 MR. HOENIG.  In terms of what we’re going to be speaking about regarding the new regime, I think it was easier when we had alternative A and we were going to a new regime than when we’re saying, “Well, okay, we’re going to end this regime here.”  I’m giving this speech; I get questions.  We’re going to end this regime, and we’re going to go to this.  So now I’m in the middle of a transition, and I’m trying to explain it, but other than, “Yes, we left this behind, and here we are going forward.”  So that’s my concern about the middle step here.  I guess in your opinion it’s easier to explain going from “Here’s the old regime; we’re going to stick to it for a little while longer and then . . .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely expressing the speaker's concern about explaining a transition from one regime to another.


Passage number 375.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.  Today is the end of the old regime.  We have hit zero.  We can’t go further.  Going forward, this is what we’re going to do.  I think that’s clearer.  Again, I’m just concerned about not saying what we’re doing with the funds rate.  Are we going to let it do whatever it wants to do from today.  I think that’s just going to create volatility.  Again, I’m sorry for those who are in disagreement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit disagreements or contention.


Passage number 376.
 MR. DUDLEY.  For what it’s worth, Mr. Chairman, I agree with you.  I think the market will be more confused about alternative A than alternative B.  If that’s important, then that should be part of the decision.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Dudley is expressing agreement with the chairman and stating his opinion about the market being more confused about alternative A than alternative B. He also suggests considering the importance of this factor in the decision.


Passage number 377.
 MR. FISHER.  But I asked you that during the question period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement about asking a question during a specific period.


Passage number 378.
   MR. DUDLEY.  I said substantively we’re not going to conduct policy any differently, but the market will be more confused about A than about B in terms of having to process what this means.  Now, it will get to the right answer eventually, but it will be more confused in terms of processing information, in my opinion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Dudley expresses his opinion that the market will be more confused about A than about B in terms of processing information, but he also acknowledges that it will eventually reach the right answer.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 379.
 MR. KROSZNER.  I just want to underscore that, because that was my concern in moving toward B rather than A because I certainly agree that the economic substance is the same.  But I do think there’s much more of an opportunity for misinterpretation by the market, and for us to say that we don’t have control of the fed funds rate is the main concern that I have with A.  I think B is very clear.  The idea of talking about a range, including zero, is something that at least as far as I know the Fed has never done before, and I think that’s an enormous shift.  That will be seen as a real shift.  But to go to A would have ambiguity and would be very difficult to explain to people who are not real aficionados that we’re not saying, “Gosh, we really don’t have the opportunity to fix the federal funds rate anymore.  That piece is broken.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses disagreement and raises concerns about option A. They believe that option B is clearer and avoids misinterpretation by the market.


Passage number 380.
” MR. FISHER.  I heard eleven people argue the case for alternative A.  I counted them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states that Mr. Fisher heard eleven people argue for alternative A. Counting them does not imply any disagreement or contention among those people.


Passage number 381.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Most of them said it was pretty close, and it’s a matter of communication.  It’s my judgment that we are just going to cause a lot of criticism and a lot of concern and confusion if we do it now.  I also agree that it’s fairly close.  But my feeling is that the concern of clarity is more important to me.  Others.  Would you call the roll, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges that most people see the issue as close and a matter of communication. The speaker then expresses their own judgment and feeling about the situation but does not present it in opposition to the views of others.


Passage number 382.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement by Mr. Madigan is given without any opposing views or conflicting information.


Passage number 383.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without seeing the passage, it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement. Please provide the passage.


Passage number 384.
 MR. MADIGAN.  There is also the issue of the directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: The given passage does not present any statements or claims that indicate contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the existence of an issue or topic without taking a stance or presenting conflicting views.


Passage number 385.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The directive would stand as we’ve written it, with the additional sentence at the end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a decision and a further addition to be made.


Passage number 386.
 MS. DANKER.  Yes, that’s right.  The vote will encompass the statement as Brian Madigan read it and the draft directive for alternative B as was shown in the handout.  Since it is longer this time and we are short of time, I won’t read it. Chairman Bernanke   Yes First Vice President Cumming  Yes Governor Duke   Yes President Fisher   No Governor Kohn   Yes Governor Kroszner   Yes President Pianalto   Yes President Plosser   With some reluctance, I will vote yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. All individuals mentioned are in agreement and vote yes.


Passage number 387.
 President SternYes Governor Warsh   Yes  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Could we bring lunch back.  Would that work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The response from President Stern and Governor Warsh does not indicate any disagreement, but rather a confirmation or agreement with the idea of bringing lunch back. The use of "Yes" and "Thank you" suggests a positive response without any conflicting views.


Passage number 388.
 MS. DANKER.  That doesn’t usually work well in a recorded session.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about recorded sessions without any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 389.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That doesn’t work well.  All right.  Let’s have half an hour for lunch.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contentious statement. It consists of a statement about something not working well and a suggestion for a lunch break. There is no indication of conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 390.
 MR. MADIGAN.  The Board meeting, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there was a Board meeting without any indication of conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 391.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The Board meeting is adjourned.  Hold on.  The Board will go into my office.  Everyone else, lunch.  We will take a half hour break, and then we have just a few short items afterwards to complete.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply consists of informational statements and instructions.


Passage number 392.
 [Lunch break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s reconvene briefly for a couple of other items.  On consideration, in order to maintain a united front with the Committee, President Fisher changed his vote to vote “yes” on the resolution.  We have two items.  First, Governor Kohn is going to talk a bit about our longer-term projection, and then we would like just to hear a bit from Bill Dudley and Pat Parkinson about the TALF.  We have had several previous briefings on this, but we will update this and talk a bit about its implications for balance sheet management.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. It simply outlines the agenda for a meeting and mentions a change in vote by President Fisher.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 393.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You should have gotten memos from the Subcommittee on Communications having to do with the longer-term projections.  In considering the trial run and also the current situation, in which the ’09, ’10, and ’11 projections really weren’t settling down and didn’t look as though they would soon settle down into what would be consistent with where we would want things to be in the long term.  In these circumstances, the subcommittee thought it would be a good idea to go ahead with a quarterly extension of the projections to give the public a better idea of where we thought output, growth, employment, and inflation were expected to be over the longer run. We made four recommendations within that overall recommendation.  We recommended that we do it quarterly, not just once a year, and that the discussion be integrated with the rest of the quarterly projection process in the Summary of Economic Projections.  We also recommended that we continue to do this for total PCE inflation but, as we did in the trial run, not do it for core PCE to emphasize to the public that it was the total we were looking at over the long run and not the core.  We thought that the questionnaire should ask each participant to provide “your best assessment of the rate to which each variable would converge over the longer term (say, five to six years from now) in the absence of shocks and assuming appropriate monetary policy.”  This would be something that didn’t emphasize the fact that it was five or six years but where things would settle down and it might take five or six years to settle down.  So those are our recommendations.  Did I missing anything—I’m looking at the subcommittee members. After today’s and yesterday’s discussions, I think the subcommittee will also take another look at whether the Committee should move further in the direction of an inflation target and get some material to the Committee before the January meeting.  I think we are not looking for a vote on this today, but if anybody has any views about whether this is the appropriate direction in which to go, I would like to hear them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions that the subcommittee made recommendations for quarterly extensions of projections and integrating the discussion with the Summary of Economic Projections. It also mentions the subcommittee's consideration of moving further in the direction of an inflation target. These suggestions and considerations could lead to contention or disagreement among the committee members.


Passage number 394.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 395.
 MR. LACKER.  I think the subcommittee ought to consider whether, if the Committee adopts a 2 percent or whatever inflation objective, it might be more confusing than clarifying for us to also be issuing these long-range convergence projections.  My first cut at thinking this through—I haven’t given this a lot of thought—is that, if we are going to say our target is X, I don’t see why we would even need these.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Lacker is expressing his personal opinion about whether or not the subcommittee should consider issuing long-range convergence projections if the Committee adopts a specific inflation objective. He suggests that it might be more confusing than clarifying to have both. However, there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement as he is just presenting his initial thoughts and has not given the topic much consideration yet.


Passage number 396.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This is why they need to look at it now because I think they really are substitutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the belief that the subject needs to be examined presently.


Passage number 397.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I think they are substitutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion that two things are substitutes for each other.


Passage number 398.
  MR. KOHN.  You might still need the output and unemployment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting ideas or arguments.


Passage number 399.
 MR. LACKER.  What for.  We don’t control—well, you know that—sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification or information.


Passage number 400.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other comments or questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply an invitation for additional comments or questions.


Passage number 401.
   MR. PLOSSER.  I guess, given the zero lower bound issues that we have been discussing and some of the consequences of being there, the difficulty of dealing with policy in that environment, in previous meetings on this topic we have talked about the prospects of specifying the funds rate path or the range of the funds rate paths of Committee members and their projections.  It was suggested earlier that, had we done that previously, we might be in a position to signal to the markets more about our commitment to inflation or something like that.  So I guess what I’m saying, in the context of both inflation targeting and its projections, giving that a second round of thought, in terms of how it might fit in with that, would be useful under some circumstances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 402.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Anyone else.  All right.  Let me turn to Bill, who very kindly learned that he was on the program about fifteen hours ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrases used are more of acknowledgments and transitions to different speakers, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 403.
  MR. PARKINSON.  No, I don’t think so.  Again, I think the message, as Bill is saying, from the investors and the issuers was that a three-year term would greatly enhance the chances of success.  Indeed, I think our friends in the Treasury Department, at least in the case of government-guaranteed loans, would like to go even longer than that.  But both the Board staff and the New York staff thought that it would work best at three years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with Bill's statement and mentioning that both the Board staff and the New York staff share the same view.


Passage number 404.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Three years gets you far enough along that reasonable people will believe that three years from now you might actually be able to get private-sector financing for this stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is making a prediction or expressing a belief that three years is a sufficient time period to attract private-sector financing for a particular matter. There is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting opinion presented.


Passage number 405.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I am going to need to consult on an informal basis with the other Board members on this.  But in the spirit of our discussion yesterday, I invite questions or comments, which will inform our thinking on this as well.  Does anyone have any questions or thoughts on this.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any disagreement or contention. It is simply an invitation for discussion and input from the other Board members.


Passage number 406.
 MR. LACKER.  You said that investors who bought this and put this and got the lending would have the haircut at risk, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a direct question asking for confirmation or clarification of a statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 407.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions Mr. Dudley but does not provide any context or information about what the contention or disagreement is.


Passage number 408.
 MR. LACKER.  They would get all of the upside.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The statement by Mr. Lacker is presented as a straightforward statement without any conflicting ideas or opposing opinions.


Passage number 409.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context that suggests any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 410.
 MR. LACKER.  So if spreads close in the marketplace, then they get the upside—so we are essentially lending to them to make a leveraged bet on the securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 411.
  MR. DUDLEY.  The purpose of this facility is not to give investors profits.  The purpose of this facility is to address the fact that lending spreads on AAA-rated securities are extremely wide right now and the securitization market is closed.  The idea is that, if you offer more-attractive terms than those available in the market, the demand for these securities will increase, issuers will be able to sell these securities at better prices and lower spreads, and the consequences of that will be lower lending rates and improved credit availability to households.  The goal at the end of the day is not to do anything for investors.  The goal is to harness investors’ profit motivation to drive down spreads in the AAA market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Dudley, is explaining the purpose of the facility and the goal they aim to achieve. There is no mention of opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 412.
 MR. LACKER.  I understand.  Now, why are spreads high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage is a question posed by Mr. Lacker, seeking an explanation for high spreads. There is no contention or disagreement stated.


Passage number 413.
  MR. DUDLEY.  Our view is that spreads are high mainly because people can’t get leverage—that is number 1.  Number 2, the traditional buyers of these AAA-rated assets either have disappeared completely, like SIVs and bank conduits, or have balance sheet constraints.  So the risk capital hasn’t really been willing to come in because they can’t get the financing to make it worth their while.  You know, LIBOR plus 300 is not an attractive proposition for someone who is using capital on an unleveraged basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the view of Mr. Dudley regarding the reasons for high spreads.


Passage number 414.
 MR. LACKER.  When I think about leverage and the demand for a given security, if I, as an investor, am going to make a leveraged purchase, then whoever is giving me a loan to make that is also taking a risk position in the security.  So the demand that leveraged investors make is really a joint demand by them and the lenders.  Everything you have said sounds as if demand is low.  Am I missing something here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and expressing a possible misunderstanding about the concept of demand and leverage.


Passage number 415.
 MR. DUDLEY.  The demand is low for these securities today.  It is low because of lack of leverage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of fact about the current demand for securities.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 416.
   MR. LACKER.  In other words, I’m saying that people who would provide funding also have a low demand or a low evaluation of the value of those securities.  This all amounts to a bunch of people out there putting a low value on these securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker states that there are "people out there putting a low value on these securities," suggesting that there is disagreement or contention among the individuals involved in evaluating the value of the securities.


Passage number 417.
 MR. DUDLEY.  No, I don’t think that is quite right.  We are in basically a market disequilibrium, where the traditional buyers of these securities have vanished.  In a normal market environment, it would be completely reasonable to lend against these securities on a leveraged basis.  But the people who would do that lending—banks and dealers—are balance sheet constrained, and that is why they are not willing to make those loans.  If we had a normal banking and dealer situation today in which they were willing to extend loans to their counterparties, they would be providing the leverage.  But that is just not happening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 418.
 MR. LACKER.  Do you mean they are not making purchases.  They still exist—right.—you said buyers vanished.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification on the concept of buyers vanishing and whether they still exist.


Passage number 419.
 MR. PARKINSON.  The lenders, I think he was saying.  Some of the buyers vanished in the sense that they were SIVs or a lot of them were actually securities lenders who were reinvesting their cash collateral in this, and they have learned a lesson about doing that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact about some buyers who vanished and the lesson they learned.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 420.
 MR. LACKER.  What evidence do you have that their absence from the market doesn’t reflect just adverse views about the value of the securities that we should treat the way we treat all other security evaluation decisions that market participants make.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker is asking for evidence to support a different view or explanation for the absence from the market, suggesting a potential disagreement or alternate argument.


Passage number 421.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I think the counterfactual is what the investors tell us.  They tell us that that is not the case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a belief and mentioning what the investors have told them.


Passage number 422.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, wait.  These are the ones who would be aided by this program, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a question and does not express any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 423.
 MR. DUDLEY.  If you look at AAA-rated assets, the historical credit risk on these assets is very, very low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is presented as a fact without any opposing viewpoints or disagreement.


Passage number 424.
  MR. LACKER.  Over the cycle or in a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing a potential timeframe, either over the cycle or in a recession.


Passage number 425.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Yesterday we talked about AAA tranches of student loans, which are 97 percent backed by the Department of Education.  They are selling at LIBOR plus 300 or LIBOR plus 400.  It is hard to say that those securities are priced there because of credit risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states information about AAA tranches of student loans and their pricing.


Passage number 426.
 MR. LACKER.  What would a security like that have sold for in 1974 or 1981.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents a question without any conflicting points of view or opposing statements.


Passage number 427.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I would be very surprised if you saw anything similar to what we are seeing today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Dudley is expressing his surprise at the possibility of seeing something similar to what is being witnessed at the present moment.


Passage number 428.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, they didn’t exist them, so we can’t look it up, for one.  So how do we know these are out of bounds with what they would have traded at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing uncertainty about the existence of certain information and questioning how it can be determined.


Passage number 429.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Jeff, this is all a judgment call.  We have been making lots of judgment calls.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating that they have been making judgment calls, indicating a subjective decision-making process, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention between the speakers.


Passage number 430.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I know.  But you are not giving us any evidence about this, Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker simply states that the person he's addressing has not provided any evidence regarding a certain matter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 431.
  You are not bringing anything coherent that is— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There is an ongoing discussion about whether prices in markets are in some sense Pareto optimal prices or whether there is liquidity risk, other premiums, that the central bank could do something about.  I don’t know any way to resolve it.  We have the same discussion each time.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The passage mentions an ongoing discussion or debate regarding whether prices in markets are Pareto optimal or if there are other factors, such as liquidity risk and other premiums, that the central bank could intervene in. The speaker states that they don't know how to resolve this disagreement, suggesting that there is contention or disagreement within the discussion.


Passage number 432.
 MR. HOENIG.  All right.  So we are going to give them a three-year term to give them assurances that they don’t have to worry about rolling over.  I am assuming that, as the market improves—and it should over the next year or 18 months—this would be almost self-liquidating because it would then become attractive to these parties to leave now and that would be taking it off our balance sheet.  Is that the operating assumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their assumption about the market improving and how it would potentially lead to the parties leaving, which would benefit their balance sheet.


Passage number 433.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, it really depends on what rate we are charging for the loan.  Presumably we are going to charge for the loan at a rate that is attractive in times of extremis and somewhat expensive in normal times.  So the question really is, Will the market financing improve quickly enough to make the market a cheaper source of funds.  I don’t think we can count on all of these loans going away before the end of the term.  I think we have to presume that the term could actually be three years because we just don’t know whether the financing will be available from the private sector sooner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing a hypothetical situation and expressing uncertainty about the outcome. There is no mention or indication of any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 434.
 MR. HOENIG.  That puts us at risk of taking a loss, then, if we should decide to reverse the policy action.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or dispute. It simply states a potential risk involved in reversing a policy action.


Passage number 435.
 MR. PARKINSON.  But we could accelerate that process by raising the minimum rate at which we would lend and so make it a higher spread above LIBOR.  If we are going to do it through an auction—there are still some questions about how to allocate the credit within this program—and if there is a minimum rate at which we would make funds available in the auction (that would be the spread over LIBOR) and we adjust that spread upward, we’re giving them more of a push to go back to relying on market financing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Parkinson explaining a potential strategy to accelerate a process.


Passage number 436.
 MR. HOENIG.  That would be the ideal—to push them back out as quickly as possible when the market straightens out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker is expressing an ideal scenario which does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 437.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I think the idea would be that the window for this program would not be three years.  It would be a shorter period of time.  So the program would come to an end by the end of 2009 perhaps, but the loans that we had made during that period could be outstanding for some time beyond that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Dudley is simply explaining his perspective on the duration of the program and the potential timeline for repayment of the loans.


Passage number 438.
 MR. HOENIG.  But we’re talking about a lot of assets on our books.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is merely stating a fact.


Passage number 439.
 MR. DUDLEY.  The other thing that we should talk a bit about is credit risk to the Fed in all of this.  I think the important thing to recognize here is that the credit risk to the Fed is quite low because the Federal Reserve is protected by two things.  One, it is protected by the haircuts.  The Fed’s risk is a credit risk not a mark-to-market risk.  Two, the Fed is also protected by the TARP money.  The way this will work is that, to the extent that people put securities to us, we take those securities and we place them in a disposition SPV (special purpose vehicle) that’s capitalized by TARP money.  We’ve been doing a lot of work recently about how risky these assets are and what the risk of loss is to the Fed.  It turns out that it’s very hard to generate scenarios in which the Fed has any meaningful risk of loss.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the low credit risk to the Federal Reserve and clarifying the protections in place.


Passage number 440.
 MR. HOENIG.  I have no problem with that.  What I’m thinking about is, if we do define a new regime, how we conduct policy.  How are we tying ourselves down now relative to what we might want to do in the future in moving these assets on and off our balance sheet.  I think that the more flexibility we have in moving them out, the more flexibility we have in any new regime we put forward, and to me that’s important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Hoenig, is expressing agreement and discussing his own thoughts and concerns about defining a new regime. He is discussing the need for flexibility in moving assets on and off the balance sheet, which he believes is important. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 441.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kohn, did you have a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply asking Governor Kohn if they have a comment on something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 442.
 MR. KOHN.  A comment and a question.  One comment, to follow up on your comment, Mr. Chairman, to President Lacker—I think there’s pretty good evidence that there are liquidity strains in the market, beyond just credit strains, impinging on the price of these securities.  One piece of evidence I would cite is the difference between on-the-run and the off-the-run Treasury security rates, which have gapped out by 40 or 50 basis points even from—well, I’m not even sure where they are relative to ’98, but I think they’re at record levels.  The unwillingness of people—by “people” I mean market makers—to take positions and to do trades—their caution—is affecting the pricing of all kinds of securities well beyond the credit risk, and obviously there’s no difference in the credit risk in on-the-run and off-the-run Treasury securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kohn, is suggesting that there are liquidity strains in the market that are affecting the pricing of securities, beyond just credit risks. He cites the difference between on-the-run and off-the-run Treasury security rates as evidence of this. However, he does not provide any data or specific examples to support his claim. It is unclear whether other participants in the discussion agree with Mr. Kohn's assessment or not.


Passage number 443.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Cash bonds versus derivatives, for example.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply mentioning two different financial instruments (cash bonds and derivatives) as examples, without expressing any conflict or disagreement between the two.


Passage number 444.
 MR. KOHN.  Right.  The point that Bill made yesterday was that the equivalent things are selling at very different rates and no one is doing the arbitrage.  Second, I like the model that Bill just described in which the Federal Reserve supplies liquidity but the private sector plus the Treasury takes the credit risk.  I think that puts us in the right place and puts the taxpayer in the right place.  So I think it’s a good idea to get this thing working and look for other opportunities to use it with the agreement of the Treasury.  We can’t do it by ourselves. My questions are that I thought we had some feedback along two lines I’d like to hear your comment on.  One is that AAA wasn’t enough, that when we started this we thought doing just AAA tranches would restart the markets.  So comment on that.  The other question is about the nonleveraged purchasers of this paper.  We’re not really catering to them, and will it be successful soon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kohn, is expressing agreement and support for the ideas and models presented by Bill. There are some questions raised, but they do not indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 445.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Okay.  On the AAA—it is really for specific classes.  I think we’ve heard that somehow the AAA would not be sufficient mostly from the auto loan area.  It’s hard to judge how credible that is, given that the AAA is the big bulk of the capital structure.  So if you’re getting good financing for most of the capital structure, it’s hard to believe that you can’t pay people at the bottom of the capital structure a high enough rate to induce them to do that.  So I think I’m a little skeptical that this is true.  I think that this program will be successful even if we confine it to just AAA.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Dudley, is expressing his skepticism about the claim that the AAA would not be sufficient in the auto loan area, but he does not directly disagree with anyone or engage in a debate.


Passage number 446.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Even of those who are saying that today they’re having trouble not only placing the AAA but also placing the other tranches, a number say that, if you could start pricing the AAA tranche, that would make placing the others a lot easier.  Basically you’d be determining how much of the spread income from the underlying assets has to go to the AAA, and that tells you how much you have left to compensate the lower rated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating the views of others regarding the placement of different tranches, and some suggest that pricing the AAA tranche first would make placing the other tranches easier. This does not indicate any disagreement or contention among the parties involved.


Passage number 447.
 MR. DUDLEY.  You can figure out the economics better once you know how much you have to pay for that 75 percent of the capital structure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement by Mr. Dudley is a straightforward statement about figuring out the economics once the cost of 75 percent of the capital structure is known.


Passage number 448.
 MR. KOHN.  On the nonleveraged.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is describing a statement or position made by Mr. Kohn without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting information.


Passage number 449.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t think this program addresses the nonleveraged, but I think there’s not much nonleveraged interest in this sector at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The speaker is simply stating their opinion and observations about the lack of nonleveraged interest in a certain sector. There is no indication of contention or disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 450.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Well, that’s the fundamental problem.  Again, some of them were these classes of investors, who are no longer around.  Even if they were around, I don’t think we’d want them around—the SIV and securities lenders et cetera.  But then you have the pension funds, the insurance companies, and so forth that are not in the market, and this really doesn’t do anything at least initially to bring them back to the market.  We have scratched our heads at some length trying to figure out a program that the Federal Reserve could develop that would entice them into the market.  But I think the fundamental problem is that our tool is the ability to lend, and if we’re lending, there has to be a borrower.  If you’re talking about pension funds or life insurance companies that are not leveraged investors, it’s just not clear how we can do much to help them get enthusiastic again about buying these securities.  In the longer run, the agenda of providing liquidity to markets has to be joined with the reform agenda and figuring out what we can do to bring back confidence in structured credit products by those types of investors.  There are lots of recommendations out there—from the President’s Working Group and the Financial Stability Forum—and SIFMA came out with a long study about restoring confidence in the securitization markets.  All of that, unfortunately, is going to take a while to implement, and as with so many other things these days, we’re in uncharted territory.  Nobody knows for sure, I think, whether any of those things, even though they make sense, will really be sufficient to bring those investors back.  But as much as we try to come up with programs to address that, it seems at the moment to be beyond our power.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and acknowledging the challenges in bringing certain types of investors back into the market.


Passage number 451.
 MR. DUDLEY.  May I add just one thing to that.  It’s also not clear to me that the private sector won’t be clever enough to take these things and package them into securities that have the equity and the leverage embedded in them and sell them to people who want to get high rates of return.  It might be a pretty interesting proposition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and questioning whether the private sector will find ways to package and sell these securities to individuals seeking high returns.


Passage number 452.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage provided is incomplete, and it is not clear if there is any contention or disagreement in the missing parts. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question without additional context.


Passage number 453.
 MR. LACKER.  So are there any other constraints of a legal or regulatory nature on participants in this market.  Is there anything that keeps any hedge fund in the world from buying these things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a simple question asking about legal or regulatory constraints on participants in a market.


Passage number 454.
 MR. DUDLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without any context or specific passage provided, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the statement "MR. DUDLEY."


Passage number 455.
  Yes, we’re still working on— MR. LACKER.  No, no, no, not the program—the underlying securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. In fact, the speaker interrupts to clarify that they are not talking about the program itself but rather the underlying securities.


Passage number 456.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  In general.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opinions. It simply provides a general statement without any indication of disagreement.


Passage number 457.
 MR. LACKER.  In general.  Anyone could buy them, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The statement "Anyone could buy them, right" is a neutral question without opposing views.


Passage number 458.
 MR. DUDLEY.  The issuers have to basically conform with the TARP executive comp restrictions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement evident in this passage. It simply states that issuers have to comply with the TARP executive compensation restrictions.


Passage number 459.
 MR. LACKER.  No, no, no.  Even not participating in the program.  There are no limitations on the investors who can participate, for example, in the market for asset-backed student loans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact without any opposing views or conflicting statements.


Passage number 460.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, there is in this program, in that we’re trying to figure out the right way of restricting it to U.S. investors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Dudley, is simply stating that there is a problem or challenge in the program being discussed, as they are trying to find the correct method of limiting it to U.S. investors.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 461.
 MR. LACKER.  Excuse me.  The program doesn’t exist yet.  Right now, today, is there anything that restricts a hedge fund in London from buying an asset-backed security.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.
Explanation: The statement from Mr. Lacker suggests that there may be contention or disagreement as to whether there are restrictions on a hedge fund in London from buying an asset-backed security.


Passage number 462.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t think so—not that I’m aware of.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Dudley is simply stating that he is not aware of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 463.
 MR. PARKINSON.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 464.
 MR. LACKER.  The reason I ask—the point that I’m making—is that you can reference theories but, at the end of the day, it’s not just those predictions.  It’s the whole range of things about the theory.  We haven’t, in this, seen many theories put on the table, and the ones that have been—things like cash-in-the-market pricing—just don’t seem to match up well with the facts.  There’s a gigantic, billions of dollars worth of investors out there who have the capability of buying any of this stuff.  In Treasuries, people are capable of arbitraging that on-the-run and off-the-run thing.  To explain this by appealing to some market segmentation seems really weak in this environment.  You know, I welcome discussing theories under which these are Pareto improving programs, but I haven’t seen one that’s convincing yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Lacker is expressing his disagreement with the theories that have been put forward in the discussion. He states that the theories like cash-in-the-market pricing do not match up well with the facts and that explaining certain phenomena with market segmentation seems weak. He further mentions that he has not seen a convincing theory yet. This indicates the presence of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 465.
 MR. PARKINSON.  I think it comes back to the point that Bill made earlier.  If you’re a hedge fund, even LIBOR plus 500 is still not a rich enough return to that hedge fund unless you can borrow against those securities and leverage it up into a higher return.  And until 18 months ago you could have gotten the financing from Deutsche Bank, the Swiss banks, or any of our fine U.S. banks; but it doesn’t appear at the moment that any of them are terribly interested in lending on a secured basis even to the strongest of hedge funds.  They’re simply hiding somewhere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely stating factual information about the lack of interest from banks in lending to hedge funds on a secured basis.


Passage number 466.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think we’re in disequilibrium.  We’re in a disequilibrium in which the dealers and banks that used to do this lending are in the process of dramatically shrinking their balance sheets.  Goldman announced their fourth quarter today.  They shrank their balance sheet by 18 percent from the end of their third quarter to the end of their fourth quarter.  That’s certainly not any notion of equilibrium in the marketplace, and I think that is what’s causing the stresses in the securities markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the current state of the marketplace and the stresses in the securities markets.


Passage number 467.
 MR. LACKER.  Are we preventing equilibration.  I mean, what are we doing.  We’re in the middle of an adjustment process, it takes some time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply raises a question and acknowledges that there is an ongoing adjustment process that takes time.


Passage number 468.
 MR. DUDLEY.  The way I look at it, President Lacker, is that the deleveraging process is happening at a very rapid rate, and that speed can cause quite a bit of damage to financial conditions and, therefore, to the real economy.  To the extent that we intervene and slow down the pace of that deleveraging, we can probably mitigate the degree of damage to financial conditions and to the real economy.  That’s how I think about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Dudley is simply expressing his perspective on the deleveraging process and the potential impact on financial conditions and the real economy.


Passage number 469.
 MR. LACKER.  I look forward to seeing the model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker simply states that he looks forward to seeing the model.


Passage number 470.
 MR. FISHER.  We’re bridging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage provided.


Passage number 471.
 MR. DUDLEY.  We’re bridging—exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Dudley simply states a fact without any opposition or contradiction.


Passage number 472.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, I guess there are at least a couple of theories you could have.  One of them has to do with capital.  If you think that certain types of intermediaries have specialized knowledge and their ability to lend depends on their capital, then there are informational asymmetries in which clearly exogenous destruction of part of that capital is going to affect equilibrium outcomes in the market.  That’s one possibility.  The other class of models has to do with liquidity, where you have thick or thin markets depending on “I trade if you trade” and so on and you have markets in which nobody is trading and so no one wants to be the first to enter.  By becoming a marketmaker, you can perhaps generate more activity.   I think there are some interesting perspectives out there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement presenting two possible theories without taking a specific stance on either of them.


Passage number 473.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m familiar with those models.  We don’t have time to discuss them now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 474.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, we should discuss them off line.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a suggestion to discuss something privately or outside of the current conversation. President Rosengren's response is not provided, so it cannot be determined if there is any contention in that part of the conversation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 475.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  The loss of the securitization market is really important, so I think this facility is a very important innovation.  My question is, How important were the conduits to this market, and how confident are we that there will be structures to bring back the securitization market.  Or are we basically bridging to these things going on bank balance sheets or other types of financial intermediaries.  How do you see this.  I guess the question is, From your perspective, what is this a bridge to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker (Mr. Rosengren) believes that the facility is an important innovation and is confident that there will be structures to bring back the securitization market. However, there is no clear indication of how the other person (not explicitly mentioned) sees this or what their perspective is, hence creating a disagreement or lack of agreement.


Passage number 476.
 MR. PARKINSON.  I think the conduits were more important in some asset classes than others.  In credit cards, for example, the conduits were pretty important.  But even there they were important in recent years.  I think they were important in recent years because spreads kept on coming down and down and deterred the real money investors that traditionally invested in these products—they were no longer interested.  Yet the underwriters were able to keep the game going at those low spreads by resorting to selling to conduits and securities lenders and those sorts of things.  So over time, if we could deal with some of the issues around confidence and ratings and the other things that may be deterring the real money investors from entering the market, there is a hope of bringing them back and going back not to 2007, when it was conduits and that kind of stuff, but to, say, 2002, when you had real money investors buying these securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement analyzing the importance of conduits in different asset classes and discussing the factors that have influenced the involvement of real money investors in the market.


Passage number 477.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Also how you go through the cycle and what the loss experiences on these securities are going to be are hugely important.  If this is the worst recession in 30 years, that’s going to be a very interesting data point in terms of what the credit losses on the securities are.  If it turns out that the credit losses are low and the securities are robust, I think that will create more demand for these securities over time.  You have to weigh that, of course, in terms of what leverage we are going to require financial institutions to carry and how leveraged they can be, and where we set those two standards will determine what goes through the capital markets versus what goes through depository institutions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 478.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 479.
 MR. HOENIG.  Do we have in mind a limit as to how broadly we would make the credit facility available.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is a simple question about establishing a limit for making the credit facility available.


Passage number 480.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Currently we have the class of securities.  We’re looking at consumer and small-business ABS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states that there is a class of securities being looked at, specifically consumer and small-business ABS.


Passage number 481.
 MR. DUDLEY.  The Treasury has basically committed $20 billion of TARP, and we think that’s going to fund a program of roughly $200 billion of credit cards and auto loans and so on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the Treasury's commitment of $20 billion from TARP to fund a program of roughly $200 billion of credit cards and auto loans. There is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting statement presented.


Passage number 482.
 MR. HOENIG.  I ask that question because there are some very important industrial companies that have been financing at fairly attractive rates and are now going to have to refinance that at far less attractive rates.  I think that will have every bit as significant an impact on the economy as the mortgage-backed securities.  So unless we think through how we limit this, I think there’s a legitimate case for just about anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion that the impact of refinancing rates on industrial companies will be as significant as the impact of mortgage-backed securities on the economy. They state that there is a legitimate case for considering various approaches to limiting this impact.


Passage number 483.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I’m sympathetic with your view that broader is better than narrower because of all the boundary issues that one creates.  I think we all are sympathetic with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Dudley, openly expresses agreement and sympathy with the view that broader is better than narrower.


Passage number 484.
 MR. FISHER.  For example, would you consider AAA industrial-grade credits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking a question and providing an example.


Passage number 485.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I think we would consider it.  The real issue is the Treasury’s willingness to use TARP money.  We can’t do any of this without the Treasury’s commitment, so we’re somewhat constrained in our ability to broaden it in the dimensions that we might want to broaden it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Dudley, is explaining that they would consider a certain action, but their ability to do so is limited by the Treasury's willingness to use TARP money.


Passage number 486.
 MR. PARKINSON.  We’ve heard from practically everyone that’s not within the class of consumer ABS and SBA loans.  We have heard from the commercial real estate people and from the auto dealers about their floor plan loans; we have heard from the banks that would like to get the motorcycles and leases.  But also corporate loans—the CLO (collateralized loan obligation) market also is shut down.  So there is no question.  Again, we’re in a hard place because, if we weren’t constrained in part by the TARP capital and our concerns about our balance sheet, we would maybe be able to have a much broader program in which we didn’t have to make these kinds of decisions.  But given that there’s only $20 billion of TARP capital and we’re willing at this point to go only to $200 billion, you can’t really say we’ll take all these different asset classes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the different groups of people they have heard from and the different types of loans they have discussed, as well as explaining the constraints they are facing in implementing a broader program.


Passage number 487.
 MR. HOENIG.  Which makes my point.  We really have to focus on fixing the intermediary process in the United States.  There’s no limit to this.  The refinancings coming due are huge.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing a point about the need to focus on fixing the intermediary process in the United States and highlighting the scale of upcoming refinancings.


Passage number 488.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s agreed and understood.  Again, the limits include the TARP capital, our own willingness with respect to the balance sheet, and so on.  There really are limits to what this can accomplish.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are limits to what can be accomplished.


Passage number 489.
 MR. PLOSSER.  But in some sense, just to follow up on this point, the limits are what is really important here because, as long as we don’t define some limits and we just say limited by TARP capital, well, that doesn’t really answer the question.  As long as the markets act as if we or someone else is going to step in and rescue them from any more lending arrangements they happen to be facing, the incentives for the intermediary system to repair itself or to gradually adjust are going to be limited.  I’m worried about the lack of definition about what constitutes a legitimate market or instrument or firm that we wouldn’t save.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing concern about the lack of definition regarding what constitutes a legitimate market or instrument or firm that wouldn't be saved. They are stating their opinion without engaging in an argument or disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 490.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s a good point, and I think one thing that is a problem now is the transition between Administrations.  We’ll soon have a new Treasury Secretary and a new Administration.  I think it’s very important—I’ve discussed this with Tim Geithner and others—that as soon as possible we lay out a broad strategy.  What are the components of our strategy.  What are we going to do going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents a perspective on the importance of planning and strategizing during a transition between administrations.


Passage number 491.
 MR. PLOSSER.  And what are the limits to it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question without any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


Passage number 492.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, implicitly, what are the limits to it.  How are we going to approach the banking issue.  What are we going to do about failing firms.  How are we going to try to address the securitization markets.  I think the more clarity we can provide—I fully agree with the critique that lurching is very bad, and we need to provide an overview.  There is a lot of sympathy from the new Treasury to do that, and we just have to overcome the fact that we’re in a transition at the moment.  But I take that point.  It’s a very good point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement of agreement and a discussion of addressing various issues related to banking, failing firms, securitization markets, and providing clarity.


Passage number 493.
 MR. PLOSSER.  By the way, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you.  I thought your exchange of letters with Senator Dodd, I guess it was, over the automobile issues was well done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude and compliments the Chairman's exchange of letters with Senator Dodd.


Passage number 494.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t think you read it, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is expressing an opinion about someone not having read something, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 495.
  [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  Excuse me, I read about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the interruption ("Excuse me") and the use of the phrase "I read about it," suggesting that the speaker is not in agreement with the information they read.


Passage number 496.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states that there are other questions for Bill without expressing any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 497.
 MR. LACKER.  I just want to raise two things that worry me.  One is that, when these programs are small, you subsidize X percent of the credit market.  The other 1 minus X percent, the effect on their rate of return, their borrowing costs, probably is small.  But when X gets near—I don’t know where it is now—⅓ or ½, then our subsidization is raising borrowing costs for everyone who doesn’t get money.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing concern about the impact of the subsidization on borrowing costs for those who do not receive money. He worries that as the percentage of the credit market that is subsidized (represented by X) increases, the effect on borrowing costs for non-recipients also increases. This suggests a disagreement or potential disagreement about the overall impact and fairness of the subsidization program.


Passage number 498.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s not clear.  The commercial paper market might be a counter-example to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "It’s not clear" indicates uncertainty or lack of clarity regarding a certain topic, and the statement that follows about the commercial paper market being a possible counter-example does not contradict or challenge that uncertainty.


Passage number 499.
 MR. LACKER.  There are some models in which that is the case.  It’s not obvious how we rule them out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that there are some models in which the mentioned scenario is possible, but it is not clear how those models can be ruled out.


Passage number 500.
  The second thing is—I don’t know how you evaluate this—you must be thinking whether this means that in every moderate-sized recession henceforth we’ll view the Federal Reserve’s best policy as extending— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s not a moderate recession, and it’s not a normal financial downturn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 501.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  Every recession of the size we’ve now seen 3 of in the last 50 years.  So every recession of that size.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker states a fact about the size and frequency of recessions without any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 502.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You have to have a deep recession and a financial crisis.  That’s pretty unusual.  Twice a century, or once a century so far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a phenomenon that is considered unusual, mentioning that a deep recession and a financial crisis usually occur only twice or once a century.


Passage number 503.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I’ll give you an example—the VIX has never been this elevated this long since the Great Depression.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement in the passage is a factual statement and does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply states a historical fact about the VIX.


Passage number 504.
 MR. LACKER.  So you’re saying that you’re not concerned about setting up expectations for the next recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 505.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly I’m concerned.  I’m very concerned.  But I’m also concerned about getting through this recession.  So those are the tradeoffs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 506.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple statement comprising a speaker's response indicating understanding or agreement. There is no observable contention or disagreement in the passage.
