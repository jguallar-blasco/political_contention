Passage number 1.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection. I regret to note that this FOMC meeting will be the last for our general counsel, Scott Alvarez.  Scott will be stepping down in a few weeks from his dual roles as the Board’s general counsel and the Committee’s general counsel, and he expects to retire shortly after that.  We will have the opportunity to celebrate Scott’s retirement tomorrow afternoon, but it’s also appropriate to recognize Scott’s contributions to the conduct of monetary policy here, in the context of an FOMC meeting. To start at the beginning, Scott received his B.A. from Princeton in 1977—in economics, I’m pleased to note.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states that Scott Alvarez will be stepping down from his roles as general counsel and is expected to retire shortly after. It also notes that there will be a celebration of his retirement.


Passage number 2.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But it didn’t take.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  After receiving his law degree from Georgetown in 1981, he joined the Board immediately, no doubt reflecting a deep desire to resume his association with economists, which I think all of us will find completely understandable.  Scott became a member of the Board’s official staff in 1989 when he was promoted to assistant general counsel, and two years after that he became associate general counsel.  In 2004, he was appointed general counsel both by the Board and by the FOMC.  All told, Scott has been with the Federal Reserve for 36 years.  Reputedly, Scott has quipped that he was born at the Board.  If that is really true, that implies that Scott is now age 36.  So he clearly has a long retirement to enjoy.  Following tradition, I might also note that, over his career, Scott has attended exactly 100 regularly scheduled FOMC meetings, counting today’s meeting.  It would be impossible to even begin to enumerate the areas in which Scott has made major contributions to the Federal Reserve.  He has truly been integral to virtually all areas of our responsibilities, but we cannot let this moment pass without acknowledging the particularly crucial role Scott played in the dark days of the financial crisis and its long, difficult aftermath. I’ve noted previously that Scott has advised successive Chairs, including myself, with deep expertise and utmost integrity.  Speaking for myself, I’m enormously grateful for his wise counsel, calm, and good humor during times of stress, and, above all, his intense dedication to the public interest served by the Federal Reserve.  Scott, we deeply appreciate all that you have done for the System and the nation, and we wish you all the best in your retirement.  [Applause] Regarding our formal agenda, our first item of business is to fill the upcoming vacancy in the position of the Committee’s general counsel.  As I think you know, the Board has appointed Mark Van Der Weide as its general counsel effective later this summer, and I would like to nominate him to also serve as the Committee’s general counsel.  I might note that Mark is seated there at the anteroom door. Mark earned his law degree from Yale Law School in 1995.  He worked in the Board’s Legal Division from 1998 to 2009.  In 2009 and 2010, he was detailed to the Treasury Department, where he contributed to the development of financial reform legislation.  Since 2010, Mark has worked in the Division of Supervision and Regulation, including most recently as deputy director.  Mark’s selection as the FOMC’s general counsel would be effective at the time he becomes the Board’s general counsel.  Scott Alvarez will remain general counsel until then.  Consistent with the Committee’s usual practice, the nomination is for Mark to serve as the  Committee’s general counsel until the Committee’s first regularly scheduled meeting in 2018.  Do I have a motion on this nomination.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a speech by Chairman Yellen praising Scott Alvarez and announcing the nomination of Mark Van Der Weide as the Committee's general counsel.


Passage number 3.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation:
The phrase "So moved" is typically used to indicate agreement or support for a statement or action. It does not suggest any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 4.
 MR. FISCHER.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And without objection.  Mark, congratulations on your selection, and best wishes with your new responsibilities.  Now I’m going to turn to Simon for our Desk briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage shows agreement and support.


Passage number 5.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kashkari is simply addressing Madam Chair (presumably Janet Yellen) while she acknowledges his presence.


Passage number 6.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you.  I have two questions.  Simon, on your exhibit 2, chart 11, bottom-left-hand panel, is there a respondent who is arguing that the reinvestment policy is going to lead to lower yields.  Is that what the little dots at the bottom of the page are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 7.
  MR. POTTER.  Yes, that’s correct.  It tends not to be from the dealers.  It comes from the buy-side respondents.  Do you see that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement of agreement and providing additional information.


Passage number 8.
 MR. KASHKARI.  I see it.  Okay.  And then in the 10-year Treasury yield—the third column—it looks like there is a group of investors who think there’s going to be a meaningful effect north of 50 basis points.  Do you have any color on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kashkari is simply seeking more information or clarification on certain data points.


Passage number 9.
 MR. POTTER.  Again, looking through the responses suggests that it’s mainly the dealers who think that.  About 9 to 10 percent of the dealer respondents think it could be north of 50 basis points.  We combine the results in the bin there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage is simply stating a fact or observation about the responses from dealers. There is no contention or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 10.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Do you have any sense on what the ranges are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply poses a question about a person's sense of knowledge.


Passage number 11.
 MR. POTTER.  The range, in terms of how high it could be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact or piece of information.


Passage number 12.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Meaning 50 basis points.  Is there a cluster.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not provide any context or information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement by Mr. Kashkari regarding a specific measure.


Passage number 13.
 MR. POTTER.  It’s 9 percent at 51 to 75 and zero after that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement made by Mr. Potter is a factual statement about the interest rate, which is 9 percent for amounts ranging from 51 to 75, and becomes zero for amounts above 75.


Passage number 14.
 MR. KASHKARI.  I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states Mr. Kashkari's observation without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 15.
 MR. POTTER.  But if you look at the mortgage option-adjusted spread, which is also in there, there’s one who thinks it could be higher than 75.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is simply stating that there is someone who thinks the mortgage option-adjusted spread could be higher than 75.


Passage number 16.
 MR. KASHKARI.  I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Kashkari sees something without further context.


Passage number 17.
 MR. POTTER.  You have two dealers who think it could be more than 50 for the Treasury yields and one who thinks the mortgage spread—even after the Treasury yields go up—could be more than 75 basis points. Now, one of the things to be wary of here is that the median estimate in the light blue on the right-hand side lines up exactly with people who have been following the Board staff estimates of the term premium, and we don’t know in our surveys whether we get back basically at the center.  Having the Desk ask the questions is complicated.  They may be thinking, “How  do we find an answer that doesn’t make us look stupid.”  Maybe we just go look at what they put out.  It’s hard to be sure.  We do have some colorful free responses, and you can read those in the survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different opinions and considerations regarding Treasury yields and mortgage spreads, but there is no direct conflict or disagreement between different parties.


Passage number 18.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions for Simon.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, we need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations conducted since the June meeting.  Do I have to motion to approve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is a simple request for a vote to approve domestic open market operations conducted since the June meeting.


Passage number 19.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Thank you.  Any opposed.  [No response]  No.  Okay.  Let us now proceed to the briefings, and David Wilcox will start us off on the domestic economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The participants all seem to be in agreement and there is no indication of any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 20.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question on financial stability and your staff judgment on levels of vulnerabilities.  As a kid I played “Red Light, Green Light.”  “Red light” meant stop, and “green light” meant go.  In Boston, it’s a little less clear.  [Laughter]  Neither the pedestrians nor people driving cars seem to have the same interpretation of what those colors mean.  But I do note that you judge the valuation pressures to be elevated.  And thinking about things that you  could do, you could vocalize concerns, you could tighten CRE guidance, you could think about countercyclical buffers, you could try to shrink a balance sheet faster or sooner.  When you look at a “red” for financial stability valuation pressures, is there any action that is implied.  And if there is an action, among the variety of things that you could possibly do, is there any prioritization the staff would use to think about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is a lighthearted statement followed by a question about potential actions related to financial stability.


Passage number 21.
 MS. KLEE.  I think the first thing to remember is that the QS assessment is just an assessment.  What we’re trying to do is highlight what the staff views as the important vulnerabilities facing the financial system.  I think that the regulatory framework we have in place, particularly in the banking sector, is resilient.  As you saw, the maturity and the liquidity transformation experienced by banks is relatively low, or at least it’s well capitalized.  In terms of specific guidance, I believe that what we have in place is probably okay, although perhaps Andreas knows if there’s something on the table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. KLEE is simply stating her thoughts and beliefs about the QS assessment and the regulatory framework in the banking sector.


Passage number 22.
 MR. LEHNERT.  I think the question is, what happens if these stretched valuations unwind abruptly, on the one hand, and what if they persist and elicit a binge of borrowing.  We have focused a lot over the past few years on the consequences of big moves in asset prices across a variety of different asset classes.  Among the major asset classes that we study, we are as confident as we can be that, we have traced through, to the extent possible, the consequences of those moves, and they don’t seem beyond the normal accelerator dynamics.  I think the premise of your question was that asset prices themselves might be an object of attention.  I don’t think that’s necessarily right when you think about the second-round consequences of a big shift in asset prices.  Then, on the borrowing side, as Beth showed, we think there aren’t really signs of any kind of acceleration in people taking on debt at this point, and we suspect that we’ll get plenty of warning should that come to pass.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 23.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just have a two-hander.  My understanding is that the “red” is just mechanical—if the evaluations are above X, it goes from “yellow” to “red.”  “Red” doesn’t really have the same meaning as a red light.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply explaining their understanding of how the term "red" is used in the context described.


Passage number 24.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  It’s supposed to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not state anything that indicates disagreement or contention. It appears to be a simple statement or response without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 25.
 MR. LEHNERT.  We’re sticking with the framework that we set up several years ago, although, in retrospect, maybe this is one area we would have chosen something with a little less of a deep association with danger and so forth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The phrase "although, in retrospect, maybe this is one area we would have chosen something with a little less of a deep association with danger and so forth" suggests that there is some disagreement or second-guessing about the framework that was set up.


Passage number 26.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a simple exchange of conversation without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 27.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Yes.  That was a good question.  I think there is a mapping from the overall assessment of vulnerabilities to the countercyclical capital buffer.  We have put that out in a rule, and so you would expect that if you saw a pattern of red flashing lights it would call for the beginning of the countercyclical capital buffer to be built.  In this case, the flashing red in the valuation pressures is strongly offset by some of the low judgments in the other categories, and that’s, at least in my observation so far, why it hasn’t mapped to the countercyclical capital buffer starting to be turned on, but that could change in coming months. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Brainard is simply providing an explanation and analysis of the situation, and Chair Yellen does not challenge or question her statement.


Passage number 28.
 MR. FISCHER.  The countercyclical capital buffer applies to the banks, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This is a straightforward question about the application of the countercyclical capital buffer to banks. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 29.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 30.
 MR. FISCHER.  And where do we think the sources of these pressures are.  From the banks, or what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is asking a question and does not express any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 31.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Presumably, the marginal investor purchasing one of these assets is paying above odds for it, and that marginal purchaser could be anywhere in the system.  It  doesn’t seem that he or she is using bank or actually any other debt financing to make that purchase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is stating a presumed fact about the marginal investor purchasing the asset, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 32.
 MR. FISCHER.  And when we intervened early in a leveraged lending case, were those only the firms we supervised, or was that more general.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question, so there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 33.
 MR. LEHNERT.  No.  The 2013 guidance applied to firms under U.S. federal supervision.  This is a joint Fed–OCC action.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states a fact about the 2013 guidance and joint action between the Fed and OCC.


Passage number 34.
 MR. FISCHER.  So if we wanted to issue a more general warning or express our concerns—lift our little finger when we drink tea with them, or whatever the accepted formulae are—we’d have to get together with some other regulators.  Is that right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer is simply asking for confirmation or clarification on how they would go about expressing their concerns or issuing a warning.


Passage number 35.
 MR. LEHNERT.  It depends.  That was a specific expression of concern regarding a specific set of loans that were being made by that set of institutions.  Presumably, it would depend on the facts and circumstances of the set of institutions that you are concerned about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining that the level of concern would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the institutions in question.


Passage number 36.
 MR. FISCHER.  Okay. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there may be other questions for President Bullard.


Passage number 37.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m looking at the International Outlook, exhibit 1, panel 4.  This is the euro-area Phillips curve from 2000 to 2017.  My question is, what is the natural rate of unemployment in Europe, and is it a time-varying object.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about the natural rate of unemployment in Europe.


Passage number 38.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  We do our own analysis, but we also look at the OECD estimates.  And so that is based on an OECD estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, which is actually relatively little time-varying.  It falls a little bit over the course of the period from 2008 to the present.  It has edged down about ½ percentage point at most and is a little bit under 9 percent.  So that’s the natural rate estimate for the euro area.  We have some skepticism about it, and we think that, in particular, because the estimate for Germany has fallen a lot, perhaps this estimate for the euro area should go down more than shows up in the OECD euro-area-wide estimate.  Of course, if it were the case that we adjusted the euro-area-wide natural rate estimate to make it go down more than the series we’re using, then that would actually make the conundrum even more difficult.  I’m sorry, that goes the other way.  So, yes, if the natural rate were actually lower, that would help explain a bit of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and expressing some skepticism about the OECD estimate. However, there is no explicit disagreement or argument being made.


Passage number 39.
 MR. BULLARD.  I mean, isn’t it shocking that we would say that a big economy like Europe has a 9 percent natural rate of unemployment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the natural rate of unemployment in Europe and expressing surprise or shock about it. There is no opposing view or argument presented.


Passage number 40.
 MR. KAMIN.  It is shocking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The statement "It is shocking" expresses a strong emotion or surprise, but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is merely an expression of the speaker's reaction to something.


Passage number 41.
 MR. BULLARD.  And the United States has a 5 percent natural rate.  400 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 42.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, let’s put it this way.  It’s shocking from the standpoint that a major part of the world’s economy has a natural rate that large.  Even if you adjusted it down to 8 or 7 percent, that’s still a very high natural rate.  In terms of why it might be so high, we think that that is explained by a legacy of quite a few labor market practices and structural features that support a high natural rate.  But that’s still a disappointing feature.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their opinion and explanation for the high natural rate, without contradicting any other viewpoint.


Passage number 43.
 MR. BULLARD.  Another question you could ask is, is inflation in Spain very different from inflation in Germany, in light of the fact that Spanish unemployment is double-digit and the German unemployment rate is low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting a question to ask regarding the difference in inflation between Spain and Germany in relation to their respective unemployment rates.


Passage number 44.
 MR. KAMIN.  It is different.  It is lower.  But what you’d call the cross-sectional Phillips curve—in other words, the differences between inflation and unemployment in Germany compared with in Spain and other countries—is not very steep.  That is, in some sense, another way to pose the issue that Paul Wood posed in his briefing last week, which is that,  notwithstanding incredibly low unemployment in Germany, its inflation is not all that much higher than the euro-area average.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply presents a statement about the differences between inflation and unemployment in Germany compared to Spain and other countries.


Passage number 45.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, we now have an opportunity for people to comment on financial stability.  A number of people have asked to do so.  Let’s start with the Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states that there are no responses or questions and then moves on to a different topic.


Passage number 46.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a few brief thoughts on the issue of financial asset valuation.  I agree with the staff, of course, that the valuations are high.  As I indicated by my previous comments, I’m not particularly worried that we happen to be in “red” territory.  In particular, the facts that stock prices are high and credit spreads are narrow seem, to me, to be supported by an environment in which the economy has been growing at a relatively steady pace and the global economic outlook has been improving.  And this has been happening at a time when the risk of recession seemed to be quite low.  So low volatility in the real economy should be expected to translate into low volatility in financial markets, and this in turn might be expected to lead to low risk premiums and valuations that are high by historical standards.  I’d be more concerned if the fundamentals were clearly inconsistent with the valuation metrics, or if the valuations were, as the staff suggested, accompanied by speculative mania or supported by high levels of leverage. In terms of valuation, I guess I spend most of my time worrying more about valuation in the market for Treasury securities than about equity market valuation.  The equity risk premiums are somewhat low compared with historical experience, but not unusually so.  In contrast, the 10-year Treasury yield of about 2¼ percent is quite surprising at a time when we’re close to full employment and are removing monetary policy accommodation.  The staff memo on the low  level of long-term rates explores this, with depressed term premiums being the major explanation.  In my mind, at least, depressed term premiums are another name for overvaluation. Finally, I appreciate the efforts of the staff to explore the issue of the low level of volatility in the equity market and whether this is potentially encouraging behaviors that create significant financial stability risk.  I generally agree with the staff’s conclusions in the memo.  But I want to add that there might be an additional avenue by which low volatility increases financial stability risk that goes beyond what was considered in that memo.  That’s the notion that lower stock market volatility may cause investors to increase their long exposures in the equity market.  Parenthetically, this issue has been raised by Frank Brosens, who is a principal at the hedge fund Taconic Capital Partners.  If you want to read about it, it has been highlighted in some of the recent issues of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer. The way it works is, if investors have a risk budget and volatility is low, then they can take on larger equity risk positions before that risk budget is exhausted.  By itself, that doesn’t seem to be particularly troublesome, because you would expect people could take on bigger positions if risk was low.  But consider that if the long equity exposures are growing as volatility is falling, this would tend to push the equity market higher, which in turn would tend to damp stock market volatility.  That’s because equity market volatility tends to be directional—low when the stock market is rising and high when the stock market is declining.  This raises a question of whether this all could unwind relatively quickly.  Think of the use of portfolio insurance at the time of the 1987 stock market crash.  Some external shock causes the equity market to decline.  This leads to a rise in volatility, which forces investors following this strategy to reduce their equity exposures, pushing down equity prices in turn and so pushing volatility up  further.  In principle, this could lead to a self-reinforcing dynamic on the downside.  Now, the key question, of course, is how large such volatility-driven positioning is in the equity market. We raised this issue in New York at a recent meeting of our buy-side advisory group.  Perhaps reassuringly, or perhaps not, the members of the group were not concerned about this.  My sense was that they did not view this type of strategy as very prevalent, and they thought that memories of the crisis were still limiting how far investors would take this, in terms of reacting to declines in volatility by raising their equity exposure.  Also, my sense was that they thought that there were other, better explanations to explain the level of equity market valuation than people chasing the lower volatility higher.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is mostly expressing agreement with the staff's views on financial asset valuation. They also share some concerns about the low level of volatility in the equity market and its potential impact on investors' behavior.


Passage number 47.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Financial Stability Committee met yesterday and discussed recent trends in commercial real estate, an area highlighted in the financial stability report as part of the evaluated valuation pressure.  Two primary areas were covered.  First, medium-sized banks in particular are continuing to increase exposures to commercial real estate despite deals that imply historically low capitalization rates.  It is worth recalling that banks exceeded CRE guidance in the last recession and experienced very high fail rates, raising the issue of whether additional supervisory actions may be warranted.  Second, valuations in the multifamily segment are particularly elevated.  This is a segment in which the GSEs have been quite active.  This observation may highlight the importance of pushing even harder for GSE reform that considers potential fallout for the multifamily commercial real estate sector.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting information and observations about trends in commercial real estate.


Passage number 48.
  MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The big news in the most recent assessment of financial stability is the judgment that asset prices are, for the first time in the short history of the QS, flashing red.  Of course, as the staff have pointed out, this is not as yet a particularly worrisome development, nor is it unexpected.  After several years of solid, if unspectacular, economic growth and no recession in sight, we would expect investors to be willing to accept risk at relatively low prices.  One might wonder if this confidence is misplaced, and particularly whether the current low level of the expected volatility might be a sign of deeper problems, which is an issue to which I will return. This is actually the second time in the current recovery that asset prices have shown preliminary signs of potential exuberance, as can be seen in the first chart in Beth’s presentation.  The first episode ended in 2015 after oil prices had peaked.  Concerns associated with the subsequent decline and broader worries about global economic growth led to a series of accelerating declines in various asset prices in 2015 and 2016.  By now, investors seem to have fully recovered their earlier enthusiasm and are once again flying, or at least until recently were accelerating, down the runways. In the pre-crisis episode, high and rising asset prices stimulated an erosion of lending standards and a credit boom, particularly among shadow banks.  This time around, banks appear not to be increasing their risk-taking materially, perhaps because of the post-crisis regulatory regime, particularly stress testing and tougher capital regulations.  The natural concern is that nonbank institutions will be prepared to supply riskier credit than the banks.  But as Beth showed, this doesn’t seem to be happening.  Commercial real estate loans packaged into securitizations have seen falling loan-to-value ratios and other signs of sensible risk management.  Some lending practices in the leveraged syndicated loan market remain  worrisome, but conditions are still less “frothy” than before banks implemented the 2013 leveraged lending guidance, and issuance of the riskiest corporate bonds remains subdued. Indeed, total credit to households and businesses has grown at most a little faster than income for three years now and shows no sign of accelerating.  To be sure, the rapid increase in business credit early in the recovery has left the riskiest firms quite leveraged and, hence, more vulnerable to shocks.  Although debt growth has been sluggish since 2015, the revival in asset prices over the past year or so suggests we ought to be on watch for a reacceleration of borrowing in this sector. While the financial system is well placed to absorb large drops in asset prices or other shocks, and because banks’ loss-absorbing capacities are substantially higher than in the pre-crisis environment—and those large standalone investment banks that survived the crisis have come inside the perimeter of bank regulation—a period of consolidation and reconsideration of the post-crisis regulations is now perfectly reasonable.  But any erosion of the core reforms—capital, liquidity, stress testing, or resolution—would leave us with a financial system that is potentially less transparent and more vulnerable. Now, to return to the issue of volatility.  Robert Shiller won the Nobel Prize for showing that stock market volatility had been too high, whereas now we are concerned that it is too low.  However, there is no simple variance inequality that would definitively establish that the financial markets are underpricing risk.  Rather, the concern over the low level of market volatility arose from the combination of historically low levels of expected volatility, as derived from prices of options on the VIX, coupled with anecdotes of increasing numbers of traders effectively betting that volatility would stay low or decline.  This is the process that Vice Chairman Dudley was describing.  This could lead to a downward spiral in which falling  volatility begets further decreases in volatility.  If traders pursuing these strategies are taking on more and more leverage, the day will come when market players realize that the process has gone too far and seek to move out of their positions, thus creating big losses hitting simultaneously across the financial system. The staff looked into this possibility to the best of their ability and concluded that it is indeed possible that such an effect could occur, but that the magnitudes of trading involved at present are too small to produce the decreases we have seen.  And, further, there is little evidence of capital flowing into these strategies in recent quarters.  From what we can tell, there has not been an appreciable increase in the leverage behind these strategies.  But, of course, this is the kind of dynamic that is, on occasion, only clear in hindsight, and those occasions are usually painful ones.  Hence, we need to keep watching, worrying, and issuing warnings when we believe the process has gone too far.  I suggest we keep digging, and that we do not refrain from issuing warnings when we believe they are needed and taking action, if we have any that we can take, when we believe that is needed and possible. That said, the current low levels of actual and expected volatility are consistent with an overall increase in the desire of market participants to take on risk.  The feedback loop at work here is much more familiar.  Rising asset prices lead to improvements in traders’ and financial institutions’ balance sheets, which lead them to take on more risk, and so on.  With that in mind, it is a good sign that participants acknowledge the risks of big price declines by, for example, demanding lower LTVs on commercial real estate loans in CMBS pools.  Further, our stress tests try to limit the inevitable procyclicality of the financial system by becoming tougher in good times.  In theory, the system is now designed to limit the spillover effects of a big drop in asset prices.  Although we have seen some episodes of stress in the past couple of years, the system  has, however, yet to face its really big test.  That will also be a really big test for us.

Passage number 49.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think my comments will be very consistent with what has already been said.  Low cap rates and high P/Es are, in my view, very much a function of very low 5-to-10-year interest rates.  The fact is, market psychology is now that rates will be lower for much longer than had been anticipated, and I think that psychology is becoming more strongly embedded in the markets.  Also embedded is a presumption that this expansion is sustainable because it has been fueled mainly by growth in income rather than by leverage.  So it has inherent sustainability, particularly because of the strength of the household sector. The effect of that, though—from what I hear anecdotally and as Vice Chairman Dudley said—is that among institutions, particularly foundations, endowments, and pension funds, this risk-budgeting approach is certainly much more prevalent than it was before.  We used to have a model that was called the “policy portfolio,” and many institutions, including one at which I used to be, are now migrating toward a risk budget instead of a policy portfolio.  And, low volatility, as the Vice Chair and Frank Brosens have pointed out, is a very key element of that.  So I do think we have to be on guard for either a buildup of leverage or for a buildup in risk without leverage that might occur in certain asset classes that are currently liquid but could become substantially illiquid in a selloff.  I think that is probably a bigger risk. I think these conditions that exist right now are likely to persist for some time, which is why I am glad that we are starting to unwind our own balance sheet.  I would not be sorry to see the ECB and other central banks also begin to unwind their balance sheets.  But I also believe, as has already been said, that it is critical that we keep strong macroprudential policies for big  banks and SIFIs and we carefully monitor the shadow system.  For example, I would be loath to see stress testing for big banks and SIFIs go to every other year versus every year.  I think that would be a move in the wrong direction and a dangerous step that I would not like to see us make.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 50.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My comments focus on the vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector as well as maturity and liquidity transformation risk.  Although the staff shading of these vulnerabilities is unchanged from the previous report, my own sense is that the foundation for these assessments could be shifting in ways that bear close monitoring. Recent estimates of the economy’s ability to withstand a significant negative shock to the financial system are reliant on the current quantity and quality of capital held by the U.S. banking system.  Indeed, this most recent QS report cites bank capital positions as a key factor for the current low risk assessment of financial-sector leverage.  Since the previous QS report, however, there’s been continued pressure from the industry to reduce capital requirements, and the potential for regulatory accommodation of lower requirements has surfaced.  And with the release of the CCAR results last month, the largest banks have announced plans to pay out substantially higher fractions of their earnings over the next year, and investors expect that to continue. Research suggests that after the transition to higher capital requirements, better-capitalized banks experience lower debt funding costs and faster loan growth.  These dynamics should lead to greater economic growth and more effective monetary policy transmission.  We should expect that a well-capitalized banking system that can withstand shocks accrues longer- term economic benefits in the form of a less severe and, therefore, less costly financial crises.  Because of that, we should be mindful that if current efforts to reduce existing capital stocks are successful, the financial stability outlook could deteriorate. Regarding vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation, I continue to hear from our insurance contacts in the region about pressures on their traditional business model that have led to new strategies.  For example, nontraditional liabilities and securities lending at insurance companies continues to increase, marking one area of concern.  This movement away from longer-term, stable sources of funding to greater reliance on short-term and alternative funding instruments, including those offered by Federal Home Loan Banks, should be carefully monitored.  Indeed, maturity transformation risk appears to be migrating from money markets to the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Ms. George, expresses her own sense that the assessments of vulnerabilities in the financial sector could be shifting, which suggests a disagreement with the staff's assessment. She also raises concerns about the pressure to reduce capital requirements and the potential for regulatory accommodation of lower requirements, which indicates a disagreement or contention over the appropriate level of capital held by the banking system. Additionally, she highlights the movement away from longer-term, stable sources of funding to alternative funding instruments, which implies a concern about the shift in maturity and liquidity transformation risk.


Passage number 51.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This QS report with the flashing red highlighted for me that I, for one, don’t have great clarity on the Committee’s reaction function as it relates to financial stability.  I think it relates to what some others asked about:  What would we need to see in this chart for us to take action.  And then what actions would we take, and what are the tradeoffs associated with them. When I think about it, there’s the countercyclical capital buffer, there are other types of guidance, and in the public there’s some speculation about whether we would raise rates if we’re concerned about asset prices.  Then there become tradeoffs against achievement of our dual-mandate goals, and I don’t have a good framework for thinking about how we trade off these various different objectives.  So I would welcome having either the staff or we as a Committee more formally taking this on.  We would be preparing now for what we would do if we saw these  different lights—what actions would be taken, and what the tradeoffs are.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Kashkari, is expressing his own lack of clarity and understanding regarding the Committee's reaction function as it relates to financial stability. He is calling for more formal discussion and clarification on the matter, but there is no direct contention or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 52.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you.  As Governor Fischer noted, valuation pressures are flashing red for the first time since the quarterly judgmental assessment was introduced three years ago.  This assessment is coupled with a deep dive into possible unwind and amplification risks associated with the exceptionally low levels of realized and implied volatility we’ve seen across asset classes in recent months, a topic that’s been prominent in my recent discussions with market participants.  Overall, however, financial stability risks continue to be assessed as moderate in light of low financial-sector leverage and maturity transformation and leverage in the nonfinancial sector that is now moderate. So what does that mean for monetary policy.  There’s an important distinction between deploying monetary policy in the service of financial stability and recognizing financial conditions as important considerations in calibrating monetary policy settings.  The kind of valuation pressures we’re seeing today can be expected to boost investment and spending, and if such a boost were to come at a time when it could overstimulate the economy and contribute to excessive inflation, the dual mandate would call for tighter monetary policy. Recognizing that we’ll return to policy deliberations tomorrow, I simply want to note that I support a change to our reinvestment policy at the next meeting if economic conditions evolve as we expect.  As that runoff gets under way, I’ll want to monitor financial conditions closely for signs that the expected tightening in long yields is, in fact, taking place.  Of course, as we heard earlier, one important determinant will be whether central banks in other major economies maintain accommodation, which could continue to offset the expected tightening here or instead  begin to reinforce our tightening, depending on the nature and timing of their normalization strategies. Let me turn from the question of financial conditions to financial stability.  We did have a discussion of this topic in April 2016, and I just want to review what we said at that time.  Most participants viewed the benefits of using monetary policy to address threats to financial stability as typically being outweighed by the associated costs in terms of deviations from our dual-mandate goals, but, of course, there were exceptions to that.  The question today is whether the elevated valuation pressures pose a sufficient risk of financial crisis in the future to merit monetary policy departing from what would otherwise—according to our dual-mandate considerations—be the appropriate path. I certainly share the concerns that valuation pressures are flashing red, but I don’t believe that test is close to being met today.  Instead, I think we, and the Board in particular, need to be very active and vigilant in carrying out our financial stability and supervisory responsibilities through macroprudential and microprudential policies, communication, and guidance. If we look at what we have seen historically, asset bubbles pose much greater risk to the economy when they are supported by high leverage.  So if we look across the analysis in the quarterly assessment, it’s notable that the valuation pressures are greatest in the equity markets, in which we traditionally have not seen as much association with leverage, and lowest for housing, the sector that has been the biggest problem in the past.  Besides equity valuations, valuation pressures in commercial real estate are also raising red flags, as President Rosengren mentioned earlier, and that is a sector that typically is associated with leverage here.  With regard to the portion of the financing of CRE held directly on the books of regulated financial institutions, the guidance that we issued earlier and subsequent supervisory efforts appear to have  had an important influence on the tightening of underwriting standards reported by the large systemic institutions.  But smaller institutions continue to evidence large concentrations of exposure, which may pose safety and soundness—although less likely to be financial stability—risks.  But with prices remaining elevated, we need to remain vigilant that institutions don’t become overly exposed to indirect channels as well as through direct lending. The quantitative assessment report suggests the concerns about elevated asset prices are balanced by robust capital buffers, as President George was discussing earlier.  Of course, those high capital levels and low levels of maturity transformation are not there by accident.  They reflect strong risk-based capital requirements, liquidity rules, resolvability requirements, and changes to money market funds, all of which have been instrumental in bringing these about. Additional guidance, as well as communications and a supervisory stress test on an annual basis as well as the countercyclical capital buffer also provide scope for reinforcing these safeguards if necessary.  But as memories of the crisis fade, public support for these safeguards appears to be doing the same.  Efforts to soften standards could contribute to the cyclicality of the financial system, and it’s precisely when asset prices are high that future losses are also most likely to be high and the loss-absorbing capacity of adequate capital buffers becomes most important.  So we need to remain vigilant, publicly highlight financial risks in areas in which we see them building, and steadfastly carry out our prudential responsibilities.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Is there anybody else who would like to comment on financial stability.  [No response]  Okay.  Why don’t we start our economic go-round.  We’ll have a few people, and then we’ll take a coffee break.  Let’s begin with President Mester.

Passage number 54.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Since our June meeting, the key spending data have met expectations, and they confirm that the economy has rebounded in recent months and the expansion remains on track.  I expect real GDP to grow a touch above 2 percent this year, on par with the average that we’ve seen over the past several years.  And, as I discussed at our previous meeting, given the trends in demographics and productivity, I estimate that potential GDP is growing only about 1½ percent per year.  Against that benchmark, the current pace of economic growth is actually quite strong and exceeds, by a sizable margin, its sustainable trend. Labor market performance has also remained solid in recent months and has generally surprised to the upside.  So far this year employment has increased, on average, about 180,000 jobs per month.  And as Governor Brainard mentioned, the pace of job growth in the private sector has been very good, about the same as last year.  Relative to population demographic trends, this robust pace is also unsustainably high.  Furthermore, job gains show few signs of slowing down, despite the fact that the unemployment rate is already below the  consensus range of estimates for the natural rate.  A variety of other indicators also point to a labor market that has exceeded full employment. All of this evidence of a very healthy labor market naturally raises the question of why wage growth has not returned to the rates that we typically associate with a strong labor market or a labor market at peak.  On that question, I’ll emphasize two points.  First, in relation to recent weak productivity gains and low price inflation, nominal wage growth really isn’t that slow, especially after factoring in the usual lags between labor market tightness and wage growth.  This conclusion is consistent with the evidence obtained from the wage models that were presented by the staff before the June meeting. Second, measures of wage growth continue to be held down by changes in workforce composition associated with demographics and a strong labor market.  As the labor markets continue to strengthen, many workers previously on the sidelines of the labor force or in part-time positions have been moving into full-time employment.  The vast majority of these new workers earn less than the typical full-time employee, so their entry brings down the average wage.  It’s just a matter of arithmetic. Updated calculations by my staff show that this compositional effect continues to hold down growth in the median weekly earnings measure by a little more than a full percentage point—a sizable effect relative to the normal expected gains.  Digging a little deeper into this compositional effect and leveraging the earlier work on the nonemployment index, or NEI, developed in conjunction with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond staff, my staff confirms that new hires are increasingly coming from groups that traditionally have low labor force attachment—again, a common feature of a very strong labor market.  The shift toward groups  with low attachment likely underlies the negative composition effect that’s suppressing wage gains. On balance, I view these developments as consistent with a labor market that is starting to strain its capacity.  I remain confident that such excess demand will push up inflation toward our 2 percent target.  There is no doubt that the recent price data have been disappointing, but they have been pushed down by several identifiable transitory factors.  In the second half of this year, I’m confident that we will be getting back to monthly inflation readings with an upward tilt that’s indicative of greater underlying pressures. Now let me turn to an assessment of financial conditions, which is a crucial backdrop for the forecast.  Here I want to make the point that a declining r*—the longer-run value of the real funds rate—is important for interpreting movements in asset prices and in calculating the wealth effect from these movements.  As I mentioned at our previous meeting, I lowered my own estimate of r* to ½ percent.  This change reflected both persistently low estimates from many macro models, including my own, as well as more recent evidence using term structure models.  The latest Tealbook forecast has also adopted the same lower r*, and the special Board staff memo provides an excellent—indeed, insightful—review of the relevant literature. In light of the term-structure evidence, it’s reasonable to assume that a very low r* is being priced into financial markets and the associated asset valuations that have been the subject of a lot of our conversation today.  In that regard, a separate Board staff memo on longer-term interest rates makes a good case that a low r* could partly explain why longer-term Treasury rates have changed so little, on net, since we began raising the federal funds rate target. Similarly, a low r* should push up prices across a range of assets, including equities, corporate bonds, and commercial and residential real estate.  In doing so, it can account for a  good portion of the apparently favorable measures of financial conditions we are seeing.  This is actually very easy to see in the QS report.  If you compare the levels of asset prices—like cap rates, stock market prices, or bond prices—with the equity premium or the adjusted cap rates, you see that we go from being at very high levels to being close to normal levels.  And if you do a simple calculation using asset price formulations, a calculation that you can do in your head, with a very low r*, you get higher P/E ratios in the stock market than you have historically, and it can explain why the P/E ratio today is very high. So it’s important to keep this channel in mind when considering the implications and potential wealth effects from higher asset prices.  Standard economic theory says that household spending responds differently to higher asset prices coming from a lower discount rate than from better economic prospects in the form of improved expected cash flows.  Higher expected cash flows generate an unambiguous positive wealth effect.  However, a rise in stock prices that’s due to a fall in r* generally has a much more modest implication for consumption because the path of real dividends remains unchanged. In other words, the source of the change in asset prices is critically important for assessing their effects on the economy.  My own interpretation is that a low r*, which is actually a reflection of negative news if you think about it—slower potential growth, less aggregate demand, if you will—is a key driver of high values in equity and real estate markets.  And one implication of that is, we’re unlikely to get a big boost in spending from what would seem to be very favorable financial conditions.  So my own forecast, as I mentioned earlier, is that I expect economic growth to continue to be about 2 percent and actually to slow to closer to potential next year.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Harker.

Passage number 55.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The incoming data since the previous meeting have left the outlook little changed but have also done little to resolve the uncertainty regarding inflation.  In sum, the economy continues to expand at a moderate but above-trend pace, and the labor market continues to tighten.  There is scant evidence at the moment that wage pressures are building or that inflation is moving up to our 2 percent objective.  Looking forward, with still-accommodative financial conditions, I do expect that we will continue to see above- trend economic growth and improving labor markets.  I also expect, albeit with less confidence, that inflation will move up toward target. Our high-frequency indicators continue to point to a rebound in real GDP growth in the second quarter, with continued solid gains in private domestic final purchases, as sources of strength appear to have shifted from residential and business fixed investment in the first quarter to personal consumption in the second.  The improvement in consumption makes sense, as the first quarter was held down by transitory factors.  Despite a weak retail sales report for June, I expect solid gains over the rest of the year, supported by ongoing labor market improvement.  I also anticipate that the resurgence in business investment that we’ve seen this year will continue, in light of strong fundamentals.  Synchronized growth in most major economies around the world offers some upside risk.  Overall, I see GDP continuing to expand at a moderate but above-trend pace over the remainder of the year. Regarding labor markets, the unemployment rate has fallen ½ percentage point over the past year, while participation has remained about flat.  With the strong June report over the first six months of this year, payroll employment gains have averaged 180,000 a month, about the same as last year, and this pace is consistent with a ½ percentage point drop in the unemployment rate over a year, assuming an unchanged participation rate.  On this path, the unemployment rate should decline to the low 4s by the end of the year, a bit below most assessments of the natural rate.  A tightening labor market should mean a gradual acceleration in wages and, ultimately, prices, but so far that is not in the data, although we are hearing more anecdotal evidence of difficulties in hiring.  As always, there is high uncertainty regarding the level of the natural rate as well as about the relationship between slack, on the one hand, and wages and prices, on the other.  Nonetheless, I continue to expect that unemployment will  decline a bit further and remain at low levels for some time, which could draw more workers into the workforce, put upward pressure on wages, or cause businesses to invest more as labor costs rise, all of which I would view as desirable outcomes.  In a sense, this is the place I have hoped for some time that we would eventually find ourselves. Turning to inflation, core PCE prices increased only 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and incoming CPI data suggest a similar reading for June.  The decline in inflation this year from the 1.7 percent rate seen last year has been a surprise, and the question is whether it is transitory or instead reflects more persistent factors, such as a lower trend inflation or more slack.  The Tealbook has inflation moving back up to 1.9 percent next year.  As explained in the staff memo, behind this forecast is the thought that this year’s unexplained weakness is the mirror image of last year’s unexplained strength.  That strikes me as a reasonable baseline, but the risks do appear to me to be tilted to the downside, particularly with wage pressures remaining moderate and inflation expectations still running lower than their pre-crisis levels.  With inflation generally running below our target for the past decade, it remains important that markets have confidence that the Committee will pursue policies that get inflation up to the 2 percent objective. Finally, a word on longer-term interest rates and financial conditions.  The Committee has been in a gradual tightening cycle since December 2015.  Longer-term rates, however, are about flat, on net, since the first rate increase.  Over the same 18-month period, on net, the dollar is weaker and equity prices are higher.  So overall, financial conditions are now looser than in December 2015, despite the four rate increases. The staff note lays out the many factors that are at play and attributes much of the 90 basis point downside surprise in longer-term rates to lower expectations for the longer-term  level of short rates and to lower term premiums.  The implications for policy depend on one’s views on the causes.  There is a risk that financial conditions are or will become too accommodative for the state of the economy, although I see no evidence of that today.  I also do not see an implication that monetary policy has been ineffective or that the Committee should be tightening more quickly.  I find the level of asset prices broadly to be high, but not alarmingly so, although it would not be a surprise if there were to be a correction.  I do think that the Committee will need to keep a close eye on asset prices and credit growth, as I will discuss tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Eighth District contacts continue to report business conditions consistent with steady growth.  Some businesses that have a significant international presence are reporting 2017 results somewhat above expectations as they stood earlier this year, but other businesses that are more or possibly exclusively domestically based are reporting only a modest rebound after a slow start to the year.  The District agribusiness sector remains weak, and that sector is not expected to improve meaningfully this year.

Passage number 57.
 Louis staff analysis looked at MSA-level prices and unemployment rates.  According to that empirical work, a 1 percentage point fall in the unemployment rate would be associated with an increase in PCE inflation of just 9 basis points.  I read this result as a further indication of how much the unemployment–inflation relationship has continued to soften in recent years.  As the unemployment–inflation tradeoff relationship  appears to be very weak, I do not think that the Committee should use the Phillips curve as the centerpiece of a preemptive normalization strategy. A year ago, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis adopted a regime-based approach to the thinking about the evolution of the U.S. economy.  That approach describes the current era as one of low economic growth, low nominal interest rates, and low inflation.  The regime-based concept suggests that current levels of these metrics on the U.S. economy will persist over the forecast horizon, and that there should be very little expectation of reversion to historical means in any of these variables, barring a major shock to the economy.  In particular, we suggested that real GDP growth would likely remain near its average of recent years of around 2 percent.  For all of 2016, the U.S. growth rate was very close to 2 percent, Q4 over Q4.  For the first half of 2017, the Q1 growth rate was 1.4 percent, and tracking estimates for the second quarter are averaging about 2½ percent.  That suggests a growth rate for the first half of 2017 of about 1.9 percent.  This seems quite consistent with the regime-based conception. Inflation readings have moved lower over the past several months.  Those data, combined with our policy rate moves in March and June as well as our plans for more policy rate moves in the future, have begun to put downward pressure on market-based measures of inflation expectations.  Carrying on this process too aggressively may cause the Committee to miss its inflation goal to the low side over the forecast horizon.  I see that possibility as potentially damaging to Federal Reserve credibility, as we’re well into an economic expansion when one would normally anticipate inflation goals could be attained through reasonable policy.

Passage number 58.
  MR. MULLINIX.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  New information since we last met has not changed my view of the current state of the economy, nor my outlook.  The labor market is tight and continues to tighten, but inflation has remained low.  My remarks will focus on these items, the two central components of our mandate. I found the staff memo a useful summary of what we can say about inflation over the short run.  The memo makes a compelling case that in the current environment, inflation behavior is mostly driven by temporary and idiosyncratic shocks, with resource utilization having only a limited effect on inflation.  That is, the Phillips curve is flat.  Of course, it may only remain flat over a range, so it’s important to assess the degree of resource utilization.  And here I believe that a wide range of indicators support the view that labor markets are tight now.  And according to the Tealbook’s forecast of employment growth, labor markets will get even tighter very soon.  For example, the unemployment rate is below estimates of its natural rate, and labor force participation is above estimates of its longer-run trend.  Job openings have exceeded their pre-recession levels for the past few years, and quits rates have now returned to their pre-recession levels.  But these indicators of tight labor markets are frequently discounted because we have not seen a substantial acceleration of nominal wages. Let me address this issue on two dimensions.  First, even though nominal wage growth has been moderate, real wage growth has exceeded very poor labor productivity growth, so that the labor income share of GDP has been increasing over the past few years.  This is significant because the labor income share tends to increase in well-established expansions, when labor markets are tight.  My staff has noted that, while the calculation of labor income shares for the aggregate economy is fraught with measurement difficullties, these difficulties are less prevalent if we focus on the nonfinancial corporate sector, which represents about two-thirds of the  business sector.  In this sector, the labor income share has increased steadily since 2014 and is now almost at pre-recession levels.  Strikingly, the magnitude of the labor share recovery is only somewhat smaller than what we saw in the boom market of the late 1990s. Second, the Tealbook notes that labor productivity growth tends to slow when labor markets are tight, perhaps because the productivity of new hires tends to be below the average of currently employed workers.  The same argument applies to the calculation of average wages.  The decline in the average quality of the workforce imposes a headwind on the growth in average wages, precisely in the face of labor market tightening.  My staff’s reading is that this countercyclical composition effect is well enough established to warrant consideration.  This suggests that we should discount measures of average wage growth and focus more on wage measures that try to correct for this composition effect.  The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker does just that.  And since 2015, it has been running at 3 percent or higher, which is significantly more than most measures of average wage growth. What we hear from our contacts in the Fifth District economy also supports the view that labor markets are tight, with the economy growing moderately.  For example, a manufacturer indicated that despite increasing wages, workers were so difficult to find that it was looking to cut production or move operations.  A steel manufacturer reported strong orders, which led it to increase wages and benefits in order to hire and retain workers and to spend more on capital improvements than it ever had before.  Beyond the labor market, a contact with a machine tool manufacturing association reported that orders were up year-to-date in the Southeast as well as nationwide, and that it was expecting orders to increase this year for the first time in three years.  More generally, our latest survey results indicate that activity in the manufacturing and service sectors increased at a solid pace in July.  To conclude:  There’s been ample discussion of the possibility of a Phillips curve that is flat now but may turn steep.  I believe this is best viewed as a matter of risk management.  In that regard, with the real funds rate negative, my concerns lean more toward resource utilization being too close to the edge than about inflation not being close enough to the target.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.

 MR. BOSTIC.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The sentiment of my directors and contacts regarding the business outlook was little changed from previous cycles, as most continue to describe a moderate growth environment.  The post-election optimism regarding new pro-growth policies coming out of Washington continues to erode, but we don’t get any sense that the declining sentiment is likely to result in a setback to the pace of business activity.  The effect of  eroding confidence in policy changes is, according to our contacts, simply more certainty that the upside potential to the economy is unlikely to materialize. There are pockets of concern about activity from some familiar sources.  For example, consistent with reports from my colleagues today, my director report representing a large, nationally based retail auto organization noted that 2017 will be the year when the string of one record sales year after another will be broken.  He warned that production has not aligned with that reality, and he expects to see a much longer plant closure and retooling cycle this year in response. Overall, however, the anecdotal reports we received in this cycle are consistent with our tracking estimates that suggest that first-half 2017 real GDP growth will come in near the recovery average.  For now I feel relatively comfortable with my GDP growth forecast, which is essentially the same as the median forecast in the June SEP. I feel no such comfort with my outlook for inflation or the related issue of the degree to which labor markets are tight.  I think there is something in the official statistics for both sides of the “tight versus not too tight” debate.  On the tight side, even the broad measures of the unemployment rate seem clearly at or below the pre-crisis norm.  Available persons per job opening—which is available persons being measured as the number of people in the BLS household survey who report they want a job—is at its lowest level since at least 2001.  And I want to thank First Vice President Mullinix for highlighting my Bank’s Wage Growth Tracker, which has been showing stronger wage growth than other reports are showing. On the other hand, the not-too-tight case is, I think, supported by the fact that the participation rate has moved upward against this downward demographic trend and the fact that labor compensation growth is showing no sign of acceleration.  In this cycle, we pushed our  contacts and directors pretty hard on their views about the condition of labor markets, but, more importantly, we probed on the question of exactly how they are reacting or planning to react on those perceptions.  To be sure, many businesses across a wide variety of sectors expressed their belief that labor markets are tightening, and we hear many reports of firms stepping up their efforts to attract and retain employees by offering a wide variety of nonwage and salary benefits such as flexible hours, access to amenities, in-house services, and various quality-of-life programs. That noted, it was striking that absent in our conversations with contacts is much of any mention of concerns over wages.  The majority of District contacts still plan broad-based wage growth in the 2 to 3 percent range, consistent with what we have seen in the national numbers. Pay increases above that range seem to be generally associated with specialty skilled workers and in pockets of high demand, such as housing.  And, for the most part, we do not hear that employment growth and business activity are constrained by the lack of available qualified labor, again, outside of a few cases such as nursing services or residential construction. The overall sense I get is that businesses are still averse to broad-based wage increases because they are uncertain about future demand, and labor market conditions do not seem to be consistently pushing them to abandon their aversion to structural wage increases.  I’ll emphasize again that there’s plenty of sentiment out there that it is only a matter of time before the benign wage environment gives way, but, for now, I don’t see a lot of evidence in the actions of our contacts that suggest that time is imminent, which brings me to my inflation outlook. At the previous FOMC meeting, I noted my concern regarding a few recent weak inflation reports.  Now I’m puzzled and perhaps a bit troubled, as the few reports have now turned into something that looks more like a trend.  As with wages, we spend a lot of time asking  our contacts about their views on pricing in their businesses and sectors.  I wouldn’t say that we heard much in the way of beliefs that the pricing environment has dramatically shifted into disinflation mode.  So I’m sympathetic to exhibit 8 in today’s staff presentation on the U.S. outlook which shows “other factors” as the primary driver of the weakness in the recent inflation numbers.  In essence, I’m tempted to shrug my shoulders and say, “Stuff happens.” On the other hand, with just a few exceptions, we did not hear anything in expectations about costs, market tightness, or perceived pricing power that would suggest a dramatic acceleration of inflation and would constitute an upside inflation risk.  To be completely honest, I’m thankful that we’ll get two additional reports before our next forecast round.  If I had to submit an inflation forecast today, it would look a lot like the markdown we saw in the Tealbook and perhaps be even more pessimistic than that regarding 2018.  However, on the basis of the evidence in hand, I’d have to give serious contemplation to shifting my balance of risks for inflation to the downside, and the probability I am placing on that downside scenario is increasing.  That is weighing on my thoughts about the appropriate policy path, but I will defer that discussion to tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily presents the speaker's observations and analysis of business outlook, labor markets, wage growth, and inflation, without any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 60.
  MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I would have preferred to announce the beginning of balance sheet normalization at this meeting.  While that is clearly not going to occur, I would be worried if we do not take action on the balance sheet at our next meeting.  Pushing down longer-term interest rates when the economy was very weak was a sensible policy that I strongly supported.  But with a forecast that overshoots full employment, likely by a substantial amount; with most financial conditions, including longer-term interest rates, easing in the wake of our first tightenings; and with concerns that the low interest rate environment may be encouraging excessive valuations in some markets, we should not further delay the balance sheet announcement. A concern may be that such an announcement will be disruptive to financial markets.  However, this action has been clearly signaled since the March meeting.  The mechanics have been well explained, and market participants seem to understand that great care has been taken to make it a nonevent for market participants.  On the other hand, it is possible that debt ceilings and budget talks may provide a more turbulent environment than we currently are experiencing.  While the possibility of such turbulence was a good reason to move up the announcement, I do not view it as a reason to delay action further, as the announcement has been structured to be boring even by central bank standards.  We need to continue gradually and steadily removing accommodation.  The risks seem unduly tilted to running the economy too hot, and we should be taking out insurance against that risk, deviating from that path only in response to a very material change in the forecast. I support both changes in the statement language that send a signal that we will be announcing a change in balance sheet policy in September.  In fact, I would have supported language that made that outcome even more certain.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, expresses support for announcing a change in balance sheet policy and emphasizes the need to remove accommodation gradually and steadily. He also expresses a preference for making the announcement in September and suggests that the risks are tilted towards running the economy too hot. Overall, there is a clear alignment in the speaker's views.


Passage number 61.
 MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written at this meeting, and I favor the latest change to paragraph 5.  I think the use of “relatively soon” will avoid my concern that the original language would move market expectations of normalization from September to December.  So I’m all for “relatively soon.” CHAIR YELLEN.  And “For the time being”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. Harker and Chair Yellen express support and agreement with the decision and the changes made.


Passage number 62.
 MR. HARKER.  I think the one change in the language would suffice.  I wouldn’t strongly object to the addition of that, but I’m not sure it’s necessary if we just say “relatively soon.” September is not that far off, and if we want to avoid surprising markets and preventing the associated risk accompanying that surprise, then the added signal given in the revised language should greatly ameliorate that possibility.  If markets are looking toward September, we keep open the possibility of a rate increase in December if conditions warrant.  I don’t believe that any of us are in favor of simultaneously starting balance sheet normalization and raising rates.  I am not. The economy appears to be growing above trend, and labor market activity remains robust.  Our initial planned changes to the balance sheet are very conservative, and the path to normalization is exceedingly gradual, implying little effect on economic outcomes.  As well, beginning normalization should signal our underlying confidence in our outlook, and I believe that we should start the process in the very near future—that is, September.  That said, the consistent shortfall of inflation from target is troubling.  I am on record for supporting three rate hikes this year, but I may need to reconsider that position if the likelihood of the staff’s and my  forecasts for a gradual rate of return of inflation to target starts to wane.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their views and opinions, but there is no direct opposition or argument presented.


Passage number 63.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As usual, I’ve enjoyed reading the Tealbooks and have been impressed by the skill of the staff in providing us with plausible accounts of what may be happening in the economy.  I’d like to thank them for their devoted work and efforts to come up with new and useful insights on the policy rate paths that are being discussed, among them the use of the double normal distribution that puts more weight on upside risks to unemployment than on downside risks and, of course, the explicit reduction of 50 basis points in the estimate of r*. Perhaps because we do not plan on making any changes to policy at this time—I’ll leave aside the announcements—I have been somewhat uncertain what conclusions to take away from the many interest rate, inflation, unemployment, and economic growth strategies that appear in different parts of the Tealbook, particularly the blue- and black-edged pages, pages 71 to 114 of Tealbook A.  Since our June meeting, the unemployment rate has essentially stayed constant at a satisfactory level, and the rate of inflation has essentially stayed constant at a somewhat unsatisfactory level, about 50 basis points below target.  The staff continues to believe that we’re dealing with a temporary decline in inflation and that there’s no great need to change course.  I continue to agree with that view, which is to say that I support alternative B.  However, we do need to ask ourselves how long “temporary” is and what we will do if this temporary adjustment drags on for too long. In some cases, the trajectories are the results of an optimal control approach, with a range of loss functions specified on page 113 of Tealbook A.  Perhaps in those and other cases, we  could use utility functions to tell us which trajectories produce the optimal outcomes, but we would have to decide on what is the mother or father utility function by which we evaluate all of the paths.  Or, to put a related question on the table, what is the connection between what our research can tell us about the expected outcomes of alternatives A, B, and C and all of the trajectories presented in Tealbook A.  How is what we do connected to the very professional and very interesting analyses in Tealbooks A and B, in fact. Well, aside from the foregoing professorial remarks, I have only two points of substance.  First, the nominal income-targeting approach discussed in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of Tealbook A is too complicated to be useful.  It is used in the July Tealbook to start with a large deficit on the price level such that the inflation rate reaches 2 percent very quickly.  But unless there’s good reason to choose the starting date and it can thereafter be taken either as a constant or as the outcome of the process that allows individuals to figure out where the path will lie in future years, it inherently produces a path with large uncertainty.  Consider, in particular, what people are supposed to assume in an economy coming off a period of inflation overshooting, which will require policy to be tight for some time.  How will anyone know what the target nominal income level would be.  And not to mention the problem of data revisions, which are particularly problematic in the case of GDP. I do not support price-level targeting, but I do believe that whatever benefits nominal income targeting in the form presented in the July Tealbook might bring would easily be better achieved by a policy that targets the price-level path.  But the main difference between GDP targeting or price-level targeting and the inflation-targeting approach is that the level approaches place the burden of past errors fully on current and future policy, a burden that no one now  assumes policy should automatically carry and which could only complicate our lives rather than increase our utilities. The second point of substance:  As I discussed at the previous meeting, I believe the best approach to starting to reduce our balance sheet would have been to announce today that we will start the process in the month of September.  Why do that.  Well, President Rosengren has already given us a good explanation of that, and, as Vice Chairman Dudley said yesterday, we’ve persuaded market participants that we’re going to start very small, sufficiently small that the reductions in the balance sheet will hardly be noticed in the trading following the start of our change in policy. I fear that the amount of ink that has been spent—some of us print things out, although I know most of you don’t—on spelling out what we will do when we start is already fogging up the outlook.  My preference would have been to clear away the fog and get on with actually starting the rundown of our balance sheet.  But in the interest of comity, I can support alternative B today.  Now, you’ll say, “What is ‘comity’.”  Well, the ever-useful Google says “1.  An association of nations for their mutual benefit.”  This is not the intended meaning.  “2.  Courtesy and considerate behavior toward others.”  That is the intended meaning.  [Laughter]  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 64.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B and the statement language.  I believe the current medium-run outlook, progress on our dual-mandate goals, and the risks to the outlook support the Committee’s strategy of gradually normalizing interest rates and the balance sheet.  I view alternative B as consistent with this approach, an approach the Committee has been communicating for some time as appropriate.  I appreciate the change that was made to paragraph 5 after Tealbook B was closed.  If sufficient groundwork had been done, I would have supported announcing today that we were embarking on our balance sheet normalization plan.  But, given that, I strongly believe signaling that the Committee expects to change its investment policy and embark on its balance sheet plan “relatively soon, provided the economy evolves broadly as expected” is the appropriate thing to do at this point, as we’re aiming to change our policy at the September meeting.  First, it’s consistent with our aim to be transparent.  Second, it removes some of the ambiguity about our policy.  As I said yesterday, reports from business contacts suggest that political and fiscal policy uncertainty is beginning to affect the economic decisions of some businesses and households.  It seems to me that it behooves us to remove ambiguity about monetary policy to the extent that we can.  Using the “relatively soon” language that Chair Yellen used in her recent testimony engenders some consistency and helps avoid speculation that our intentions have changed. And, third, I think that by including the language today, we minimize the chance of an oversized reaction in September.  If we don’t signal today, as we come into September, there’s going to be a lot of public discussion of the debt ceiling, and that could increase ambiguity about our September decision.  In addition, the ECB meets on September 7, and there’s some speculation that it could announce some reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  If we then announce the start of balance sheet normalization in September without having signaled in advance, we may trigger the very type of reaction in financial markets we’re attempting to avoid. Regarding whether to add language in brackets at the start of paragraph 5—that is, the “For the time being” phrase—I’m agnostic.  However, I agree with the Chair.  I wouldn’t want it to be used in lieu of adding “relatively soon,” which the Chair used at the hearing.  Why mix signals now and risk increasing ambiguity rather than reducing it.  Now, all of this is predicated on our medium-run outlook remaining largely intact—that is, that economic growth is at or above trend, labor markets remain strong, inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, and inflation moves gradually back up to our goal of 2 percent on a sustained basis. One of the benefits of the gradual nature of our interest rate and balance sheet normalization strategy is that it allows for fluctuations in the data that we’ve seen without necessitating a change in strategy.  Had we opted to pursue a more aggressive strategy, it might have needed to be adjusted more in the wake of changes and conditions.  Instead, we’ve been able to follow a consistent strategy even as the data have fluctuated.  In a sense, the gradualness of the strategy has already taken into account some of the fluctuations we’ve seen in the data, so we’ve been able to be consistent.  This consistency has a benefit:  It helps demonstrate that we set policy systematically, and that we focus on the medium-run outlook and aren’t going to react to small fluctuations in the data that don’t materially change the outlook. Now, in my view, economic developments we’ve seen continue to support the outlook and gradual normalization.  But we always have to consider the alternatives, and I acknowledge that we could have the inflation outlook wrong.  It’s hard to forecast inflation.  We’ve been undershooting our 2 percent inflation goal for some time.  And perhaps the recent data readings are indicating the beginning of a longer-lasting deterioration in inflation and inflation expectations.  If evidence accumulates that inflation expectations have materially reversed course, then I don’t think delaying interest rate increases a couple of meetings is going to have much effect on inflation.  And, as we discussed yesterday, there may be financial stability implications.  So in this scenario, it would seem that we would need a more significant change in strategy.  Although this isn’t my modal forecast, it is worth thinking about what actions,  communications, and/or change in framework would be most effective in raising inflation expectations and moving inflation back to our goal if we find ourselves in such a scenario of a deteriorating inflation outlook.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And I want to recognize Governor Fischer to just make a brief addition to his previous statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. MS. MESTER supports alternative B and the statement language, and she provides reasons for her support. She also acknowledges the potential for alternative scenarios and discusses the actions that would be needed in those situations. However, there is no indication of disagreement or argument with any other person or viewpoint in the passage.


Passage number 65.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks very much, Madam Chair.  I wanted to comment on the “For the time being.”  I believe “relatively soon” definitely ought to be there, and I’d prefer “For the time being” being there because it’s a nice way of getting people to actually read the thing.  “Oh, ‘For the time being’—what the heck does that mean.” Then they’ll read the rest of the paragraph. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bostic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer is simply expressing his opinion and preference for including certain phrases. Chair Yellen acknowledges his comment with a thank you.


Passage number 66.
 MR. BOSTIC.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Under my outlook and current assessment of risks, I support the policy action in the alternative B statement.  However, as I noted in the economy round, I think the lack of clarity regarding the inflation situation is troubling.  Because of the uncertainty about how the inflation outlook is going to evolve, my chief concern is that we retain conditionality and that this is understood more broadly in the market. For that reason, I am sympathetic to the inclusion of language in the spirit of paragraph 3 of alternative A.  In addition to saying that we are monitoring inflation developments, this language says we’re taking seriously the possibility that the recent weak inflation readings will persist.  I think adding this language better positions us for a moderation in the expected path of policy, if that appears warranted when we reach the September meeting.  That said, my current projection still has one additional rate hike this year, but this action is conditional on my being more confident that the inflation rate will actually recover its movement toward our policy  objective over coming months.  So I’ll be keeping my eyes trained on that in the next two months. Regarding the balance sheet, I’m in favor of beginning normalization in September.  My concerns that the possible weak inflation may not be transitory are real, but the gradual introduction of this program makes me confident that we should begin this, and that there is likely to be minimal disruption. I agree with strengthening the signal and support the inclusion of “relatively soon” in paragraph 5 of alternative B.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 67.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  The inflation picture has not improved since we met last month.  If anything, the incoming data have made me more nervous about the persistence of the low readings.  So I think it’s particularly important at this juncture that the Committee avoid actions or communications that could be read as a lack of concern over the inflation outlook. Indeed, for expressing the inflation concerns, like President Bostic, I found some of the language in alternative A quite attractive, particularly the paragraph 3 commentary that policy is on hold in order to determine the persistence of the recent low readings on inflation.  That well summarizes my current strategy.  That said, I can support alternative B.  Even if not as forceful as alternative A, I think alternative B will firm market expectations regarding a plan that announces the beginning of balance sheet normalization at our September meeting and puts interest rate moves on hold as we assess the outlook for inflation. If we see inflation beginning to move up in the fourth quarter, I could see raising rates in December.  That said, I am more concerned that we will find ourselves in December with core  inflation still stuck at 1½ percent, and I would find it very difficult to support a rate move if inflation is not clearly improving.  We cannot risk being viewed as capitulating on our symmetric 2 percent target. So I support alternative B today as written and, barring any sharp deterioration in the economic growth or inflation outlooks, the current plans for a September commencement in the balance sheet normalization.  I favor the single change to paragraph 5 involving “relatively soon.”  I think that’s adequate.  Beyond the balance sheet changes, further rate hikes are going to be a tough sell until we see solid evidence that the recent declines in inflation are indeed transitory, and that the path to our symmetric 2 percent target is more firmly in place.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Mullinix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Evans expresses his support for alternative B and explains his concerns about inflation. He states that he finds some aspects of alternative A attractive but ultimately supports alternative B. He also mentions the possibility of raising rates in December if inflation improves, but expresses apprehension about doing so if inflation remains low. Overall, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 68.
 MR. MULLINIX.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My outlook for appropriate policy in the coming months has not changed from the assessment reflected in my SEP forecasts in June.  That outlook included two more rate increases this year.  With inflation close to our target, the case for continued rate increases did not rely on the level of inflation.  Rather, it was based on the economy having essentially achieved full employment while the real federal funds rate remained negative. The economic outlook has not materially changed in recent months, although the continued fast pace of employment growth has been notable.  The softness of inflation has persisted more than I had expected, but I agree with the Tealbook in seeing this as largely due to temporary shocks to specific price categories.  Even so, I recognize that the question of whether we are experiencing persistent low inflation is a legitimate one.  While today my concern leans more toward resource utilization being too close to the edge than inflation being too far from  target, incoming data will be informative about these two risks and about the appropriate pace of further rate increases.  Therefore, I support policy alternative B and would include both proposed revisions to paragraph 5.  In that regard, I believe we have positioned ourselves to carry out balance sheet normalization in a way that is largely independent of the path of interest rates.  Accordingly, I believe we should announce the beginning of normalization in September, with the actual start of redemptions coming shortly after that announcement.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their outlook and supports a specific policy alternative.


Passage number 69.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  Let me say first that I support both pieces of the blue language.  I would be in a similar place to Governor Fischer, which is that I think “relatively soon” is both more important and pretty straightforward.  But I would also support the inclusion of “For the time being,” in order to help remove any remaining doubt. The Committee has carefully communicated the plan to begin to shrink the balance sheet.  The market has accepted the move as one carefully designed not to provoke much of a reaction.  Therefore, I continue to believe that beginning normalization of the balance sheet in September will be appropriate, perhaps with delayed effect until November 1 if a significant debt ceiling impasse threatens. Although incoming data have yielded a few mild surprises, the economy remains on about the same trajectory.  Inflation is the main source of uncertainty.  Over the past several years, the staff’s inflation models have fit the data pretty well.  The current baseline forecast is that inflation will move up close to 2 percent in 2018, because the recent inflation weakness is largely due to transitory factors.  As I said yesterday, I find that plausible.  But if inflation is  weaker than expected, it might not be wise to raise rates further in December.  That decision, of course, is not before the Committee today. The Committee will also need to carefully balance our continuing exertions to move closer to our inflation target with the need to safeguard financial stability.  Over the intermeeting period, the staff have raised their assessment of the valuation pressures in financial markets to the red level, although other areas of financial stability assessment remain at more moderate levels.  The staff’s analysis also suggests that it is likely that credit growth will accelerate, reflecting current levels of risk appetite. The tradeoff between inflation and financial stability is not a difficult one today for me, but it may become so.  Some argue today that we’re “behind the curve” on financial stability and should tighten, while others argue that we’re, in effect, “ahead of the curve” on inflation and should stop tightening.  I see both of those as real risks that point in different directions, and I think that our current policy path represents an appropriate balance between them that will need careful monitoring.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Powell expresses his support for alternative B and explains his reasoning. He also discusses his views on inflation and financial stability, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 70.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for today, with a few caveats.  I think, generally speaking, the Committee is in fairly good shape for now.  I am supportive of going ahead with ending reinvestment in September, provided there are no large surprises on the economy.  I do support, accordingly, the blue language in paragraph 5—both the “For the time being” language and the “relatively soon” language. I remain doubtful that we need to plan for preemptive moves on the policy rate in order to meet our policy goals over the forecast horizon.  As of today, it appears unlikely that the inflation situation will change markedly by the end of the year.  And on this dimension, I support  President Bostic’s suggestion to use paragraph 3 of alternative A instead of the way it’s written in alternative B.  I think that’s a good idea.  President Evans commented on that as well.  I think that’s something to consider.  The Committee, in my view, will likely be on pause through the end of the year and into 2018, based on the inflation situation. I’d like to reiterate to the Committee that the U.S. price level has fallen about 4.5 percent off the price-level path established between 1995 and 2012.  If you draw a line through the price level from 1995 to 2012, it’s about 2 percent.  But we’ve fallen off that path since then, and that looks likely to get worse as we go through the end of the year.  That suggests to me that the future might call for a reassessment of U.S. monetary policy strategy along the lines of price-level or nominal GDP targeting, as was discussed by the staff in the Tealbook.  If we were going to do something like that, that would be a major change in strategy, but it may be time that we start thinking about that more carefully. Barring a major change in strategy, I think our approach as we go forward should be to move to a description of the current level of the policy rate as appropriate for today, and that the current level of the policy rate may remain appropriate over the forecast horizon, barring large changes to the U.S. economy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses support for some aspects of alternative B, but also suggests a different approach for paragraph 3 and discusses the possibility of a major change in strategy for U.S. monetary policy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 71.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with both amendments to paragraph 5.  I believe we should announce the start of the wind-down of our balance sheet in the September meeting, and I think this new language sets us up more clearly to communicate that.  Regarding President Bostic’s suggestion, for myself, I’m at least one meeting away from being ready to adopt that language.  I’d like to see more data over the next couple or  three months before we adopt the language in paragraph 3, alternative A.  I might get there eventually, though. Regarding further increases in the federal funds rate, I intend to be patient and await further information that confirms we’re continuing to make progress toward meeting our 2 percent inflation objective.  I do believe the cyclical forces are tilted to creating inflation pressure.  However, I also believe that the secular forces are powerful and are likely muting inflation pressures, so I intend to observe closely how these forces unfold. I’m struggling with a dilemma, which I’ve talked to a number of you about, and I’ll just mention it.  On the cyclical side, pressures are building.  There’s no doubt the labor market is tightening.  I think it is leading to growing labor shortages, and I think, on a like-for-like basis, it’s leading to wage pressure, if you carve out the compositional factors that we talked about yesterday.  These forces are certainly susceptible to monetary policy—that is, a higher federal funds rate would tamp this down.  On the other hand, my strong view is that the secular or structural forces are very powerful, and, in my view, they’re intensifying.  Technology-enabled disruption is intensifying, and the effects of globalization, to a lesser extent, are also strong.  These are leading to a loss of pricing power—which is widespread, in my view—and a muting of inflation pressures.  These secular forces are not so easy to measure.  They’re also not particularly susceptible to influence by monetary policy. So as we look ahead, one scenario would be, if we allow the cyclical pressures to build because we’re not meeting our inflation target, businesses will face more labor shortages.  That should lead to more wage pressure and should lead to margin erosion.  To reduce these pressures, businesses will do what they’re doing now:  They will step up their investment in technology to reduce the reliance on workers and to lower their costs.  This cycle may not be all bad, but I’m  not sure.  Low interest rates may also lead to other unhealthy imbalances building in financial markets, ultimately leading to growing risks that may be difficult to unwind and prudently manage.  And at a certain point, I think, this could be dangerous, particularly if we don’t maintain and keep strong macroprudential policies. So, what I’m talking about with my team and others around this table is, first, do you agree with this cyclical versus secular dilemma.  I don’t think everyone does, but I think it’s worth debating.  And, second, if you do agree with this dilemma, how should we be thinking about it from a policy point of view.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. Mr. Kaplan expresses his support for alternative B with amendments to paragraph 5 and his hesitation to adopt President Bostic's suggestion. He also discusses the dilemma he is struggling with regarding cyclical and secular forces and how it affects monetary policy. This suggests a disagreement or different perspectives on the appropriate course of action.


Passage number 72.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, including the updated “relatively soon” language in paragraph 5.  I think it is stronger and sufficient of a signal of our intent, so “For the time being,” I think, could be dropped. Based on the current economic outlook and the well-communicated balance sheet reduction plans at the June meeting, I could have easily supported an announcement to begin ceasing reinvestments today.  My outlook calls for further gradual adjustments to the funds rate.  Whether that path should be altered in light of the tension between ongoing strength in labor markets and soft inflation readings will depend on the influence of incoming data on those projections. I would note that during the first half of this year, labor markets have tightened faster than expected, lowering the median SEP for the unemployment rate at the end of 2018 from 4.5 percent in the December 2016 SEP to 4.2 percent in June.  While inflation data have come in softer than expected in the first half, the well-noted influence of transitory factors has resulted in no change to the SEP forecast of core PCE inflation of 2 percent in 2018.  The Tealbook forecast  of core PCE inflation for 2018 is also unchanged over the past two meetings.  And, as the Board staff’s memo illustrates, numerous factors influence short- and medium-run inflation dynamics and point to the limited influence of monetary policy in a period characterized by a flat slope of the Phillips curve. Finally, as I assess my outlook and future rate path between now and our next meeting, I remain mindful that financial market conditions have become increasingly accommodative even as the FOMC has raised the funds rate three times since December.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari.

Passage number 74.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with the “relatively soon” modification, and I, too, am comfortable with “For the time being.”  I was listening to President Rosengren say that he wanted the language to be even stronger.  I’m struggling with how you could make this even stronger.  I guess you could say “over the next seven weeks.”  [Laughter]  But I actually do think that, in light of the Chair’s testimony and the use of  “relatively soon” and “For the time being,” there will be no confusion in the markets that we mean September. Incoming data since the previous meeting continue to indicate that the economy is creating jobs at a rapid pace when we’re already past our full employment goal.  At the same time, we’ve received weak readings on inflation.  This tension is very likely transitory, and I expect that ongoing labor market tightness will bring us back to our inflation target over the medium term.  Assuming that conditions evolve as expected, I think it’s appropriate that we continue gradually removing accommodation by announcing our balance sheet normalization in September and an additional rate hike by year-end, by which I mean, I hope, this year’s end. A key issue in considering the appropriate pace of normalization of the funds rate is how one interprets the low readings of longer-term Treasury yields.  We discussed that quite a bit yesterday.  And, again, the Board staff’s memo, as others have mentioned, highlights a number of factors that may be holding down 10-year Treasury yields.  Now, I think it can be boiled down to two basic scenarios that I will be following closely.  The first is, our asset holdings are having a big effect—on the order of minus 90 basis points, according to the estimates presented in the Tealbook—on the term premium and thereby on 10-year yields.  In this scenario, the normalization of our balance sheet will gradually entail a tightening of financial conditions over the next few years.  However, in the second scenario, our balance sheet is no longer having a sizable effect on the 10-year term premium, and the low level of yields instead reflects a combination of a very low r* and, possibly, a persistently lower term premium due to other causes. One potential reason for a persistently low term premium in the period ahead is that longer-term inflation risks have shifted from being biased upward to being biased downward.   The high-inflation experience of the 1960s and 1970s previously caused investors to demand a large term premium.  In contrast, today longer-term risks to inflation may be weighted somewhat to the downside, reflecting the new realities of a globally low r* and the lower bound.  In this scenario, the term premium is likely to stay low even as we normalize the balance sheet. We can’t identify today which scenario is the right one.  We’ll have to wait until we move forward on balance sheet normalization.  Fortunately, though, our approach of gradually raising the funds rate over the next couple of years works well in either scenario.  In the first scenario, we want to go slow with rate hikes because we are reducing monetary stimulus along two dimensions at the same time.  In the second scenario, r* is lower than many—or, indeed, all—of us on the Committee currently believe, and the “go slow” approach makes sense because we have a shorter distance to travel to get back to normal.  Either way, I view the path embedded in the median projection as a reasonable and robust approach to policy, at least until we get greater clarity on how financial conditions evolve in response to the normalization of our balance sheet.  Thank you.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Williams, expresses his support for alternative B with a slight modification and agrees with the Chair's testimony. He also discusses the two different scenarios regarding the impact of the balance sheet normalization on Treasury yields, but he does not express disagreement or contention with any other person's views or opinions.


Passage number 75.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you.  I consider normalization of the federal funds rate to be well under way, the criterion for commencing balance sheet normalization.  Looking ahead, assuming the economy evolves as expected, I favor announcing the change to our reinvestment policy in September, with an implementation date that steers clear of any possible drama associated with the debt ceiling.  I like the clarity in the revised language in alternative B that makes clear we anticipate making the change to reinvestment policy “relatively soon,” conditional on the outlook.  And I have to say, I found President Mester’s arguments and  President George’s observations on the qualifier “For the time being” to resonate with my own, which is that it is redundant and possibly confusing. I view the federal funds rate as the preferred active tool because its effect on financial conditions and the economy is more extensively tested—and therefore more precisely understood—than changes to the balance sheet.  As a result, I think it’s appropriate to set in motion the change in the balance sheet policy.  And as long as the economy continues evolving broadly as expected, we would simply allow it to run off in the background at the gradual pace that was decided.  Then we would look to future adjustments in the federal funds rate as a means of calibrating the stance of monetary policy in response to ongoing changes in incoming data that may materially affect our outlook. Once that normalization process is under way, I’ll be looking closely at the evolution of inflation before making a determination about the path of the federal funds rate.  As we’ve all been discussing, we’ve been falling short of our inflation objective over a sustained period.  Standard monetary theory would suggest we shouldn’t return fully to the neutral rate of interest until we’re confident that inflation is on track to return to 2 percent.  What does that mean in practical terms.  The models that the staff monitors, which they present in the Tealbook, suggest that the short-run neutral rate is currently around zero in real terms.  If you add in a trailing core PCE inflation rate of about 1.4 percent, we’re really not very far from neutral currently.  So unless we expect inflation to move quickly back to target or there are indications the short-run neutral rate has moved up further or is going to move quickly, it appears we could be approaching neutral without too much additional work. Now, I talked yesterday about how I’ve been thinking about the likelihood inflation moves quickly back up to target.  Thinking the evolution of r* over the medium term, one  important consideration is the possible effects of balance sheet normalization.  If, indeed, balance sheet normalization will boost the level of the 10-year term premium by about 30 basis points between now and the end of 2019, a variety of estimates suggest that that would actually imply a decrease in the short-run neutral rate of interest.  And, depending on what foreign central banks do, that could either reinforce or offset that.  As President Williams said earlier, I’m not sure we know what’s going to happen as the balance sheet starts to run off. Of course, it’s possible other factors will be working to offset the downward pressure on the equilibrium funds rate.  That’s the case in the Tealbook forecast, with the result that it shows a path of r* that rises above its long-run value in the medium term.  My current hunch is that the short-run neutral rate of interest may not rise much over the medium term, but this is a very open question. With regard to the longer-run neutral rate, the downward revision in the Tealbook brings the estimate into line with my own forecast, taking into account the likely later and smaller fiscal stimulus than I had previously anticipated.  If the neutral rate remains low relative to its historical value, this puts a very high premium, as others have noted, on guiding inflation back up to target.  I’m sympathetic with the amendment suggested by President Bostic and echoed by others that perhaps we should be looking at the language in alternative A to signal that this is a real focus of the Committee. I’m also sympathetic to proposals that have been made around the table that maybe we should be looking more broadly—broadening the aperture—at proposals that might increase the pull of our target.  People have talked about nominal income targeting and price-level targeting.  Yesterday Governor Fischer talked about the possible merits of targeting a range instead of a point estimate.  I’m sympathetic to that, but I would worry that any range with a lower bound  below 2 percent would risk validating expectations the Committee is actually prepared to acquiesce in an underlying rate of inflation persistently below 2 percent. So, for today, I support alternative B.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And Vice Chairman.

Passage number 76.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If you were very unhappy about this, I think you need to seek counseling.  [Laughter]  This is just not a big deal, in my opinion. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So my proposal would be that we go with alternative B with both of the changes in blue. As far as the federal funds rate is concerned, I think it would be prudent to hold off on making further changes to the target range until we’ve seen more inflation data and have had a chance, as a number of you—almost all of you—indicated, to evaluate whether the recent soft readings on inflation are transitory or signal some more persistent soft trend.  I heard several of you support the inclusion in paragraph 3 of language that appeared in alternative A.  The inclusion of that language would ramp up somewhat our concern about inflation.  My suggestion  would be that we not make that change today.  But it is language we can certainly consider next time or any subsequent time, if we continue to be concerned about weak inflation data. I’m assuming that we will not be moving on the federal funds rate in September, when we make the change to our reinvestment policy.  But, obviously, we can make changes, depending on what we think the data warranted.  I think we have full flexibility on that.  My expectation is that we’ll wait until December, assuming the data come in more or less as expected.  But we retain flexibility on what to do about the funds rate, and we’ll need to carefully evaluate incoming inflation data.  So let me stop there and ask Brian to review what the FOMC will be voting on and read the roll.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a speech by Chair Yellen expressing her opinions and proposals, without any opposition or conflicting statements.


Passage number 77.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B as shown on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas Laubach’s briefing package, including both changes to paragraph 5 shown in blue.  The vote will also encompass the corresponding directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on pages 10 and 11 of that package. Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes President Evans   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President Harker   Yes President Kaplan   Yes President Kashkari   Yes Governor Powell   Yes  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Now we have two sets of related matters under the Board’s jurisdiction:  corresponding interest rates on reserves and discount rates.  I first need a motion from a Board member to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 1¼ percent.
