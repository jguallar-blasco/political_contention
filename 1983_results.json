That earnings squeeze that you expect for the banks, whichis only the tip of the iceberg now that we have money market depositaccounts and so forth, is going to force economization there. But ithasn't occurred importantly up to now. When you talk to bankers, byand large they're distressed by the rise in their operating expenseslast year but they haven't done much about it; they say they're goingto. I think that they will be forced to by events, so that mighthelp. In addition to the industrial area, we might have someproductivity improvement as a result of layoffs in finance also", "MR. PARTEE. I wondered if I might just ask a question aboutthe chart showing comparisons of postwar cycles on real GNP. As youcommented, Jerry, this is a distinctly less rapid recovery, by asubstantial factor, than the typical postwar recovery. You haven'tgone back to look at the staff projections of previous recoveries, butI wonder whether there isn't a tendency to understate the recoverythat actually occurs because of the obvious fact that there aredynamics in the situation that aren't foreseen at the time we startout on it. Do you have any idea", "MR. BLACK. Okay. Anyway. we projected about a 5 percentpickup in velocity and that led us to a greater increase in nominalGNP than the staff has been projecting", "MR. CORRIGAN. In terms of the real sector, the number that Ihave is 4-1/2 percent, as opposed to the staff's 3-1/2 percent, andit's hard for me to get too excited about those kinds of differences.But I'm inclined to the view that the inventory [liquidation] hasprobably run its course to a greater extent than the staff has [in itsforecast]. I also think there's at least a fair potential that thehousing sector will be stronger than the staff has projected as well.The area that I find a little more provocative in looking at the rangeof the forecasts is not so much the real numbers but the pricenumbers. I have a deflator number that's a little over 4 percent andI struggled a bit to get to that number. But I do agree with thesentiments that were expressed by several people earlier to the effectthat productivity will be stronger than the staff forecast. In my owncase, I ended up using a unit labor cost number of 2 percent on afourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis. Now, what's interesting abouta 2 percent unit labor cost number is that if you attack the GNP fromthe income side, and you assume unit labor costs are going up 2percent and you assume that unit interest and proprietors' income andall the rest do the same thing, a 5 percent rate of inflation permitssomething like a 40 percent increase in profit margin measures interms of the GNP accounts. That, together with the oil pricesituation and the food price situation, in the context of a 2 percent2/8-9/83rise in unit labor costs, leads me rather solidly to the view that wecan, in fact, do better than 4 percent on inflation. I think it'simportant to do it because if we found ourselves with the kind ofrecovery that's being talked about here and with prices rising at arate of 5-1/2 or 6 percent by the end of 1983, we'd have one heck of amess in 1984 irrespective of all the problems financing the deficit isgoing to cause in 1984. So, I am more optimistic on the price side.I think that's solid. But more importantly, if we don't get that kindof price performance in 1983, it bodes very poorly in my judgment for1984 and beyond", "MR. PARTEE. What you meant to say was that you didn't reallythink the profits would go up 40 percent", "MR. CORRIGAN. No, with 5 percent", " And if you make them, say, 30, that gives you--MR. CORRIGAN. Again, that assumes basically nothing specialabout oil prices. Even if you take the staff's estimate of an 8percent drop in oil prices, then in a sense it's a shoe-in. If we geta larger oil price drop, I don't know. That could get to be a problemtoo", "MR. ZEISEL. Yes", "MR. FORD. That tells us that industrial capacity is nowrunning at 67 percent or something like that. I had a number ofpeople, including the principal shareholder ofand a number of other major industrialistswho really look at this stuff, say to me that our index is reallypoor--not in the way we're doing the statistical work, but the meaningof it. The argument goes like this: If they really ran mills at 100percent of capacity in the way they think we measure it, they stillwouldn't make any money on some of their mills, especially those thatdon't have today's oil prices factored in. Any piece of equipment orany plant that's over 10 years old should not be counted as part ofcapacity is what they're saying. If one made this adjustment, theysay that the measured total against which we measure underutilizationof capacity would be lower and, therefore, we'd have a higher-than-recorded utilization rate. Related to that, one of the biggestcomponents of our industrial production figures that we report iselectricity production and other kinds of energy production, right. Idon't know how big a component it is, but the argument is that withthe huge jump in oil prices, even considering the recent modification,there's a trend factor toward conservation which is very stronglyreflected in things like energy per unit of output overall. If oneadjusted for this in thinking about industrial production, probablythe last 3 months instead of being down might actually be up, net ofthe conservation effect. Do any of these thoughts from businesspeoplemake sense to you, Mr. Zeisel, or Mr. Prell, or any of you", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Look, I think we're in a recovery. I justsay that one month of upturn does not a recovery make. And the mostrecent trend in automobile sales--I don't know that it means much, butit's down, not up. Automobile production is now up very close tosales. They have a lot of incentive programs going on. We know somesectors of the economy are declining and there are also plus factorsin the economy. We'll see", "MR. BALLES. The other question is, I guess, more analyticaland substantive: Is there a risk, not recognized perhaps in our Boardstaff, Bank staff, or [Committee] members' forecasts here, that wereally are sailing into uncharted seas with this huge proportion ofthe total pool of credit--the bulk of it--absorbed by the federalgovernment. I'd like to know your answer. My hunch, Mr. Chairman, isthat that supports your degree of skepticism about whether in fact therecovery is in the bag. There are two things that could upset thatrecovery: the depressing effects of interest rates that are stillpretty high both on a nominal and a real basis compared to historicallevels, and secondly what might happen when such tremendous shares ofcredit get soaked up by Uncle Sam in periods of economic expansion.I'm worried about the crowding out phenomenon. Is that something Ishould worry about", "MR. BOEHNE. But does fiscal stimulus mean the same thing ifit's financed through monetary policy. One of the reasons we havehigher real rates, I think, is the deficit. Whatever dollar you geton fiscal stimulus either results in some higher inflationaryexpectations or higher real rates", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I can interrupt. I think you'regetting a little ahead of this, John. All I'm interested in at this-23-2/8-9/83point are broad observations about the targets and how we deal withthem", "MR. MORRIS. Yes", "MR. MORRIS. I think we can influence them just as easily aswe can Ml. There's a mythology around this table that we have anextremely tight control over M1. I think it's a lot of nonsense", "MR. MORRIS. I don't believe that. I don't believe that", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I agree with a good deal--infact most--of what has already been said. Particularly, I agree withGovernor Wallich and the view that we ought to continue targeting theaggregates and should avoid explicit interest rate targeting for theessentially practical reasons that he set forth. I would like toemphasize, though, that we ought to keep in mind at all times what weconsider to be a desirable level of real interest rates and, while wedo not make these explicit, I think we ought to continue to look atinterest rates and keep in mind what range of rates we think would beconsistent with the results we would like to get. I especially agreewith Lyle that we ought to keep in mind that the main thing we have toachieve now is to get a recovery going and to try to nurture thatrecovery. Therefore, as we target aggregates I would favor settingtargets for Ml, M2, and M3, as well as domestic nonfinancial debt. Iwould want to remain very flexible in my view of which aggregate wasthe one to target on at any particular time. I would want to make itvery clear in our public statements and in the record that we feelfree to shift from one aggregate to another depending on itsusefulness. If we find that M3 is more useful than Ml or vice versa,we should feel free to make that shift in emphasis as we have in thepast. I would not at this point be prepared to throw Ml in the wastebasket. When things settle down six months from now, it may turn outto be a much more useful aggregate to target than it is today. So, Iwould emphasize two things: (1) we should maintain our flexibilityand our right to choose and shift the emphasis from one aggregate toanother from time to time; and (2) that we not take our eyes off ofinterest rates", " I'm not sosure we should hopscotch from one to the other, Emmett, but if we haveto we might--MR. RICE. Why not", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, my position probably will notsurprise many people, but you may see that I have an unusual degree offlexibility this time. I think we ought to continue to target theaggregates and I think we ought to include Ml in that for a couple ofreasons. For one thing, it has been less distorted. That may nothold over the long run; I don't know. We can address that if itdoesn't. I think it's important for our credibility that we put M1 inif at all possible, but I do think there's substance in the argumentsmade by those who say that it's going to be a little different kind ofbeast than we've had in the past. So, I would widen the range on theup side because it's probably going to contain a larger element ofsavings and also because it has grown so fast that I don't think wecan risk decelerating it that fast without jarring the economy andknocking off any recovery that may be developing. And if we shouldtry to use Ml, then I think that ought to be the main basis forconstructing our target paths because we found out M2 doesn't workvery well. We could, I suppose, use a target shadow reserverequirement, as Steve suggested in the memo last time, of 4 percent orsomething like that. But the truth of the matter is that even thoughwe've gone through the motions, we really have not been doing any kindof reserve targeting during this period. In fact I argued that wereally ought just to admit we were pegging the federal funds rate,which is what I think we've done and I think that was appropriateduring this period of uncertainty. But if we're going to get back toreserve targeting, it has to involve something that is to a largeextent reserveable", "MR. PARTEE. How do you answer Bob's point that we don't haveany reserve targeting at all. We just target on net borrowedreserves--that is, the funds rate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I had your name and I crossed it offwithout even hearing you, I guess", "MR. FORD. I was listening to you when you said that youwanted to get back to ask if there were any fundamentally differentthings that the Committee wanted to consider. In listening to whatwe've all said here, where we are headed--unless somebody does come upwith a different approach--is to [take a decision that would] add tothe noise in the marketplace. I want to be specific about what Imean. If you take all the things that have been mentioned here todayso far, and that a lot of people nodded their heads in favor of, whatthey come to is this: We haven't voted on it yet but I'd be willingto bet money that by the time we're done voting we will have agreedthat there are going to be more aggregates to look at. Specifically,we're going to add a credit variable or two. We're generally in favorof leaving Ml in, although with much less emphasis. There's strongacceptance of the reality that there is going to be more base driftthis time than ever before--and if I remember the numbers right--bothon M1 and M2. A number of people, at least Jerry, Ed, Lyle, Roger,and a number of others, have said \"Let's look through all this to thereal economy.\" That to me is another way of saying we're going to tryto impact the economy directly. And I don't think it's too much of astretch of the words to say we want to [fine] tune the economy inreality. We think we can do it. We've all used the word flexibility.Everyone who has spoken so far has used the word flexibility, which isanother way of saying wider bands and more allowance for moving thingsaround. And everyone is advocating the wider bands themselves.When I take all of these feelings that we've expressed, Mr.Chairman, it raises the question in my mind, in line with yourquestion: Why are we dealing with monetary aggregates at all. If yougo back to how we got there, the monetary theorists who pushed thiswhole concept had as one of the fundamental parts of the concept thatwe shouldn't try to fine-tune and especially shouldn't try on a short-term basis to be flexible about a lot of things. We should be lookingat some aggregate that hopefully has some relationship to what we'rereally trying to do over a long period of time and just let it go in asteady way and the market will know what we're going to do next. And2/8-9/83with these six or seven dimensions of flexibility that we're puttingon everything--. There are two or three people down this side of thetable who in different ways all stuck to it. Karen almost jumped onthe table and then backed off. Nancy said it. What we're doing is weare looking at the real economy, trying to manage it in real terms,and de facto we're using interest rates as the principal variable toattempt to do that. That's what we're doing.So, my answer to you would be: If we're going to do allthese other things, then it would be in the interest of not creatingmore noise in the markets just to say that we are now going to attemptin our collective wisdom to manage the real economy out of a recessionwithout managing it back into inflation and the principal thing we'regoing to do is move short-term rates. Because I think that's thetruth. Isn't that what we're really doing. It looks that way on thecharts to me. So, just in case somebody wants a fundamentalalternative--all the rest of the things all of you have said arevariations, I argue, on this theme of flexibility, more targets, andwider bands--I'll offer a basic alternative, if for nothing else butthe sake of discussion, which is to stop all that stuff and tellpeople that we're trying to set interest rates that will get us out ofthe recession and hope that it won't have side effects that will getus back into another round of inflation after it's over. That wouldbe in my view a more fundamental change and one that I don't want tosay I'm personally advocating 100 percent; but if the drift of theopinion around this table is to do all these other things, let's atleast consider that as an alternative", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you've put your finger on a pointthat I was going to make in summation. I would not carry it to thepoint that you carried it, but what I hear around the table--withmaybe your exception--is unanimity on targeting, which is where wewere before, and a lot of flexibility. I think those arefundamentally incompatible in a conceptual sense, if you push this farenough. In one theory of targeting, anyway, you'll go a long waytoward undermining what you are targeting if you're very flexible inhandling it. I detected a lot of nuances or differences, which givesus a job to reconcile. I wouldn't go all the way to targetinginterest rates very firmly because I think there are targets otherthan interest rates that we could adopt instead of monetary targeting.We can look at a lot of things in addition to interest rates, which Ithink is probably what we're doing. But I did want to note that Ithink the Committee is on two horses; I'm not saying wrongly. Butthere are two horses: One is targeting and one is flexibility. Andthey have two different names", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --is: Has not the velocity of old Ml beenmore consistent than that of new Ml", "MR. GRAMLEY. Just don't expect us to read it, Bob", "MR. BLACK. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In that connection, I would only pointout--and it surprised me a little--Mr. Axilrod's latest estimate. IfI read it correctly in the Bluebook, he is saying the estimate is nota good one in terms of being a reliable estimate. His estimate ispresumably the center of some range; I don't know whether he said thator not. If it is the middle of some range, what it says is that wehave no basis whatsoever for thinking that M2 was high in the last twomonths. In fact, it was a little on the low side. I don't thinkthat's the public appreciation. That hasn't particularly been myappreciation. I don't think that has been the appreciation anyplace,but that's what it says", "MR. FORD. Is that going to sell. Can we sell that", " I doubt it, but we--MR. GRAMLEY. I think we shouldn't try, Mr. Chairman", " Theidea of shift adjusting--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think it's a question that's fullysettled", "MR. MARTIN.

Well, I'm not sure about that, Nancy.We have such an overwhelming case on the distortion in M2 in terms ofthe numbers one can point to whereas we have a much more modest reasonfor shifting the base on Ml and M3. I think one could make anargument either way. My preference would be to show that we aremaintaining continuity where we can maintain it--where the distortionis not too great. So, I would have some preference for theasymmetrical treatment of the base, which I think just the sheermagnitude of the numbers would justify", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's getting late. Let me assert, andpeople can argue against this tomorrow if they want to, that forpurposes of putting in numbers in these blanks we will assume thatwe're going to do what Tony was just suggesting: We'll talk aboutfourth quarter-to-fourth quarter numbers for everything except M2where we will talk about some advance date as the base. Whether thatshould be February-March, I don't know. In saying that, we would haveto say that we assume that this [shifting] will slow down drastically.If it doesn't, we will have to look at the number again. So, whenwe're thinking about numbers, the staff's estimate--which is probablyno better than anybody else's--. Or maybe it is better. Let mereword that. It's probably better than anybody else's but thatdoesn't mean it's very good. But we may have to say something aboutit in the directive", " The staff has already assumed that just using aFebruary-March base for M2 until the end of the year we're stillgetting some upward bias by an order of magnitude of--MR. AXILROD. Well, we've assumed, given what's in that longfootnote, [the upward bias] to be about a point of growth", "MR. PARTEE. I'm not sure whether you addressed thisquestion, but I don't know that I agreed with the point that Steve wasmaking about cutting the range on M3 because there was no reason tothink that the institutions will want a larger market share. And,therefore, I think we ought to be careful about that", "MR. GRAMLEY. M1, yes. I think going back to that base ofthe fourth quarter for Ml is very, very risky. Now, I'm prepared todo that if we're prepared to put a zero weight on the target. To methat's a good compromise: 95 percent weight on M2, 5 percent on M3,and 0 on Ml", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but if we put it on this silly fourthquarter-to-fourth quarter basis that we do, we can't raise the targetsenough. We're always going to start above wherever it is.SPEAKER(.). At some point we can raise it enough", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. And for M1 on your alternative IIhere you're assuming a velocity of circulation very slightly negative", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All these fine velocity assumptions thathe made in the Bluebook rest upon a staff forecast that probably has alower nominal GNP than everybody else's forecast, or is at the bottomof the range, anyway, of everybody else's forecast", "[Meeting recessed]-44-2/8-9/83February 9, 1983--Morning SessionCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, ladies and gentlemen, afterlistening to our conversation yesterday, it seems to me that thistentative directive is probably a reasonable reflection of our concernto have targets but be flexible. So, I would suggest we assumesomething like this draft directive will be used. There will bechances for editorial comments, but let me just suggest in theinterest of focusing the discussion and expediting things that we putsome numbers in those blanks. And on page 3 of that directive I wouldtentatively suggest that we eliminate the alternative for M2 [thatmeasures the range from] the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter,just for purposes of the discussion at this stage anyway, and assumewe're going to [measure it] from February-March to the fourth quarter.If we take the middle course of what the staff says is consistent withtheir forecast--recognizing that very large amounts of uncertaintyexist about that and recognizing also that their forecast for nominalGNP is lower on average than other peoples' by 1 percent or somethinglike that--that says basically 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for that period,allowing for 1 percent or so of shifting from that base", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That could be rounded up to 7 to 10percent, I suppose, or rounded down to 6 to 9 percent, but we're inthat range. Turning to M3, for the fourth quarter-to-fourth quartercomparison the staff says 6 to 9 percent, period. That could bepushed; last year it was 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, so I think we're inthat range. Whether or not we want to include Ml in the same sentenceor make that a slightly more subsidiary sentence or tentative soundingsentence is an issue that we can return to. But the number that theyhave for M1 is 3 to 7 percent; that could be made slightly higher, Isuppose. So, we're around 3 to 7 percent or 4 to 8 percent, I think.And for total nonfinancial debt, which we really haven't discussedmuch, they propose this rather peculiar result in terms of past cyclesof 8 to 11 percent, which they'll have to justify at some point--alittle more than I think we've already discussed. It contemplates intheir forecast a further decline in credit velocity, which would beunusual during a period of recovery. But I take it they're preparedto defend that proposition. I just throw those out as a focus foryour discussion. Let's see what comments we get on them", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The second question I have is: If wewant flexibility, shouldn't we aim for a four-point spread in M2 thisyear instead of 3 points", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

Of course, we've never been any place close tothe lower end of the range in the last several years for M2. And toleave it at 6 percent when we have a new instrument seems funny to me", "MR. RICE. Yes, the tentative decision. I have some concernsabout the strategy and the relationship to the alternatives that weselect", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

I think7 percent is as much as we dare risk.

I don't understand what the purpose of it is", "MR. GRAMLEY. Yes. The midpoint is 9-1/2 percent and is alsoin my judgment very, very low. It leaves a ratio of private creditexpansion to GNP of 7-1/2 percent. There's only one number since 1961that was that low: 1975. So, we're talking about recession levels ofprivate credit expansion relative to GNP", "MR. FORD. But Lyle--Mr. Chairman, may I address this. Itseems to me one should think about the overall balance sheet. Nowwe're talking about the other side of the balance sheet than the onewe normally talk about. Isn't your argument tantamount in some senseto saying that there's a low saving rate in our economy, which we havein our forecast and which affects the flow of funds overall plus otherthings. You're suggesting we take it as a given--as something that weimplicitly accept--that there's going to be a huge bite of federalsector borrowing as projected in the nice charts we had yesterday,even with the cheery assumption that it's going through the roof rightnow but it immediately levels off for some reason. I still don'tunderstand the chart from yesterday's presentation. Another way ofsaying what you're saying is that if we choose these numbers we'retalking about now, we're not leaving room for the private sector.Doesn't that translate into saying \"Let's monetize the federal debt\"", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All right. You're looking at private. Ifyou look at the total, this number is high relative to the 1960s and alittle low relative to the 1970s", "MS. TEETERS. Lyle, may I ask what you did.

Then just make it \"and for the period from the fourthquarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, M3, which appears to beless distorted by the new accounts....\" And then say something like\"A tentative range of 4 to 8 percent\"--if that's what we have--\"hasbeen established for M1 assuming Super NOW accounts are not vigorouslypursued and that the [proposal before the DIDC for] business demanddeposits isn't adopted", "MS. HORN. You'd like me to wait until discussion of that", "-68-2/8-9/83MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, that language about the SuperNOWs--if it says we assume nothing happens on that--may compromiseyour position at the moment with the DIDC. Does it bother you at all", "MR. GRAMLEY. But you used the wording that this range makesno allowance for any marketing of Super NOWs for businesses", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

I justthink it's better this way if it has a little less emphasis preciselybecause it does have less emphasis", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just to put a little balance on thisdiscussion in that direction, my concern about that sentence on thetop of page 4 was that it was too strong. I'd ease it slightly andsay \"While the behavior of M1 will be monitored, the weight placed onthat aggregate over time will be dependent on evidence", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would argue that appropriate growth,which is obviously relevant here, is covered in this other sentencethat says we're going to look at that again anyway.

I just don't know.I guess we're saying the opposite", "MR. BOEHNE. I think, though, that my approach does give acoloration to it that the Committee is keeping open the whole issue ofthe weight that it's going to give to Ml.

My wording pushesthat decision into the future, should that evidence exist", "2/8-9/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think the issue is whether\"closely\" is in there.

And here we are saying we are nottargeting it directly", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There are several points. The growth inM1 in the last quarter of last year has been revised substantiallydown.

Your first sentence was \"[existing degree of]reserve restraint expecting that this will..", "MR. ROBERTS. Is that soft relative to those earlier targets", "MR. GUFFEY. Well, I'm not sure I understand what you've doneto this language. If we retain the language consistent with thecurrent degree of restraint, that suggests that there isn't anyflexibility for easing and achieving a discount rate decrease, for-83-2/8-9/83example, because we would provide reserves in such a way as tomaintain the current interest rate levels unless we saw the aggregatescoming in much, much slower or at least slower than now. That seemsto me in the period ahead to be somewhat unlikely to any appreciableextent.

PARTEE. I would want to communicate my position as notagreeing with that", " And I'd maybe not putany language in that suggests that we'll continue this restraint until2/8-9/83we see the aggregates growing at some lower rate, because that alsowould--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, yes, I think you're forced to that.Just to be clear: I'm not arguing for or against it at this point. Ithink you have to put in some language that says we would seek toreduce--or I suppose you could live with this language if the discountrate is reduced, which isn't your decision", "MR. WALLICH. I think it would take a real collapse of thegrowth rate of the aggregates to justify reducing interest rates underpresent conditions. That could happen; we shouldn't preclude it. Butif the aggregates remain half-way strong and the economy expandsmoderately, I don't think that's the time to reduce interest rates", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The only thing I disagree with hereis that I think we can't make too sharp a break. If we get tooexplicit in disregarding the monetary aggregates, I think it's goingto cause adverse market reactions", "MR. ROBERTS. I think that's just dead wrong, Mr. Chairman,because if we just control interest rates without consideration of theaggregates, the markets will take over in terms of expectations--Ithink it's already happening in the long market--and raise interestrates and that will be self-defeating and abort the recovery. We'dget exactly the reverse of what we want. The Board could lower thediscount rate to zero, but if it has nothing to do with market rates,it doesn't mean anything", "MR. FORD. Well, I disagree with that. But I think you'reright that the consensus is there. I thought you were asking \"Is thatthe consensus.\" And I think it is. But I personally disagree with itbecause I think we face the possibility of a very vigorous [economy].Suppose these events continue and all these things--the real thingsthat we lack such as housing starts and auto sales--start to take offcoupled with all the aggregates, however defined, continuing to growat scary rates. Then what would you do", "MR. FORD. That's quite a critical period. At the risk ofembarrassing John, who may want to refute what I'm going to say, hewas just showing me some research that he likes, which seems toindicate that the traditional problem the Fed has faced in the past isoverstaying ease because we're always talking about what is happeningin the economy today when the decisions we're making will impact witha lag--in the summer, the fall, and the end of the year. So, I don'tagree with the consensus, but I think you correctly identified it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Now, if we have a sentence of thatsort, a question still remains in that it says nothing about anyeasing at all under any contingencies. The second sentence Isuggested says we might do that if the aggregates are slow enough. Wehave had some expression of opinion that we ought to be doing thatanyway", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's true also of these otherformulations with liquidity or the weakness in the economy, etc. Ifthere is a consensus for that, all I'm saying is that it ought to beworded more generally. I don't like the phrase \"weakness in theeconomy", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just ask the voting members at thispoint, and I won't try to pin down the exact wording: Who wants to gobeyond what we've just tentatively agreed to--that if the aggregatesare weak enough we ease--and add another phrase referring to theeconomy or liquidity or something. Five. How many clearly do notwant to add any other phrase. Just to make sure, we'll see how manymugwumps there are on that side. Five. Five to five and one personwho didn't express an opinion apart from myself", "MR. PARTEE.

I appreciate the difficulties of putting in anynumbers at all given the prevailing uncertainties.

Further movement in that direction could well have asignificant effect on attitudes; it depends on the degree, I think.It's one of those extremely difficult questions to answer becausebusiness attitudes are likely to be very sensitive at this time", "MR. BOEHNE. Well, just an observation on that: Thereclearly is a recovery and attitudes are clearly improved, but it'smore because people have seen business go downhill or be completelystalled for so long that even a modest lift from the very deep holethat they're in makes them feel a good bit better.

Well, I'm not sure I'm going to respond to that;I don't want to make a markedly different case. I just would like toobserve perhaps the obvious that has already been touched on. What wehave seen and have described as a recovery is largely driven by thetwo interest-sensitive sectors of our economy, autos and housing. Andto the extent that interest rates move up appreciably from this level,that quite likely could kill off the recovery. In other words, therecovery that's being projected is very fragile. I just note that oneof the comments made concerning the outlook was that [the staff]expects business spending on equipment and exports to increase tosustain this recovery, and each of those areas is as fragile or asuncertain as anything we can tie it to. I really think this is a veryfragile recovery. There's no question of recovery, but [in] autos andhousing it's the rundown of inventories that has made the numbers lookpretty good in the last 2 months or perhaps 3 months. That can goaway pretty quickly with any increase in rates--maybe even to thelevels that we're now experiencing. The reported increase in the fedfunds rate, for example, and the upward pressure that may exert--theprime could go up--could be very devastating in my view to thisrecovery", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I think it's a little too early tohave any convictions as to how strong this expansion is going to be.We have two sets of numbers, January and February. The Januarynumbers at face value looked very good, but probably the seasonalfactors made them look better than they were. The February numbers ingeneral were quite disappointing. If we're talking about triggeringorder books, they weren't triggered in February; the orders numbers in3/28-29/83February were really quite disappointing. Again, that may reflect thefact that the January numbers were inflated. But certainly, the rangeof numbers for February on retail sales, on personal income, and onnew orders would have to be viewed as on the disappointing side. Ithink we need another month of data to shake this out; I'd like to seea little more of that inadequate inventory phenomenon showing throughin the orders. It's not there yet", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One aspect that Governor Martin did notmention, except by implication, is that unfortunately the savings andloans have gotten themselves more and more sensitive to changes ininterest rates on the liability side of the balance sheet and they areeven less in a position to take an increase in interest rates now thanthey were before", "MR. BOYKIN. Oh, yes", "MR. FORD. We will pay when all this borrowing in the privatesector that has to come in order to continue the expansion much beyonda few months comes into conflict with government [borrowing].

Because private credit demands arecolliding with government credit demands", " So, all in all--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now he can convince a few other people ofthat", "MR. PARTEE. I don't think we should say we're going to stoptargeting these things. On the other hand, I don't agree with Henrythat we ought to run our policy on the basis of a presumed pathrelative to targets. I think we ought to continue to do about whatwe've been doing because I don't think, Henry, that we should changeback to proximate targeting on the aggregates when we still have thisinexplicable decline in velocity. It seems to me that as soon as wecan see something in terms of a move to a more normative relationship,then we ought to return strictly to monetary targeting, but not now.We have no more reason now than we had last time or in the fourth3/28-29/83quarter, since we're still getting sizable declines in velocity by allevidence", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It might be. I don't say you're wrong; Ijust don't know how to find it directly. That kind of explanationsounds more plausible to me than Mr. Corrigan's, but the other thingis that it seems to be happening all over the country. You read thatFederal Reserve notes in all the Federal Reserve Banks are going up.It's a strange phenomenon and I don't know how to approach findingmore information. Just in line with Mr. Corrigan's earlier comments,I think it's worth scratching our heads harder and expending someresources in trying to work on what's going on in Ml in general interms of behavior patterns, particularly Super NOWs", "MS. TEETERS. Yes, they are all banks. We're going toincrease the strains in the economy by increasing interest rates.And, if anything, I think we ought to be aiming to lower them. Infact, I am very much against this. If snugging went on--however thatterm got into the public press--I am opposed to it. I think therates, if anything, should have been drifting lower and not higherover the intermeeting period. And [the funds rate] certainly shouldnot have been above the discount rate. I also am cautious. I wantmore information. We're running on highly seasonally adjusted numbersat this point and sometimes [the final numbers] don't turn out thatway. I think we do have a backlog in housing and we're probablycatching up on it. But we could destroy any recovery in housing ifthe mortgage rate goes up above 13 percent again. So, I would be withEmmett. I would like to see the [funds] rate come back down to atleast 8-1/2 percent and, if anything, fluctuate between 8 and 8-1/2percent rather than between 8-1/2 and 9 percent. The real interestrate is extraordinarily high. And I don't think that we can get asustained recovery, particularly with the high interest rates thatwe're dealing with at the present time. On the other hand, I realizethat there is still a booming federal deficit out there. And I thinkthere is some movement in Congress to do something about it. But if-52-3/28-29/83we give up too soon, they won't do it. So, I would like to wait formore information. I certainly am opposed to any increase in rates andwould like to see them return to where they were at the time of thelast meeting. I would go for \"A\" or \"B\" and I don't think thelanguage makes a lot of difference. If I had to be pushed one way orthe other, I'd go for alternative I, but I don't think that's whatwe're operating on, frankly", "MR. KEEHN. I certainly am in agreement that the recovery isin place but I tend to be much more on the cautious side than otherpeople as to just how strong a literal recovery we have. It seems tome that so far the growth has been entirely on the interest sensitiveside of the economy and so far it has been uneven. The capital goodssector continues to be very weak and, therefore, at this point I thinkwe just couldn't run the risk of having rates go up significantly. Bythat I mean that I think the upper end of the fed funds range inalternative C would be unacceptably high. I think we can continue tosustain the recovery if we have fed funds broadly in the area of wherethey are now, in the 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent area or something likethat. On the other side, I do think there's an awful lot of noise,and I'm suitably confused by the level of noise in the aggregatenumbers. But there is rather compelling evidence that we have beenthrough a period of pretty rapid expansion and I think we have tobegin to set the stage to react to that at some point lest we let itget out of control. So, I think we ought to become a little moredirected in our language as to what we're going to do. I would be infavor of alternative II. Having said that, though, with regard to thedirective under alternative II, I'd leave in both parentheticalexpressions. I would be in favor of [the specifications of]alternative B, but I would tend to let the initial borrowing level goup to, say, $300 million, or broadly about where it is now. Thatseems to me to be an acceptable course given the circumstances", "MR. MORRIS. Well, so much for Ml. I'm still uncomfortablewith having an M2 target at this juncture because the second-quartertargets here are based on assumptions as to how rapidly the adjustmentto the money market demand account is going to be completed. Theassumption may be good or it may not be good. It seems to me that inthis period of transition the case for having an M2 target is not verystrong any more. It seems to me we'd be better off with simply an M3target, as Tony has suggested I think. Until we get some furtherevidence to tell us how strong the expansion is going to be--and weshould get that in the next couple of weeks when we get Marchemployment numbers, which ought to be a pretty good indicator--itseems reasonable to hold to the present level of interest rates. ButI would agree with Nancy in the sense that I would urge the Manager,when he has to make a choice, to err on the side of a little moreease. Lately we seem to have be erring on the side of a little morerestraint, which I don't think is particularly appropriate at thisjuncture. I would keep the existing directive language.

It might not get below 8-1/2 percent, but I would think it'dbe more likely to be edging to an 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent range orsomewhere in there.

So, our technical questionto the staff, Jerry, is: Which of these different indicators of pricemovements do you consider to be the more meaningful", "MR. BLACK. Jerry, if you exclude the CCC payments from thefourth quarter and also from the first quarter so that you get finaldemand of roughly the same magnitude in both quarters and make someallowance for the point that John Balles made about the possibleoverstatement of that implicit price deflator, wouldn't it look a gooddeal stronger. It would look somewhat stronger than average if itlooked about average before you made those adjustments, wouldn't it", "5/24/83MR. BLACK. But if in fact the point that John raised hassome validity, as we're inclined to think it does, and you made thoseadjustments, I would think real final sales may well be higher in thefirst quarter than they were in the fourth quarter", "MR. TRUMAN. I'd say right up front, Mr. Guffey, that thereis clearly room for some skepticism about that element of theforecast. We are forecasting for the year a current account deficitof $35 billion, which would be more than twice the rate we've ever hadbefore, and by the end of the year a current account deficit of $60billion, which would be four times the [highest] annual rate we'veever had before. And our sense is that the market will look atnumbers of that sort, which will start coming out in the latter partof the year, with trade deficits of over $70 billion per month at anannual rate, and say that that will be unsustainable and that therewill have to be some corrections. We do not predicate this on much,by the way, in terms of trade in the United States falling relative toabroad or otherwise. One can argue that these kinds of forecasts,while they are high relative to market forecasts and to conventionalforecasts, are not out of the range of what people talk about. TheAdministration has relatively similar forecasts and they have more orless made them public. Our sense in talking to people in the market,although they know that some economists are forecasting these numbers,is that they're not going to react to them until they in some sensesee them. And as Sam noted in his report, the fact that the currentaccount moved back not toward zero but something like $7 billion at anannual rate from something over $20 billion in the second half of1982, largely because of oil which in many respects is a spuriousfactor, is one reason why the dollar at least in the short run hasstayed quite strong. That factor has, if anything, moved in the otherdirection in the short run. I would make one other comment. Much ofthe change in net exports in the second quarter is the resumption ofoil imports and, in fact, the two surprising things about the firstquarter were the decline in oil imports, which we obviously did notfully anticipate, and the remarkable growth in non-oil imports. Ifyou look at those numbers, which are really big numbers--and [sparked]by oil, which dropped to $20 billion at an annual rate--if anything,the outlook that we have now is more pessimistic for the currentaccount than it was two months ago", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My question has been taken care of byRoger. I just have a lot of skepticism about that projected declinein the dollar, if one assumes interest rates stay in this range, giventhe enormous interests on the part of foreigners in our securitiesmarkets and less confidence in European securities. A lot of theEuropean bankers we spoke with talked in terms of a very highpercentage of their portfolios staying in U.S. securities. Combinedwith the interest rate spread outlook and the safety haven aspects, wemay very well see next year the same kind of disappointment withregard to the dollar value that we expected in the last year. Thebulk of the market had expected a decline in the dollar in the last 12months and it didn't materialize. Nobody can say for certain; it'sjust that I personally have some skepticism that we should count onany decline with any degree of certainty", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Not very much, because central bankshave not been adding to their holdings. And [private] foreignersdon't tend to hold a very large portion of U.S. Treasuries", "MR. KEEHN. On the domestic side I can confirm that the goodnews is even arriving in the Middle West but with one caution. Thecapital goods side is still exceptionally weak. The people I talk to-8-5/24/83who are in the very heavy side of capital goods see no improvement nowand they really are very discouraged about the outlook, particularlywith low operating ratios. Some of the people who have never reallybeen concerned about exports before--never relied on those markets--see this as an opportunity. And because of the exchange rate, theyfeel that they are precluded from any relief on that side. So, thepeople in heavy capital goods are still pretty discouraged about theoutlook. But other than that, I think the general environment in theMiddle West is significantly better than the last time we met", "MR. WALLICH. Well, I interpret this as a getting into the 5,6, 7 percent range at some point and I would think that would beexcessive. Now, what I wanted to ask is: The Redbook contains aspecial exercise on the construction industry. To me it showed theenormous diversity of conditions and how much of an artificial number,essentially, the average of all these different local conditions is.I was wondering whether it had been of any use to the staff", "MR. MARTIN. This discussion is so different from ourprevious one. It certainly is gratifying to hear what I think is awell founded positive outlook. I won't call it optimism because ithas some aspects to it that I don't think apply. So, let me be Dr.Doom here for a minute and remind everyone that Wachovia has raisedits prime rate, that Bankers Trust has raised its broker loan rate,and that while one must allow for a good deal of difficulty theTreasury is experiencing because of Congressional inaction--if that'sthe correct term--on the debt ceiling, nevertheless, over the last fewdays there has been some upward pressure in the markets. Maybe thisis very transitory as far as interest rates are concerned. But if welook at the LDC debt question vis-a-vis these firming rates and assumeanything like even a 75 or 80 or 90 basis point increase in thatburden, we are looking at countries with $90 billion or $84 billion or-12-5/24/83$40 billion or whatever projections you'd like to use by the end of1983. If we consider how much of that debt is nonsovereign debt butis private debt, how much of it is carried by our banks and how muchis carried on a variable rate basis, [we see the impact] of the driftin rates on additional funds being advanced in those giant workoutsituations.If we consider the vulnerability of those countries who areoil exporters--to shift my ground here a little--if prices decline onthe petroleum products substantially more, these countries are payingon a weighted average basis higher interest rates. Yes, thatcertainly is offset to some degree by our ability to absorb someimports in some cases. The IMF constraints, as the Chairman andothers commented earlier in this meeting, [impose] great difficultieson some of the countries--even those who are taking them seriously andattempting to comply. And then, of course, finally there are thepolitical implications of compliance and the political implications ofhigher rates on the variable portion of the debt. It comes out to bequite cumulative. So, while I share the positive outlook with regardto our own economy--I have some reservations still in the housing areabut share generally the outlook--I think we must inject into ourdiscussions here, and we already have, the extreme complications andextreme sensitivities and vulnerabilities on the international side", "MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, with regard to the near term,I'm inclined to the view that we'll probably do better than the staffforecast in terms of real growth and maybe even in terms of inflation.But I'm not nearly as sanguine about 1984, certainly. I think forsome of the reasons Mr. Martin and Mr. Solomon suggested on theinternational front, we're by no means out of the woods there. But inaddition to that, I must say in looking at the budget process and thebody language that it is associated with, it doesn't seem to me that-13-5/24/83any real progress has been made on the so-called structural deficit--maybe some, but certainly nothing to write home about. But on top ofthat I do think we have to recognize that there is a lot of pent uppressure out there to raise prices. I think we're going to be able toavoid a manifestation of that pressure, perhaps for a period of time,simply because the productivity/unit labor cost phenomenon is workingalmost perfectly right now. That's not going to last forever. So, asI say, the near term looks fine, but I'm just not sure about 1984.And, looking at the staff's implied forecast, it gets a little hardfor me to imagine out in 1984 how we really can keep those interestrates where they have them with underlying conditions what they are", "MR. ROBERTS. I think I'll wait for the monetary discussion.I want to respond to Tony. I disagree with him about 100 percent", "MR. BALLES. One more question, Mr. Chairman. I certainlyshare the feeling around the table here that the business outlook isclearly better this time than at the time of the last meeting. It'scertainly true in the West. I'm getting a little concerned, though,about the inflation outlook and whether it will be as favorable as thestaff forecast has it. I'd like to turn to you again, Jerry, on thatone. Our staff is not as optimistic as your people are. I hopeyou're right. I understand that your forecast for the deflator as weget out into the balance of this year is dependent on some improvementin productivity which seems to be fairly significant--about 3 percentgrowth, if I remember the figures correctly", "MR. FORD. So, I'm as concerned about the condition of someof our banks as the rest of you are concerned about the condition ofthe international banks. I'm not sure [about the latter]. In themacro picture I come out where Jerry does. The next few quarters lookpretty good to me. The big question is the one we were raising aboutwhether the staff will be right. I've never wanted to pray harderthat they're right. But I must say I share some of the skepticismthat has been voiced about whether we can continue to keep inflationdown as well as they say we will. I hope they're right, but thatforecast is hard to visualize against the monetary and fiscal backdropthat we have right now.May I ask one question. Someone was talking about countingon a $30 billion tax boost. Where is this fiscal [legislation]. Isthat tax reduction in the bag now or is somebody talking about tryingto recapture some of it", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I don't have any additional insightsto put on the table. I just want to say that I come out very much inthe middle of this discussion that we've had so far. I'm impressedwith the vitality that the economy has shown recently. And if thingsgo the way they should go, I would expect that the expansion willcontinue at a healthy clip for the reasons pointed out by Chuck andLyle and others around the table. It seems to me that that's the bestbet for the present time. But I think that we ought to be prepared tobe disappointed. The consumer it seems to me has every reason to beexpanding his expenditures, but the consumption sector may not performthe way we would expect at the present time. We've been disappointedby the consumer before--surprised on both the up side and the downside, as a matter of fact. And I think we should remember that theconsumer did not respond to last summer's tax cut the way we expected.Also, while I agree that it's too early to expect a big boom in thecapital goods sector, the outlook for the capital goods sector isworrisome to me. I recognize that the most recent figures for capitalequipment spending have been very encouraging, stronger than anybodyexpected. But we haven't seen any indication that capitalexpenditures for heavy equipment and so forth are going to perk up,and I'm just not convinced that they will. Also, we have to keep inmind the possibility that the dollar will not decline and that exportswill not expand--the scenario emphasized by Roger and Pres and Tony.So, in short, I think we have to be prepared for the downside outcome.But I have to say that I come out in the middle and, therefore, Iwould tend to go along pretty much with the staff's forecast", "MR. BALLES. I don't really disagree with what has just beensaid, Paul, but I am a little concerned--and I'd like to hear yourview--about what the market's reaction is going to be if we in factcome in this month with a 24 percent increase in Ml, as the Bluebooksuggests. We're going to have a hard time convincing markets thatwe're not off to the races and an overexpansion of money. I think,Paul, that we will have to do something more than just sit", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One of the really curious things aboutthis to me is why currency is going up around the world. That onelittle component has had a very strange experience here and [abroad]", "MR. ROBERTS. We can't change it at this point. Yes", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, you may not find itsurprising that Mr. Roberts and I differ rather dramatically", "MR. MORRIS. I think the staff paper on the behavior of M1was very good in that it pointed out that not only is the velocity of-22-5/24/83M1 not currently predictable but we have no basis for assuming that itwill be predictable in the foreseeable future, because we have had achanged concept--one which blends transactions balances with savingsbalances in unknown proportions. And I think our current posture oftelling the market that we are not targeting Ml but are watching it iscreating instability in the marketplace, which is counterproductive toour objectives. I think we have seen responses in the marketplace toM1 numbers which, while they are not of the magnitude of earlieryears, are certainly not very productive. And it seems to me that thetime has come to tell the market that, at least for the foreseeablefuture, we don't have any basis for confidence that we can predict thevelocity of M1 and, therefore, we are abandoning Ml and are not goingto watch it. We will publish it weekly for historical interest only.It seems to me that the time is right. I thought it was right inFebruary to get rid of Ml but it seems to me that the evidence sinceFebruary should lend some weight to my case that we ought to startmoving away from consideration of Ml as a target or as something thatwe watch--whatever that means", "MR. WALLICH. I think we have to distinguish between givingdifferent weights to the different aggregates and watching them. Ifwe give different weights, we say that each of them is potentiallymisleading. So we give more weight at the present time to M2 and M3,put a little weight on Ml and, therefore, are saying that we are notgoing to trust M2 and M3 and the debt variable fully either. They areall slightly wrong and the most likely right number seems to liesomewhere in the weighted average. This doesn't seem to me a verylogical procedure when you have specific reasons to distrust one ofthe aggregates such as we have, I think, to distrust Ml. There arereasons why people will hold more of their money [in Ml], whether indemand deposits and currency or even in NOW accounts, than they wouldat much higher rates of interest and higher rates of inflation. And Iwould be willing, while watching Ml and not ignoring it, neverthelessnot to give it any weight", "-23-5/24/83MR. WALLICH. No. I think the time may come when theargument that now leads to ignoring Ml loses some of its strength; andthen if Ml still continues strong, one would have to say one had madea mistake and that there was something to it. But at the present timeI think that the more reasonable argument is that there is somethingamiss with Ml and that therefore, while watching it, one is not actingon its signals. The strongest reason for proceeding that way, itseems to me, is the high level of real interest rates. If Ml wereeffective in the usual way of generating expansion, it would be bydriving down interest rates. It hasn't done so. So I conclude thatthe usual transmission mechanism from Ml to aggregate demand somehowis not operative at this time. There is a further very minor point tobe made on that same side. The divisia aggregates, which computemoney on the basis of the moneyness of the aggregates rather than justadding up demand deposits and savings deposits and calling it allmoney, in the last few months universally seem to have shown a lowerrate of growth than the unadjusted regular aggregates. I have noparticular faith in this technique, but it is an interesting device inthat, since it seems to support what I think reasonable for otherreasons, it is something worth factoring into this", "MS. TEETERS. I would tend to go along with $250 million inborrowings, which presumably would keep the interest rate where it is.I have many of the [worries] that have been expressed, particularly inthe international scene. And I don't think we can get a sustainedrecovery with 8-1/2 percent rates of interest and 10-1/2 per cent inlong-term rates. I think rates should be lowered in order to sustainthe recovery; I can stay where we are at least until July, but mypresumption is that sometime over the next several months we are goingto have to lower the rates in order to keep the economy going. Theother thing that I think is probably going to happen is that with thereduction in the first-quarter GNP we are going to have a quarter--probably the second or third, as Chuck said--in which the inventorieswill go in the other direction, and we could get a very strong one-quarter [expansion]. If that happens, I hope that we won't panic andthen raise the rates in order to offset something which is a perfectlynatural development. If anything, I would like to see the borrowingsaround $200 million rather than $250 million", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I would keep the borrowing level at$250 million, for what it is worth. It isn't worth very much,obviously. I would use the M2 and M3 targets under alternative A; infact, if I had my druthers, I would round them on the up side and makethem 8 and 7 percent. We have a strange situation where we arerunning short of our March-to-June targets by about 2 points and wehave not been offered an alternative that comes closer to returning tothe original targets. For March to June we had put M2 and M3 at 9 and8 percent, [respectively]", "MR. BOEHNE. I think we are getting ahead of ourselves on thecase for snugging up. It just seems to me that that is entirely toopremature. The only real argument for doing it is what we are seeingfor Ml and that does seem to me an awfully thin reed on which to basesnugging up. Our sentiments have changed about the economy. It doeslook better than six weeks ago, but there is considerable room for itto look better without our worrying that we have a boom. We stillhave lots of unused capacity even if one allows for all the structuralproblems; we are still in the very early phases of the recovery. Itis broader-based, but I don't see any evidence that it is running awayfrom us in any way that is going to prove to be a problem. Add tothat the international situation, which I think if anything argues forlower rates. Even though there may be a case down the road where wewould have to raise rates for domestic reasons, it seems to me that wewould want to be pressed to do that rather than anticipate it. If welook at the various measures of monetary policy that we have--realinterest rates, M2, M3, and credit--and add all those up, everythingis on the side it seems to me for at least staying where we are. Theonly thing that is on the other side, for snugging up, is Ml and thatjust isn't much to base it on. So, I come down for staying where weare. Operationally, I would keep borrowings at about $250 million; Iwould carry forward in about the way that we have been conductingpolicy in the last several weeks", "MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, I started out where a lot ofpeople are. Internationally, the case is overwhelming that we wouldbe better off with lower interest rates and a lower exchange rate.But looking at this domestically, I must say that I do get some sensethat there may well be a case for some snugging up or whatever youwant to call it. I would lean in that direction not because of M1 asmuch as I would because of the economy. I do think that the risks areon the side of the economy being stronger rather than weaker than thestaff's forecast. And I am very much inclined to the view that a moremoderate and balanced recovery right now works in the direction ofmaking that recovery more durable and more sustainable, partly becauseI do think it works in the direction of minimizing the risks that someof those pent up pressures on prices, that I at least sense are there,could be unleashed. In some very practical ways the question that weface right now is: If we do snug up a bit, does that assist in[achieving] our longer-range objectives for the economy. In part Itry to answer that by asking myself the question: What will happen tobond rates if we do snug up a little, recognizing that they havealready increased 50 basis points in the last two weeks. On the otherhand, what would happen to bond rates if we didn't do anything. Insome ways I think that is the $64 question. My instinct is that inthe current circumstances a gentle move in the direction of snuggingmight well produce the result of helping to stabilize long-term-27-5/24/83interest rates; and we have had experience in the past to suggest thatsome increase in short-term interest rates early on in a businessrecovery can be reversed. I think that happened in the mid-1970s in away that did not inhibit the early phases of recovery. So, I wouldcome out in the direction of, say, putting borrowings around $400million in the expectation that the federal funds rate might move uptoward the 9 percent range--again, not because I'm paranoid about Mlbut because of the way I'm looking at the economy and the way thatover time I think that might help us rather than hurt us in terms ofour long-term objectives for the economy", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I deliberately waited until BobBoykin had spoken before I made a statement, because not very long agohe made a glowing compliment about my statement by saying he wouldhave agreed with it all until he heard you speak. And that sort ofwiped me out, so I thought I would wait this time. I suppose it won'tcome as a real surprise to anyone that I think we ought to continue togive greater emphasis to Ml. One of the reasons we abandoned Ml isthat we felt MMDAs and Super NOW accounts would affect Ml; I thinkthat was proper. But the growth rate has fallen off pretty sharply inrecent weeks and the original reason for shifting away from Ml to M2seems to me to have largely dissipated. There remains the argumentthat the demand for Ml balances may have increased because the OCDsintroduced an element of elasticity in the demand and also an elementof savings. I think there is some substance to that, but we are notreally going to know the answer to that for many, many months down theroad. And there's a risk that it might not have changed thatsignificantly. In view of that, I think we have to weigh the risks indeciding what policy ought to do. To me there is some risk that if wedo not move somewhat now, we may have some unwinding of this goodeffect we have had on inflation. And I would be particularlyconcerned about the adverse effect on long-term debt markets. So, Iwould favor going back to the old procedure, of course, where weadjusted our borrowing target automatically as Ml varied off thetarget. But I know we are not going to get that. I would next fallback to \"C,\" which I also know we are not going to get. So, if I werevoting, I guess you all would probably push me up to maybe \"B minus.\"But I definitely think we ought to make some move now", "-30-5/24/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we obviously have a difference ofopinion, but for the most part the difference of opinion is notnumerically huge. I am impressed, domestically, by the actual andpotential strength [of the economy]. It's moving pretty fast now,with inventory still negative in the last figures; I don't knowwhether they were negative in April or May, but we've had a lot ofinventory liquidation and some increase in final demand. We'll get ashift in inventories at some point and consumers are very confident,if one believes these surveys at all. Ordinarily, I don't give themmuch weight, but they surely are going through the roof right now witha tax cut of some size coming up in thirty-six or thirty-seven days.The conflict is quite clear in all the comments people havemade. I don't think there's much question about the short-termoutlook, which I take to be six months or so, for the economy.There's a question of its sustainability or certainly its balance.There are questions about investments and questions about exports,which are very real. And I think that's partly a reflection of thebudgetary problem. We have a straight-out conflict between thedomestic and international considerations. I don't know that we couldhave much more of a pronounced conflict there. That is clearly fed bythe budgetary situation. We cannot control the budgetary situation;therefore, we have no satisfactory policy by monetary policy alone.We have problems in the credit structure that have been mentioned andwould be eased by easier money, but that also creates a conflict. Iam left with no answer in monetary policy except a compromise in anunsatisfactory situation. I am not so bothered by this Ml; whether wecount it or not, I think we weigh it a little--more than a little. Idon't ignore it myself; I don't know that I'm pulled by it. But whenthe movement gets large enough, I don't see how we can totally ignoreit. It lends a little weight to whatever decision we make.I come out on the side of a little snugging up, which weshould be prepared to reverse if things come out satisfactorily interms of the aggregates or if there are any real signs that it isintolerably--that is a strong word--or even less than intolerablyaggravating the international situation, or the business situationlooks as if it has much less momentum than it appears to have at themoment. I don't know how to quantify that. But if we do anything, wehave to go to $350 million, I suppose; we've practically been thererecently by accident and $250 million is rather a minimal level ofborrowing. I think all we are talking about is putting some verymarginal pressure on the market. How the markets will react, I don'tknow. The danger is that they will overreact. Rather, that is adanger but there's a danger in the other direction, as Mr. Corriganmentioned. I would suggest that we just compromise somehow", "-32-5/24/83MR. FORD. Yes, the market might understand what you'retrying to do if it got to 9 percent. Seriously, isn't it slicing thebologna a little thin to say we're going to snug up 1/4 percentagepoint or less than 1/4 point if we average it", "MS. TEETERS. I thought the $250 million was associated with8-3/4 percent. You're definitely pushing it over 8-3/4 percent, itseems to me", "MR. BALLES. I don't know, but there might be some who wouldview this snugging up as a way of either heading off further increasesin long-term rates or helping to bring them down. That has to be thekey thing. Let's not kid ourselves that the funds rate is going tomake or break the economy. What's going to make it or break it is thetrend of long-term rates", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We're going to be perceived as goingagainst the consensus view of all the governments, including our own,to encourage a worldwide recovery, because people judge that theinflationary problem is considerably reduced--that there's noimmediate prospect for that in the near-term future. We are alsogoing to be perceived as discouraging recovery because of the impacton the international debt burden. And I just think the symbolism ofthis is wrong. It's out of all proportion, I would admit, for a lousy$100 million difference in the borrowing level", " Well, how could we fail to--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You go out of your way to comment ontransactions money. And you're making Ml respectable again", "MR. MORRIS. I think the use of \"transactions balances\" asyou proposed is misleading in the sense that it assumes we can measuretransactions balances. Part of the problem with Ml is that it's now ablurring of transactions balances and savings accounts. And how do weknow transaction balances are up", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The fact is that it comes after six monthsof very high growth that we thought might be slowing down and there issome doubt that it's slowing down", "MR. MORRIS. So you're really making a move based on Ml;you're not making a move based on--SPEAKER(.). No, that's wrong", " I'd like to see us use up some of that slackfor--MR. CORRIGAN. Frank, I wasn't here; you were. But I have ahunch that exactly this same discussion probably took place sometimearound 1976. And I think it's very apparent where we came out, partlyon the grounds that we didn't have to worry about inflation.SPEAKER(.). I think that's pretty unfair", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think that's really an unfairconclusion. Lyle, let's accept the fact that there is somepossibility that a stronger recovery than what we want may materializelater. At the moment you say it's going along on track okay butyou're worried that later on it may materialize. Does that mean thatyou anticipate that now, given the situation", "MR. GRAMLEY. I don't want us to say we're deliberatelypushing up interest rates. That's not the kind of indication that'sgoing to be easy to deal with later on. So, I'd like to use that Mlas a cover", "MR. GUFFEY. Aren't you elevating Ml to a target again", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We don't have to have a money marketdirective; we can go back to an M2, M3 target. I think, though, thatwe wouldn't begin to agree on the numbers for the rest of this period", "MR. BOEHNE. What if we move up \"the evidence of someacceleration in the rate of business recovery\" to replace\"transactions balances have been increasing\" And then the lastsentence would be \"The action was also taken against a background ofsubstantially more rapid growth in Ml.\" That would seem to be moreconsistent with recent directives", "MR. BOEHNE. Yes", "MR. FORD. At $350 million, it's minus $42 million; at $400million, it's plus $8 million", " It's time for me to have--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

TEETERS. Well, where are you going to start our arguing:between increase or existing", "MR. WALLICH. Well, the case for adding that increases, Ithink, as we shift to increasing the degree of restraint", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think there's a very seriousproblem with your formulation, Paul, which is not true of alternativeII, which is this: In effect what you're saying in the first sentenceof your formulation is that while M2 and M3 on the one hand aregrowing below the rates established, since transactions balances havebeen increasing substantially more rapidly than desirable we thereforeare increasing slightly the degree of reserve restraint. In effectyou are telling the market that Ml is now more important than M2 andM3. Do you really want to go that far", "-48-5/24/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think it says that. That's yourreading of it; it's not my reading of it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suppose it will make nobody happy tosay: \"The Committee seeks in the short run to increase\"--or maybe to-49-5/24/83increase only slightly--\"the degree of reserve restraint, recognizingthat, while Ml has been increasing substantially more rapidly thananticipated, M2 and M3 are expected to remain below the rates....\"That explains why it's only slightly", "MR. PARTEE. I can accept it", "MR. GUFFEY. May I ask you, Mr. Chairman, what you believe tobe the advantages of making public 5 or 6 weeks from now the language\"to increase slightly the degree of restraint\". What advantage enuresto the System by publishing that language after the next meeting", "MR. GUFFEY. Well, I don't tend to agree with you, obviously", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't agree with that", " It just soundsa little--MR. PARTEE. No, I don't think so, because to snug onlyslightly in the short run suggests that a little later you're going todo more. \"In the short run we will increase only slightly\" seems tohave a little trend", " Well, you could say marginally, soyou avoid Chuck Partee's--MS.

What he's saying is that the currentaccount estimate shows it worse", "MR. TRUMAN. Yes, because that's the effect of the pricechange. We have a [terms of] trade loss, so the import prices risemuch more rapidly than the export prices. That's why imports arelarger to begin with. So in real terms the net export positionimproves in 1984, as shown in Jerry's figures, but in nominal terms itgets worse because of the terms of trade loss.

Coming back to Governor Wallich'spoint: Most forecasters are projecting a higher rate of inflationthan we are. Certainly, that's the feeling in the financialcommunity; they are looking toward inflation of 5 to 6 percent insteadof around 4 percent. Is it that their assumptions and models aredifferent or is it that they are factoring in, in an intangible way,7/12-13/83psychological expectations, commodity prices, etcetera, and are notbasing it primarily on unit labor costs.

I gather, based on your remarks, that you share to some extentthe view that long rates are influenced considerably by inflationexpectations. And yet the pattern that we see both in your chart aswell as in Appendix I in the Bluebook shows short rates and long ratesgenerally moving up and down together. If you look back a few years,the [unintelligible] doctrine was that if we could convince marketsthat we were going to pursue anti-inflationary policies on into the7/12-13/83future, we would reduce inflation expectations and have downwardpressure on long rates. The thing I'm agonizing about the most, and Iguess a lot of people around the table are, is: What in the heck hascaused this serious increase in long rates since the middle of May orfor about 2 months now. Have inflation expectations worsened or arewe in a new era where if short rates go up, the arbitrage effects aregoing to cause long rates to go up right along with them irrespectiveof any changes or lack thereof in inflation expectations", "MR. MEEK. I'd just add one market factor, which is that theTreasury in the third quarter, for example, will be selling about $60billion of coupon issues to replace approximately $23 billion thatmature.

Is that whatbrought the average down. Something there looks [wrong]; people maywant to examine the consistency. Maybe I'm wrong and there is someobvious statistical explanation, but with half the year gone and asimilar range for fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, I don't know howit comes up so differently on the annual average", "-14-7/12-13/83MR. WALLICH. I would like to come in on the other side. Asmuch as I believe that monetary policy is effective, with a $200billion deficit and no increase in savings I don't see how we couldhelp but get a very strong economy", "MR. CORRIGAN. We did it on one of those trough-to-cyclepeaks, Mike. We took the average for the postwar recoveries, and Ithink it's true that the lines are pretty close together. Well,that's part of my Catch-22. The other part is that even in thecontext of the staff forecast, which is very much like my own, I amworried about the potential for some adverse developments on the upside with regard to inflation. I also think it's true that taking thepostwar cycles as a group we have a situation in this recovery whereraw industrial prices and foodstuff prices are actually rising fasterthan they did in the postwar recoveries even though crude materialsare rising a bit more slowly. We have rapid money growth. The staffis assuming, among other things, that we can hold compensation coststo 5 percent. Maybe we can, but maybe we can't. We're going to get atremendous burst in profits in this quarter and next quarter and howdurable that more moderate rate of wage increases is going to prove tobe is a big question.More generally, again looking back at history for what ittells us, we find that in the second year of recoveries the spread ofprice increases over unit labor costs tends to be about 2 percent,roughly. Again, the staff forecast and my own forecast essentiallyassume that that spread is close to zero in 1984. What that impliesabout pressures on the part of corporations that raise prices is a-16-7/12-13/83good question. It seems to me that the only real hope in terms ofmitigating some of those pressures is that we may get productivitybehavior that's a good deal stronger than what is implied in thestaff's forecast, recognizing that it has its own tradeoffs withregard to how fast unemployment can come down. Now, my concern aboutthose considerations is fundamentally based in a deeper concern that Ihave, and that is that looking out to 1984 in the context in which thedeficit situation and the financing requirements of the Treasury arewhat they are, it seems to me that there is at least a risk, howeversmall, that if inflation started to move up, it could jump up rathersharply. Instead of getting the nice little modest 1/2 point or 1point acceleration in inflation, we could get something well in excessof that in a context in which we would already have enormous pressureson interest rates and in a situation in which financial deregulationhas made it almost an absolute necessity that banks and otherfinancial intermediaries pass through the full cost of higher interestrates onto the borrowers who, in turn, pass them onto the consumerthrough their products. I don't equate that, to take Mr", "MR. MARTIN. I would echo the comments that have been madewith regard to the staff forecast for the balance of this year. Butin answer to your question, Mr. Chairman, I have some problems withthe projection for '84 in specific areas. As far as housing isconcerned, it seems to me that this sector is as usual very vulnerableto the level of rates [rising] 25 or 50 basis points [as shown in theBluebook] in Appendix I. So far as the housing boom--and that's whatit has been, conceding it started from very low levels--almost half ofit has been a function of the first-time home buyer. And it has beenfueled particularly by the fixed rate, fixed term mortgage, whose usethe various housing financial agencies are now attempting to decreaseas strongly as they can--I take it without much attention to what itmight do to the total economy, but hoping that it will solve someproblems that the thrift institutions have. Given a slightly higherset of interest rate assumptions, we can recall the already redfigures for the thrift industry; that sort of impact, of course, isitself a downside factor.-17-7/12-13/83Moving on from housing, we have not talked extensively aboutthe [interest rate] implications for export markets. Indeed, if theinterest rate projections here are on the low side, that would reflecta considerably higher interest burden on both our trading partners onthe one hand and the developing countries' potentials on the other.The impact of these rates on business borrowing I have alluded tobefore. If you take the Aaa figures here and increase them some, thathas employment implications which, in turn, obviously have otherpotential downside effects. What I'm getting at is that if it is truethat small business firms are the source of much of the increase inemployment, which is to say the decrease in the unemployment rate,then somewhat higher rates than these admittedly increased rates haveboth business investment implications--as far as the smaller firms areconcerned there will be less of that--and employment implications withregard to '84, not '83. In other words, it seems to me that we doface a dilemma here in that the interest-sensitive areas are carryingthe increase in economic activity and, therefore, a substantialincrease in economic recovery does indeed have a very low probability,and we have some downside implications that I think we need to be veryaware of as we examine the alternatives for monetary policy for 1984.If we together choose one of the alternatives that is going to push uprates, I think we need to be fully aware of the implications--thesocial costs, if you will, or at least the costs in an economic sensethat we will pay in terms of housing, small business, exportindustries, and other interest-sensitive areas", "MS. TEETERS. I came out with almost exactly what the staffdid for the calendar year 1983 but I am lower for 1984 because I thinkthe level of interest rates will bite once [unintelligible]accommodated. Consequently, I think interest rates will have to godown if we're going to keep [the recovery] going. However, I thinkthe most important assumption here on inflation is the constant levelof oil prices. I think it's a reasonable assumption because of theexcess capacity that's available in the world and the conservationthat has occurred over these 4 or 5 years. If oil prices break loosefor whatever reason, then all of our forecasts are going to be wrong.And that has been the major source of much of the inflation in thepast 10 years. So, I can accept the staff's forecast, but I do thinkthere's more of a problem of slower growth in the year 1984 than theyare currently forecasting", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say that inflation might then behigher", "MR. AXILROD. If velocity were lower. Well, I think velocitythen would be higher, if we have higher price increases", "MR. AXILROD. Lower real growth than projected and moreinflation than projected", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I admire the consistent andpersistent courage of the staff in trying to forecast velocity ofcirculation of Ml. I suppose they have to do it here. The swings areso enormous and so arbitrary and there's so little predictability thatI shudder at the thought that we're really going to come out withmonetary policy conclusions--specifically, targets for M1--based onvelocity of circulation or something", "MR. AXILROD. Well, on balance, we don't think the measuredlevel of Ml has been distorted by the Super NOWs and MMDAs. We thinkthere generally have been offsetting flows in that respect. We thinkthat M1 was distorted by the introduction of regular NOW accounts atthe beginning of 1981 on a nationwide basis; they introduced a savingscharacter to Ml that it didn't have before. And seemingly, so far aswe can judge from the past year's behavior, that has made Ml intechnical jargon more interest elastic. The reason it has made itmore interest elastic is that unlike demand deposits, these accountshave a 5-1/4 or 5-1/2 percent explicit interest rate, so the fall inmarket rates from 20 to 8 percent has reduced the opportunity cost ofholding these to, say, at the low end, 3 percent--[the difference]-21-7/12-13/83between 8 and 5 percent. So, they have moved more sensitively thanthey would have if they had a zero explicit interest rate; one wouldhave had a much bigger loss involved if one had held [demanddeposits].Now, what I don't know is what happens on the reverse side ofthis. If interest rates begin going up, do we get a fast move out ofthese accounts just as we got a fast move into them. If we do, thenwe would have some hope of NOW account growth slowing and money growthslowing. The second thing that has been a problem in Ml is that wesimply have not forecast or made the judgment that demand depositswould grow as strongly as they have. Demand deposits have grown verystrongly and steadily since late last year, except in January andFebruary. I cannot offer the Committee a very strong explanation forthat. In large part, it might be compensating balances; and it alsomight be a foreshadowing of some transactions needs. So, there is alarge element of uncertainty about Ml because it is a new animal.That's why I sound somewhat ambivalent about whether the Committeeshould or shouldn't go back to it as strongly as before", "MR. CORRIGAN. I'd just make a brief comment on this Mlissue. A fellow who works for me did basically the same analysis thatMr. Lindsey did, approaching it in a completely different way, andcame to the same conclusion: that he could explain the growth of Mlby interest rates and income and all the rest of it. My problem isthat I don't believe either one of them. Just to approach it aslightly different way--admittedly, this is a very crude measure--wetook the experience of the Ninth District on the Super NOW accountsand extrapolated it nationwide. We said: What would Ml growth looklike if the average dollar value of Super NOW accounts had stayed justwhere the average dollar value of NOW accounts was, at roughly $5,000as opposed to $16,000. When you do that calculation, at least on thiscrude extrapolation that we did, you end up with the implied Ml growthrate, excluding that marginal savings associated with the higher SuperNOW account balances, of 5 or 6 percent over the first half of theyear. That probably understates it too. But I just cannot believethat one can explain what we've observed in Ml by simply assuming thatthe new shifts into Super NOWs and into MMDAs account for all thatmoving around. I just can't accept it", "-24-7/12-13/83MR. CORRIGAN. I have about as much faith in those numbers asyou do. But even if they offset, it seems to me that you have toconcede that a $15,000 average balance has substantially more of asavings component than a $5,000 balance, much less the balance of anold demand deposit. And that's why I have a great deal of difficultywith Dave's and my staff's analysis", "MR. AXILROD. The midpoint of that, we allege, is consistentwith the staff's [nominal] GNP projection of 8.3 percent. As Jim waspointing out, the Committee's GNP projection is somewhat stronger thanthis 8.3 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but wait a minute. If I read thisright--I hate to put all this weight on these things--for 1984 thereare two rows that are consistent with alternative II, right.SPEAKER(.). The ones through 1984, yes", "MR. AXILROD. Basically, Governor Rice, the problem withusing the model--and what has always given me some pause at least inpresenting the results the model gives to the Committee--is that themodel has embedded in it a long lag in price effects and a short lagin output effects. And it's not at all clear that that is the way theworld works at this very time. That's essentially why every time wepresent [an alternative] that says money growth is going to bestronger, [the economy] will always look better over the near-termhorizon. Output will always react faster than prices. And, ofcourse, the nearer we are to high levels of unemployment, in practiceone would think that's the most sensible thing. So, that is one ofthe problems in presenting these results; it always looks morefavorable in the near term to raise money growth. I would point outstrategies 3 and 4. Strategy 3 slows M2 growth even more than any ofthe alternatives presented and then speeds it up in the latter part ofthe 4-year period. That, according to the model, has a very favorableeffect on prices by 1986 relative to speeding up now and slowinglater", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me raise a question about totalcredit. We have this figure running higher than GNP--I forget by howmuch--at least in the projections for this year; but it's peculiar interms of history. And we have a relatively high total credit targetthis year. It may be appropriate or it may not be, but we maintainthat relationship next year if we only reduce that by 1/2 percentagepoint along with everything else, assuming we do that. Is that reallyappropriate. I guess I'm looking at the staff. Wouldn't you expectcredit to move more in line with GNP over time", "MR. MORRIS. Some people are worried about a rapid expansion", "MR. MORRIS. But if [the premise] is that we don't know whatthe velocity is today, then we shouldn't have a target for M2. Andthat is my position", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think we have enoughconfidence in what the future trends are going to be--not only thelarge deficit, but also the changing institutional arrangements in themarkets. So, it seems to me that the question we again come back tois: Why do we imply that we have that much [omniscience] todifferentiate an extra half point on credit", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think this is too big a deal.What we would say is the opposite--that we implied [omniscience] insaying credit was going to be relatively high this year, which may beright, but it's not going to continue next year", "MR. WALLICH. Some people think it doesn't make muchdifference; other people think it does", " Well, we're going to have to discuss that,but I--MR. PARTEE. The 8 percent on M1 seems to me a little high, Imust say. Didn't we add to that range in order to allow for specialadjustments this year", "MR. PARTEE. I think we did, for Super NOWs and[unintelligible]. Well, we certainly didn't add enough. Now, wecould say the relationship has changed and, therefore, we have anentirely different ball game", "MR. WALLICH. It seems to me that under alternative I we'resaying we're not going to pay attention to it because we can't get itback into the 4 to 8 percent range this year, so we have to monitorit, not target it. If we set it at 7 to 11 percent or something likethat, we do something that has to be changed sharply for the followingyear and brought back to 4 to 8 percent or even lower, and I wouldprefer lower for '84. Now, wouldn't it be possible to rebase insteadand not have these vast changes in targets", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If he's right, it will all work outnicely. If he's not right, then we will have rebased and be over [therebased range]. I think if we rebase it looks as if we're attachingmore importance to it somehow", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My concern is that, as we've seen inthe last couple of months, the markets have once again attachedenormous importance to Ml. All the speculation that the Fed is goingto have to tighten is really coming from the Ml figure because even ifthere's a justification for some modest tightening from the broaderaggregates, it's Ml that has been the discussion point, contrary tothe period right after the initial Humphrey-Hawkins testimony inFebruary. I think putting a numerical target on M1 [is unwise],whether we call it 8 to 12 percent, 7 to 11 percent, or rebase,although I would agree that rebasing may give a shade of nuance ofextra [emphasis] compared to simply moving up to 7 to 11 percent. Ithink there's much to be said, in view of the arbitrariness and theunpredictability of what it's telling us, for suspending the targetfor Ml for the rest of the year and not at this time coming up with an'84 target range for Ml. We would continue to monitor Ml and when itbecomes a little more predictable then come in [with a range] at thatpoint. I don't know how one gets around that problem", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, it's not just what we say [via] thenumbers, it is what we say. We can say it's a target but we aregiving it whatever weight we want to say", "-40-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I had in mind figures very similarto what John Balles mentioned, but I think the real issue is how themarket will react best to what we do. My feeling is that it's betterthat we not rebase, although I understand fully the argument for it.Since you said you thought this would imply more emphasis on Ml, whichis what we also had concluded before we came here, that does argue infavor of [rebasing] from my viewpoint. But I believe the market wouldreact a little better if we kept what we have and you just said thatwe doubt that we will hit it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me try this: Suppose we rebaseand use 4 to 8 percent and say that we think velocity has changed somebut we don't know how much. The 8 percent would allow for very littleincrease in velocity, which is possible, given what has happened. The4 percent would allow for an almost normal increase in velocity fromhere on out. So, we're encompassing that kind of range. We're stillquite uncertain about it and--this will be the tricky part--we're notputting full weight [on Ml], certainly. Just how much weight we saywe are putting on it is the fuzzy area, I suppose. We could go allthe way to saying that we're monitoring [Ml] but putting very little-41-7/12-13/83weight on it. That's one extreme. Or we could say we have a prettywide range and we would get concerned if [Ml growth] was too faroutside that range in either direction, but we're not following itmechanically", "MR. GRAMLEY. I think we ought to listen very carefully tothe substance of what Tony is saying, in the sense that it would be aterrible mistake to impose too much restraint in the second half ofthis year because Ml is going up faster than we now think it might, if-43-7/12-13/83the staff's forecast comes out right. But also, if we seem to saythat we have dismissed altogether the growth of Ml that is likely tobe interpreted, given the present concerns of the market, as [meaning]that we have dismissed any concern about inflation. And that wouldalso be unfortunate. I think we ought to find some way that avoidsboth of those problems", "MR. BLACK. Let me call your attention, if I might, to thelast sentence in Dave Lindsey's memo in which he says it's not clearthat Vl will be less predictable over time than V2 even though Vl maytake on behavioral characteristics that are different from earlierpostwar years", " I agree with that, but the risk--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The basic difference, or point ofdeparture, is that I am somewhat--in fact, substantially--surprisedthat we would stick our necks out with numbers where I, at least, feelthat we are not stabilizing along a particular trend. The fact thatvelocity was not as negative in the last couple of months as it wasearlier in the year, and granted all the Ms had negative velocity lastyear, [does not alter the fact that] the situation is so sensitive tothe changing way people hold balances. I hear people talk about it inthe banks and in the markets. I don't see how we have even a pretenseof a scientific basis for working with and making projections on thebasis of what may be a very unpredictable velocity situation. I don'tunderstand why we would stick our necks out because we can do enoughtightening based on the movements of M2, M3, and credit and the realeconomy without setting out a series of projections that have betterthan a 50-50 chance of turning out to be wrong again. I don't reallyunderstand; I guess many of you, including maybe the staff, must havemuch more faith that the range of predictability is going to besubstantially narrowed. I don't believe that", "MR. WALLICH. I just think that there is such a thing as Mland the market watches it. And [if] we ignore it, we're losingcredibility as well as probably [unintelligible]", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Exactly. Market participants watchit when they think it's influencing our behavior. Secondly, we aregoing to lose credibility with certain kinds of people anyway if wemove to 7 to 11 percent or rebase and wipe out the past. That will begiving Ml more importance, no matter what. Of course, I'll admitthere is a way. Paul could go back to the Humphrey-Hawkins Februaryversion rather than the April version. But even then I think it isgoing to be harder to get back to the February market reaction to Ml", "MR. PARTEE. Well, there are all kinds of opinions. I thinkyou are both overstating it. You have looked at the extremes. Myview of the matter is that history shows that it's dangerous in anexpansion to rely on setting the federal funds rate. We are nowmoving into expansion. We're talking about the next year and a halfby which time we will be pretty well along in the expansion. Theindication is--certainly over the 20 years that I've seen it--that theCommittee is slow to change the funds rate if the funds rate is whatthe Committee is setting. So, I think there's a basic danger in nothaving something else. Now, something else might be nominal GNP; Idon't think it's real GNP. Or it might be one of the Ms. And if it'sone of the Ms, I think Ml still shows itself as better than any of theother Ms. It could be total credit, but on total credit our problemis that it's too hard to estimate the current numbers", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are going to have great trouble gettinga central tendency when I look at these numbers. We have a wholebunch at a high level and we have a bunch at a lower level and there'snothing in between. It worked out pretty well last time, but itceratainly doesn't work out very well this time if my glance at theseis clear", "MR. GUFFEY.

GRAMLEY. No, if we say it may not go up, we're saying ineffect that we're not going to put much weight on Ml until we seenormal patterns of M1/GNP relationships restored. And if, in fact,when we get to 1984, it takes 10 percent growth in Ml to have a decenteconomy, we're prepared to do that", "-54-7/12-13/83MR. CORRIGAN. I don't see that as a problem. If we're facedwith the situation later this year or next year where velocity isn'tgrowing, I think it's a fairly easy matter to make that kind ofadjustment both in policy and what we say about policy. But I don'tthink the reverse follows. If we have a target that's 5 to 9 percentand money supply is growing at 9 percent and the economy is growinglike gangbusters, how do you go up [on the Hill] and explain thatwe're tightening when we're within our target range.

We haven't had time, ashas been pointed out, to get the effect on the mortgage market and theautomobile industry of what we have done already. And the economy,which has had only two quarters of recovery, doesn't strike me as onethat needs a lot of restraint. And it's also one which is fairlytypical. We typically get a quarter like this. We should get somerecovery before we start tightening again; we should let it get backto something close to normal.

I think there are two types of intervention: One is [based on]the modest, narrow concept of countering disorderly markets; the otheris when one wants to lean against stronger trends. And the secondreally should be done not only in concert with other key central banksbut in a package approach in which other actions--not justintervention--are taken. I think what was done fell between those twoschools. Now, it still had a useful purpose. I wouldn't agree withsome of the public comment that it was a complete failure. It had thepolitically useful--and I use the word politically in the verybroadest sense of the term--function of demonstrating that the UnitedStates was willing to meet its Williamsburg Summit commitments ofcooperation. And it certainly checked for a few days the very strongupward trend that seemed to be out of all proportion to the upwardmovement in U.S. [interest] rates. It's quite clear that it didn'tleave a good taste in people's mouths, although some people in themarket thought it was a useful thing to do. On balance, I think thegeneral consensus was that it didn't turn out to be very effective.Secondly, I think there was some irritation on the part of Europeancentral banks that on the key night, a Thursday night, we did notfollow through and do any intervention in the Far East--we had noauthority to do that--when there was a very major movement. And thisfollowed a day on which the Bundesbank on its own had asked thecentral banks of many small European countries to join in on theintervention. And, therefore, it left a rather bad taste in theirmouths and they later came out with this statement that Sam referredto, and I think that just about finished the possibility of any reallyeffective concerted intervention. I only make these comments to giveyou my perspective--a report card, so to speak, of this particularincident. I don't know whether Paul agrees or not", "MR. BALLES. I saw at least one press report that indicatedthe initial intervention by the Treasury was unilateral and did notinvolve coordination with any foreign central bank. I was just goingto ask, Tony, if it's a fair question: Is that true or not", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No, I don't think that's true", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. But on the other hand, Ted, wehad made an enormous amount of money in our intervention. Just on theCarter bonds alone--selling those, which is done to get foreigncurrency--not only was there a large interest rate savings but therewas also a big profit", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know what the basis for thatis. I don't know whether one would get any better results followingborrowings alone; I would suspect not", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Peter may not agree with me, but whatthe experience of the last few weeks--with this very large Treasuryborrowing in the markets--indicated to me at least is that the otherfactors swamped, or were more important than, the size of theborrowing in ultimately determining the level of interest rates in themarkets. So, even though in the early stages of the borrowing therewere considerable interest rate pressures geared to the size of theborrowing, the whole amount got digested very easily with interestrates ultimately coming down somewhat because of other factors. Itwasn't the size per se that caused that much of a problem in theoverall context of current conditions and perceptions about monetarypolicy. I don't know if you would agree with that or not, Peter", "MR. STERNLIGHT. I don't entirely. I think the size was afactor in the extent to which the market backed up. It came downagain very fast, but I think it may be premature to say that themarket has really digested this; it may be regurgitated again, too", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[The floor is] now open for questions andcomments and disagreements and alternative scenarios", "MR. BALLES. Yes, except obviously for 1982, when it justfell out of bed and was hopeless. What we're expecting--and it's aforecast not a fact--is that we're in the process of seeing therestoration of the normal velocity trend in Ml which, if realized bythe fourth quarter as we forecast, would mean a considerably fastergrowth of the economy going into 1984. Our specific monetaryassumption is that for the balance of this year Ml will grow at theupper end of its range and that as we move into 1984 it will grow inthe middle of the 4 to 8 percent range. I think your forecast, Jim,was based on M2 in the middle of the range both for the balance ofthis year and next year. So, it's simply the difference inmethodologies. All sorts of details, of course, would have to beexplored, but just in a gross sense that's why we come out with adifferent forecast. Since we have stronger real growth, we have lessunemployment. Time will tell which of these views is correct", "MR. BALLES. We don't forecast interest rates. We don't knowhow", "MR. FORD. I'm just looking at the trend for the last fourquarters: Starting with the third quarter of 1982, Ml has grown by6.1, 13, 14, and 12 percent and nominal GNP [growth] was well below itfor the first three of those four quarters. Then in the last quarter,the second quarter of this year, velocity has finally made a comebackand is now running ahead. That reinforces in my thinking what John issaying about the likelihood of a rebound toward more normal velocity.What worries me was that we could really see this surge. M1 wassurging way ahead of nominal GNP and now all of a sudden nominal GNPhas zoomed ahead on a concurrent basis. That obviously isn't theright way to look at it, but that's the way a lot of people aroundhere have been talking about it for the last few quarters. So, if youwant to continue talking in that vein, we should now be concernedabout the fact that the second-quarter nominal GNP went up by 13percent when Ml went up by a little less", "MR. MARTIN. I would join Tony only in the comment onhousing. I was convinced yesterday that the interest concessions havebeen so narrow in automobile financing that their removal is not goingto be a material factor in the fourth quarter. But I would argue thathousing in the fourth quarter will be down more likely by 200,000 to250,000 than 100,000 units. The cancellation rates in the escrows inDallas, Chicago, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlantaare such that the sales will not be completed. The rates are floatingup 150 and in some cases 200 basis points. Those sales are just notgoing to be closed and that, of course, will back up into starts andother housing figures. So, as usual, I would indicate a deeper,further degree of pessimism on the housing front", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I thought John Balles was going tomake my speech for me. He started off pretty much the same way, butwe come out with less real growth next year than he did, though a tadmore than the Board staff is projecting. The main difference is thatas we looked at prices next year, we paid right much attention to thebehavior of money in recent months in addition to the effects, as theBoard staff suggested, of a great firming of labor markets, adepreciation of the dollar, and the drought this year. And we believethat's going to result in somewhat higher prices than the staff isprojecting. If I figured it right, they have the implicit deflator[rising] about 4-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of '83 to thefourth quarter of '84; we think [the increase] might be near 6percent. That's really the significant difference between us andJohn", "-10-8/23/83MR. KEEHN. By way of a District report, I must say thateconomic conditions in the Middle West are very significantly improvedand would be broadly consistent with the outline that Jim has given[for the nation]. The only point I'd make--and I think Jim used thephrase \"capital goods are poised for recovery\"--is that the people whoare running the major capital goods firms in the Middle West reallyare becoming very, very discouraged by the outlook. I'm now talkingabout the heavy capital side: foundry equipment, railroad equipment,and heavy trucks. Though things may look a little better off a veryweak base, people on that side of life are becoming terriblydiscouraged that 1983 is by now largely gone and the early part of1984 is to a large extent gone as well. Most of them say the earliestthey expect recovery is in late 1984. So, they continue to be verypessimistic. Perhaps that's typical for this point in a recovery but,as a consequence of all this, our outlook for 1984 would be modestlylower than the Board staff's outlook", "MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have a different forecast,which I've had since February. I did have growth of 8-3/4 percent forone quarter, but I think interest rates at these levels will calm downthe economy, bringing it to the levels we had previous to the lastrun-up during the fall. And my real [GNP] forecast for next year isat the bottom of the FOMC [members' range]. I think [GNP growth] willprobably slow down to below 4 percent, fourth quarter-over-fourthquarter, which will both reduce the inflation rate and increaseunemployment next year. We don't have a stable relationship onvelocity. It may return. Until it does, it seems to me that what ismore important is the level of rates and what that does to economicperformance. So, I'm anticipating a much slower recovery, with allthe consequences that go with that slower rate of growth", "MS. TEETERS. I think there was a great deal of pent updemand, particularly in the housing and automobile areas, that cameout in the early parts of the recovery. As that pent up demand is metand as the rate [increases are felt]--obviously, [housing] is verysensitive to a mortgage rate somewhere between 12-1/2 and 14 percent--we also are going to run out of people who qualify for mortgages atthis level or even at 12-1/2 percent as we move further into therecovery. So, I think that we will see a moderation in housing demandand that automobile demand probably will moderate also. GM, as youknow, raised its prices about 2 percent today. Well, 2 percent, giventhe level they're starting from, makes the real cost of owning an-13-8/23/83automobile very high and rising. And I think people are responding tothat in a very economic way", "MR. PARTEE. I sort of agree with Nancy but for differentreasons. And that is--though I realize Jim has put the saving rateback [up] some--that I just think the projected saving rate is toolow. For the projection period it's around 4-1/2 percent as we gothrough 1984. I think that's an extraordinarily low rate. And it'snot consistent with all the incentives to save that the government hasprovided with IRAs and deferred compensation. I'm not sure whetherthe problem is that income is being understated--it could be--in theforecast. But that means stronger plant and equipment or something toprovide the income that will make for a higher saving rate. Or maybeconsumption is too high. I realize that people, because of pent updemand, can go in and use credit actively and draw down theirfinancial assets in order to take care of their needs; [but] as soonas that's over, I should think that the saving rate would be around 6percent. Therefore, I would come in with a little lower forecast forthe year from the fourth quarter of '83 to the fourth quarter of '84--certainly lower than John Balles has, and lower I think than Lyle has", "MR. KICHLINE. I can't answer explicitly in terms of anumber. I don't know what the model has on that; I don't remember. Ido think that part of what we saw in the second quarter was a wealtheffect, and that was important in the kind of forecast that we have.It's hard to see stock prices zooming on up in the near term; thatmarket has cooled a bit. So, I would use that wealth effect argumentas helping to explain the second quarter. And that [effect] isweakening now, given what is happening in the market", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've had a number of different viewsexpressed here about the outlook. Out of curiosity, how many peoplewould have a forecast significantly higher than the staff forecast. Iwill define significantly higher as roughly 1/2 percent or more on therate of growth over the next 18 months.

Based on the San Francisco money market model,we do not share the view that Ml is in the process of slowing down.Therefore, that leads me to wonder whether the 10 percent funds rateis going to be enough to contain Ml anywhere near the path that wehave set for this quarter.

I would just change the focus a little. Itisn't clear to me what establishment of a borrowing figure by thisCommittee really means. We've been operating on nonborrowed reservesor net borrowed reserves. It appears to me that what we're doing issimply pegging the funds rate at some level and turning over to theDesk and in a sense to you, Mr. Chairman, where that funds rate willrest on a week-to-week basis. I guess I'm raising a question on theoperational procedures that are being followed. If we're following aregime of merely pegging the funds rate, then establishing a borrowinglevel isn't very meaningful because it all cues off of what Peter andSteve believe will give us a 9-1/2 percent funds rate.

What Ifound interesting, though, was a private discussion I had the other10/4/83day with on the one hand and one I had with and[unintelligible]. The views varied sharply. and[unintelligible] believed that capital spending would continue in 1984along typical recovery [trends]; therefore, [for that reason], alongwith other factors, they concluded that interest rates will rise atleast 100 to 150 basis points over the next year. sees noevidence that capital spending will be that strong and he doesn'tbelieve that the inventory replenishment will continue beyond thespring. He says he doesn't believe it is going to return to astatistically normal ratio because he thinks it is ridiculously lownow and can't reflect completely the reality. And unless he is wrongabout inventory replacement, he believes that the recovery will peterout sometime toward the end of the first half of next year. I wouldsay that the view is probably a minority view in thefinancial community. There would be more people reflecting the formerview. And then there is a monetarist view, reflected by an Englishmanwith whom I had a conversation,He's saying that inflation in this country by the fourthquarter of next year will be between 8 and 10 percent and that theinflation rate in Germany also will be very high, based on hisapproach to analysis. So, in some ways, the question of 1984prospects and the so-called crowding out effect of the budget deficitis much more interesting than the current situation. But I don't haveany real difference of view from that which Jim expressed with regardto the current situation. I would add one comment on the currentsituation, which is that aside from the distorting effect of high realinterest rates on different sectors in the economy, there is also thedistorting effect of the exchange rate, which is making thecomposition of what look like normal overall figures somewhatdifferent than we've had before, with certain sectors still being verybadly impacted", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Two-thirds of the Chrysler workers in Ohiovoted against the 12 percent [wage] increase", "-4-10/4/83MR, FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, we don't have any esoterictales either to report from the Sixth District. We would generallyagree with Jim Kichline's estimate. I think the Southeast pretty muchmirrors what is going on in the rest of the country. The economycontinues to expand, although there are a few sectors that are showingsome signs of slowing. Consumer spending remains pretty strong,although the drought and the unseasonably hot weather affected notonly farm prices but consumer spending as well because there were notthe usual back-to-school purchases. Industrial employment iscontinuing to rise. We're looking at some reversals, particularly inthe forest industry. [That experienced by] Georgia Pacific, whichrecently moved to Atlanta, is very much apparent to us in thatparticular industry. Higher mortgage rates have reduced sales of newhomes from the levels that were attained earlier this summer. Itseems to me that 13-1/2 to 14 percent rates are about the choke pointfor most people for new homes as well as existing homes.In the financial sector we've had pretty good deposit andloan growth, although it has been weaker than in June. It's going tobe interesting to see what the results of the deregulation move onOctober 1 will be. I believe that somewhere in the Bluebook orGreenbook there was an indication from the staff that there was notgoing to be as much hype in advertising for these new instruments asthere was before. We don't expect it to be very extensive in Atlantaor in the Southeast, but we do think that it's going to take off tosome extent--that there is going to be more advertising and moreattempts to draw funds through these instruments into the banks andthe S&Ls. Tourism is showing some signs of ebbing particularly incentral Florida, and in the Miami area the tourist industry is adisaster. They are doing very badly and that's true not only in MiamiBeach and Miami but in Dade County generally.If we had some concerns to express--where we would differfrom the staff estimate--it would be on the up side. We think thatperhaps there has been some underestimation of the strength of theeconomy. That is certainly true in our area; we get people talkingabout this quite a lot in our section of the country. After all,throughout this third-quarter period we did have some strikes, such asthe AT&T strike, which I think had an effect on the economy. We hadthe hurricane in some parts of the country. I think we have to takethat into account. So, we would be a little concerned that the third-quarter number is perhaps on the low side and might be revised upward.There is considerable concern in our District, as I'm sure there is inother Districts, about the [federal budget] deficit, and there's agreat deal of concern in the export-related industries about thestrength of the dollar. Interestingly, inflation in two of our majorcities, Atlanta and Miami, is running about 1.3 to 1.4 percentagepoint above the national average, so that's a concern. Because ofalready existing inflation in those cities and the threat of increasedfood prices as a result of the drought, we see some pressure onprices.One other thing I might mention is related to industrialproduction and capital expansion. Some of the contacts we've had withindustrial development agencies around the District indicate to usthat a lot of the capital expansion is being designed to improveexisting productivity rather than to meet additional product demand.And finally, Mr. Chairman, there is a good deal of concern in Atlanta10/4/83and Miami about the Eastern [Airlines] situation. Governor Martin'sremark about concessionary bargaining certainly bears on this. Thisis a good example of the union leaders not being supported by theirown people. I'm not sure they're in the old man/old lady category butthe flight attendants, for example, are now coming forward andindicating that perhaps they would rather have wage concessions thanhave Eastern go under. In other words, they are tending to believemanagement rather than their own union", "MR. PARTEE. I thought the indication was that that was non-union people", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Their projection shows a reduction inhousing", "MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, there are two things that worryme about the staff forecast. One is that it is so similar to a widevariety of forecasts that exist in the private sector. The staffprovided us with the usual summary of forecasts that they follow--Chase, Wharton, DRI and Merrill Lynch--and it's amazing how closeeverybody is. Real growth next year ranges from 4.2 to 4.7 percent;inflation rates measured by the deflator are somewhat higher than thestaff's forecast but are very uniform at a little over 5 percent;everybody expects the unemployment rate to drop to somewhere around8-1/4 percent by the end of 1984; and interest rates are expected tostay about where they are or maybe go up a little, but certainly notvery much by the standards we've seen in recent years. You know, wheneverybody forecasts the same thing, something is bound to be wrong.There has to be something coming along that we have not foreseen.The second thing that worries me is that the outlook seemsjust too good to be true. And if I could lay out the way I want it orwhat can reasonably be hoped for in terms of a course of economic andfinancial development next year, what I would hope for is a growthrate that slows down to the range of 4 to 5 percent--enough to makefurther progress on unemployment and not so rapid a growth rate togenerate any unusual inflationary pressures. I'd want a combinationof developments that keeps interest rates about where they are orgoing down a little, pushing off any serious crowding out problemuntil 1985 and beyond. I've listened to the comments around the tableas to which way the risks go, and the sentiment tends to be that therisks may be on the up side. I've asked myself [that question] and Iwould assess the risks as fairly well balanced. But I would agreethat the thing we ought to worry about most from the standpoint ofpolicy is not that we will get a weaker economy but that we will get astronger one with more inflation. If we get a weaker economy, myfeeling would be that we have enough pent up demand for housing andfor consumer durable goods that, with a moderate decline in interestrates which certainly would not be unwelcome, we could keep therecovery going. But if we got a considerably stronger recovery andmore inflation and began to get significant pressures in creditmarkets with money growing very rapidly, we would have to resist.Then we would have significant problems. So, really, I hope thingswork just the way the staff forecasts. But what I worry about most isthat the recovery might be stronger with more inflation later on", "MS. TEETERS. I want to go back to Frank Morris' questionbecause I think we are beginning to see some evidence of crowding outand I think we see it in interest rates. The table on page 5 of the[Greenbook] supplement shows that the federal funds rate has gone up56 basis points since its recent low in May, and the longer-termTreasury securities--the 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasuries--havegone up 2 to 3 times the change in the short-term rates. Then we seethe decline of 37 basis points in the fed funds rate since the last-13-10/4/83FOMC meeting and almost no decline at all in the rates on longer-termsecurities. So, I think we're seeing the crowding out in terms of theincrease in long-term rates. And those longer-term rates may becrucial to getting the type of recovery that the staff forecasts.That hits housing and it hits capital goods. And it may be thatthat's what will show up as the crowding out. You also remember thatin the July/August refunding the Treasury had quite a bit of troubleselling longer-term issues, and the rates had to go up in order [forthe market] to digest those issues. So, I think we're seeing a newform [of crowding out]--one that hasn't been recognized before", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The report in theTenth District is not unlike others that have been given around thetable. That is, retail sales have remained fairly vigorous; theagricultural sector is under some pressure although I would note thatin our District it involves only the corn and soybean crops whereaswheat has not been affected since it was harvested before the droughtreally hit. On the other hand, the PIK program has maintainedliquidity within the financial system that finances the agriculturalsector. Perhaps the greatest impact would be on those suppliers tothe agricultural sector--I'm talking about farm machinery and othermanufacturers who are doing no business now and do not expect to intothe next year. Energy, mining, and housing, of course, are very muchas has been described in other Districts.I was interested in Governor Gramley's comments because Iagree that [the forecast] is almost too good to be true. I disagreeonly with his last comment in that I think the risks may be on thedown side instead of the up side. I too would hate to see a lot ofvigor show up in 1984 because it would present the problem that hedescribed. By the same token this forecast seems to me to be largelybased upon two or three assumptions: that consumer spending willremain very vigorous; that capital spending will come on very early in1984; and, lastly, that the dollar will decline and thus improvesomewhat the export market and our balance of trade problem. We haveseen the saving rate return to the 5 percent level; if that were tocontinue or go up to some level closer to historical experience, thenI assume that consumer retail purchases would be muted somewhat.Similarly, fixed investment may not come on. It appears that theremay be a change in the way companies plan their fixed investment.That is, if I understand it correctly, it used to be that we would seefixed capital investment coming on [stream] at a utilization rate inthe area of 80 to 85 percent. It seems to me that [businessexecutives] are much more cautious now, having come out of a three-year recessionary experience, and are not going to be as quick to makethose capital commitments. Lastly, as to the dollar, the staff--and Ithink everybody--has been expecting a dollar decline over the lastyear, and it really hasn't happened. I just note that part of theforecast is based upon agricultural export levels that our peoplejudge will not be achieved either in 1983 or 1984. They are lookingat an annual export level of about $36-$37 billion in 1983 and I thinkthe USDA just announced a figure of roughly $34-1/2 billion. Now,that [difference] is not big in magnitude but for 1984 I think thestaff is projecting an agricultural export number of about $40 billionand our people think that it likely would be in the $35 billion rangeor thereabouts. And it is going in the wrong direction, which is onepoint that I want to make. I like what I see but I would suggest thatthe risks may be on the down side rather than the up side. I don't-14-10/4/83think that suggests anything in terms of action by the Federal OpenMarket Committee at this meeting, but I'm not sure that all is as goodas it may appear", "MR. TRUMAN. Well, as we said yesterday, Governor Teeters, itdepends a lot on what you assume as you go out [in time] about howgrowth is proceeding here and abroad. If we continue with growth hereat or above the average rate abroad, which is consistent with manyforecasts, then you have to catch up with that. That's basically thereason why that 15 percent depreciation doesn't give us much more thanstabilization as we go out. But if we return to a more normal--whatone might perceive to be more normal--cyclical position, it wouldinvolve probably having faster growth in foreign countries than here.Then we would need less of a further depreciation in order to bringthe current account deficit down substantially", "-15-10/4/83MR. WALLICH. It's hard to make a coherent case one way orthe other that differs from the staff position. I would say that thestaff forecast differs [from other forecasts] in one significantrespect: namely, that it has lower inflation. If it has lowerinflation, then given interest rates that are somewhat similar to whatother forecasters have, we would have a higher real interest rate. Idon't know to what extent that in turn enters into the projection ofinvestment spending. But as for the present level of investmentspending, as has been pointed out, it's very bad in the heavy capitalgoods area. I think overall we can't say that the business fixedinvestment is bad. On the contrary, it seems to be a little largerthan it has been in other expansions. Evidently, there's a greatshift in the nature of the investment away from the smoke-stack typegoods that one observes in the middle of the country to hightechnology-type equipment. But secondly, and this was veryinteresting, maybe the heavy equipment area is additionally hit by thelarge current account deficit--that is, the weakness in our tradebalance which, of course, takes the form of imports of things fromabroad that we didn't usually import previously. I think the netexport area is really the greatest [source of] weakness in theeconomy. If we didn't have that, we would have a much strongerexpansion. I'm concerned in the same area as Nancy is but maybe aboutthe opposite things. Suppose that the dollar does not go down asprojected and as has been projected many times by now. In that case,of course, that gap in the trade balance becomes worse. Now, I agreethat we're subject to the possibility of shocks from the developingcountries or from wage developments, perhaps incited by large profits.These things are unpredictable. We're getting into the area whereprofessional economists tend to see a lack of demand over the horizon.As far as one can see, things are not too bad. Beyond that, one can'ttell what is going to keep the economy going. I would say that thisis probably an economic recovery cyclically like all others. If itlasts two years, it would have been short; if it lasts over threeyears, it would have been very good. And if we cannot see it clearlylasting longer than three years, that would not be a great surprise", " There's a relatively small impact on Europe and--MR. PARTEE. Well, Japan doesn't look particularly strong.And, of course, Canada still has 12-1/2 percent unemployment. So, Ijust don't see too much there. But I think if something is wrong withthe forecast, it's in that area--some result of the very, very unusualtrade deficit and the very unusual potential for a drop in the dollar.And that's going to upset the apple cart. I can't say what it is, butthat's the area I would refer to as the most problematic", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's the line they've been taking.The Chancellor of the Exchequer told me that he thought [the UKeconomy] was going to be even better in the second half than in thefirst half, which most people are saying is not so", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's a pretty strong statement. Iwas about to say that I was struck by everybody's optimism around thetable. Now you tell me there's no world recovery. It seems to methat the business news has been quite mixed recently and everybody isperfectly willing--maybe with your exception--to look through this andsay [the economy] is really very good or reasonably good and is goingto continue. All the economists who can't see over the horizon areperfectly willing to see out to the next 18 months anyway--at leastthose around this table--and say that things are going to be fine, ororderly, or whatever. Now, I do think that has a bearing on ourcurrent policy decision. I'm not sure that the news is all thatuniformly good statistically, but I hear a lot of optimism around thetable on balance. And it may be right. I'm not arguing that it'swrong. That's just the conclusion I take from the discussion aroundthe table: Ignore all these soft figures. People are feeling prettygood.But looking out into the future and questioning what can gowrong, I think a lot of things can go wrong, none of which can beeasily incorporated into a forecast of the kind that the staff has tomake. I would put this debt problem at the top of the list, and letme return to that. But let me just make a comment about the oilsituation, just on the other side of Mr. Roberts' comment. If wereally had a disturbance in the Middle East, which people worry aboutnow in terms of the Iraq/Iran war getting more aggressive andinvolving an impairment of the oil flow from the Gulf area, I think itis true that, looking at the United States position alone, we importrelatively little [from Iraq and Iran]. And one could say that ifthat supply were almost cut off, we could probably make up that gaprelatively easily. I don't remember the exact figures but the MiddleEast still supplies 35 percent of the world's oil or something likethat in exports", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that may be if just Iran and Iraqwent. That's a big assumption--whether it can be confined to them. Istill think there might be a bit of a problem, but you're talkingabout a more manageable [situation]--not U.S", " And the fighting would spread intothe Gulf and straight to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If they ever reach peace there, we'dprobably have a surplus. I guess that's something one can't evaluate.This exchange rate problem and our export problem are all mixedtogether. As many people have said, it's a new ingredient. I don'tknow whether to worry more about the exchange rate remaining high ordeclining precipitously. I think either would give us very realproblems. This wage situation is very uncertain in my mind; itdepends upon psychology and expectations. I get ultimately buoyed upwhen I see some figures and ultimately discouraged when I analyze some[other] figures and the lack of any big adjustment, as I suggestedearlier, in industries that have not been severely impacted by therecession--the financial industry and the utilities industry to nametwo. All of these things don't tell me very clearly what policyshould be.But let me return to the debt issue for a moment. The brightspot there, of course, continues to be Mexico. Even there it has tobe looked at with some degree of realism, I suppose. Their externalfinancial condition is substantially better. They have a certainamount of cash; they haven't drawn upon all the bank loans they candraw upon. They will be in a position to go back to ask the banks forsignificantly less money next year, even assuming their imports rise.And they probably will get lower rates in the process. If everythingelse goes smoothly there, it will probably be a simpler process thanit was last year. But at the same time, even looking at Mexico alone,there aren't many signs apparently of an increase in economic activitythere. They're still at the bottom in terms of their own domesticbusiness picture and they've had a more severe contraction than theprogram planned in the first place. It's not unlikely, I suppose,-19-10/4/83when you begin making a vigorous adjustment that it will go a littlefurther than you estimated. That's part of the reason why they lookso much better--fairly dramatically--externally. They have even fewerimports than they were assuming when they took the contractionarymeasures. Of course, we're feeling the other side of that in ourtrade picture. But still, I think one could say that they are in aposition to [have] some expansion consistent with financial stabilityif nothing else goes wrong among their neighbors or elsewhere in theworld. That prospect isn't exactly safe; we have had Brazilstruggling for months and months. And partly because they have beenstruggling for so many months, I think the political support for astrong adjustment program has deteriorated within Brazil. They had apolitical setback a few weeks ago when the Congress reared up andrejected a wage law. That is of no substantive significance initself, but the opposition demonstrated that it could reject the wagelaw and by implication that they intended to reject the wage law thatis the centerpiece of the Brazilian program", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it has a month-and-a-half or so torun at the maximum. They might do it by avoiding a vote. There maybe some maneuvering to have a vote and try to get it passed, but it'sa very tenuous situation. Mainly because of that situation, I thinkthe prospect of getting any short-term financing into Brazil hasevaporated, and their arrears are getting bigger and bigger; and theyhave arrears of the kind that will produce nonperforming loans overthe third quarter. I don't know if that's any disaster, but it willbe an interesting psychological test of the market when banks have toreport nonperforming Brazilian loans in some magnitude. On the otherhand, we did manage to put together in principle a basic financingprogram for Brazil if they carry through on their adjustment program.That money wouldn't be available before the end of the year, but inprinciple the outlines of that--a combination of bank money and publicmoney--are set to go forward. It will not go forward unless theycarry through on the adjustment program, and that is very much inquestion. As I suggested, it may not go forward anyway because westill have a big problem of getting all the banks to join in. Thelead banks have agreed in principle; they haven't gotten all the otherbanks to agree yet. But it's going to remain a quite tenuoussituation. Argentina is in a particularly political period before anelection. It has been mentioned that they already have taken actionsthat are inconsistent with their IMF program and it's a question as tohow long they can be said to be in compliance with it. The actualspecific tests of that program have not yet been violated, lookingback, but it's virtually certain that they will be, looking forward.The [situation] has heated up internally in terms of negotiations withthe banks to the point that they put the central bank governor in jailyesterday", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. These are not the only countries involved.Some of the medium size countries in Latin America are not in good,though not in terrible shape. Chile, Peru, Equador--none of them isin good shape, but they maintain their equilibrium. Venezuela hasbeen taken care of and an election is coming up, so it should beeasier; but there are still very tense political pressures. And thereare countries elsewhere in the world, notably the Philippines andNigeria, that are on the verge of real problems. The Philippinessituation is obviously complicated by their political problems on alarge scale, quite apart from their economic problems. That makes itvery difficult to deal with the economic problems.The risks [in this country] are at least as large as theyhave been and in my judgment may be larger. I don't know what thedefinition of crowding out is, but the only way I can see reallyimportant short-term relief--by short term I'm talking about a year orso--would be to have interest rates decidedly lower. The chances ofhaving interest rates decidedly lower with the budget deficits of themagnitude that we are running do not seem self evident to me. Growthobviously is terribly important, but growth acts over a period ofyears. To get real leverage on their external flows in the short run,interest rates would act over a period of a year if we had a decidedreduction in them. Because their debts are so big, Latin America Isuppose would get $4 to $5 billion of debt relief if we had a couplepercentage points reduction in interest rates. We would not get-21-10/4/83anything like that from the growth side in that kind of time period.Yet, it is hard to be optimistic that that is going to come about. Isee nothing there but their continuing to hang on by their fingernailsfor the indefinite future. As for these special IMF programs,Governor Martin, I think it is worth saying--IMF or not--that theconstraint is the shortage of finance. And if we didn't have an IMF,I suspect they would be involved in even more contractionary programssimply by force of circumstances if they were unable to raise themoney abroad. So, it's a risky picture from that side", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but that assumes that they canstill get IMF help", " I'm asking--MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't know. How would they get bridgefinancing for it. And if they move the cash to the United States,wouldn't the banks take it. It would be a very difficult period", "MR. MARTIN. And [there would be problems in] the flow offoodstuff and spare parts after a period in which the inflow offoodstuff and spare parts has been down. They already have cut theirimports. Add on to that a difficulty of importing--GOVERNOR WALLICH. I tell them that too because I have tomake a case. I just want to say to you that the case is not veryconvincing", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know either. But so far, theyhave not been willing to take the chance. That's what you can say.So far as the rest of the IMF meeting is concerned, let me say thatthere has been a lot of stuff in the newspapers. The tone, from whereI saw it--and maybe I didn't see it all--was reasonably good. TheUnited States took what was considered to be a very tough linespecifically on some of these IMF issues. A lot of the rest of theworld didn't like it much and certainly some of the developingcountries didn't like it much. But there was a tendency to say thatwe had to do that because of the IMF legislation, so we got excusedfor a lot of things we ordinarily wouldn't be excused for, I suspect.There was a feeling, which I don't think is entirely true, that it waspolitically necessary in the United States. The people were quitehappy that the President very strongly supported the IMF legislationin a very uncompromising way publicly--more strongly than he hadbefore in a public statement of this sort. That was accepted at facevalue and thought to be very, very encouraging. There was a greatdeal of worry about whether we will in fact vote for the IMF packagein the end and a lot of concern as to what would happen if that fails", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have a question. These velocities onchart 8 look a little different--maybe it's a difference in scale--than those on chart 1. Are they computed differently", "MR. AXILROD. Yes", "MR. WALLICH. I find it difficult to rely on velocity as ameasure of the usefulness of an aggregate because if velocity isvariable but determined by factors that can be measured in relation toit, principally interest rates, then the demand function for thataggregate will be stable even though velocity is not. And it seems tome that we have to factor that in before we judge the aggregates. Thedemand function I guess is pretty standard in the profession but haslately been buried among researchers. And I think efforts should bedirected toward getting a better grip on what is the right moneydemand function than on the stability of velocity", "MR. BALLES. I would agree with that, Governor Wallich. Infact, one of the main thrusts of the paper that I distributed wasthat, in our view at least, demand for M1 has not been unstable inrecent times--that what we witnessed in '82 and in the first part of'83 was not a shift in the demand for money but a movement along agiven demand function as interest rates came down and people wantedmore money. That's not the same as a shift in the demand for money;that's moving along a demand function. And therein, I guess, lies oneof the differences in analysis between us and Steve", "MR. AXILROD. I think there are some technical disputes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you have some disagreement there.Do you have 2 minutes on current policy, Mr. Axilrod", "[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You all heard Mr. Axilrod's opinion thatthe real question is what to do if these various aggregates begingoing off track. The implication is that there isn't much to do atthe moment. Although he didn't say it explicitly, I suppose thatsuggests some version of alternative B, which he interprets as nochange for the moment, assuming nothing goes off track. I will raise-27-10/4/83that question anyway, as to whether that's a reasonable startingpoint", "MR. PARTEE. I think that's probably the question isn't it,Paul--whether they are going to snap back in the way projected", "MR. PARTEE. A little less", "MR. PARTEE. I don't agree with that. I would be evenhandedand I would react to an appreciable change in the aggregates in eitherdirection", "-33-10/4/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If the real economy were showingsigns of weakening, even though the money supply was still in theupper half but within the range, it might still be a situation wherewe would do some easing. That's a mixed case", "MR. PARTEE. That's even another combination--high money anda low economy", "MR. AXILROD. This week we're aiming at $200 million. Yes,it's $450 million and $650 million, so probably we're very close to$200 million. We may hit it with higher borrowing or higher excess", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, except right now as we're meetingthe funds rate is quite high", " Yes, that one week--MR. GRAMLEY. Well, it isn't just one week. Throw out thatone week and now the range on borrowings goes from $647 million to$1.2 billion and on net borrowed reserves from 0 to $700 million", " Yes, but I think the problem--MR. PARTEE. I like the word \"maintain\" and I like the words\"slightly easier", " That's also consistent with what we would havedone because of the way the aggregates came in from the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I don't think there's any trouble inrationalizing it with the previous directive", "MR. CORRIGAN. There's a Catch-22 here, though. My concern,as I said before, is that, if anything, the economy may be strongerthan the forecast and then inflation might be greater than theforecast. I think that way because in some ways the focus now shouldbe 1984 rather than just the fourth quarter of 1983. Personally, Iwould be happier if we came out someplace closer to between \"C\" and\"B\" rather than \"B.\" I think the Catch-22 is very important becauseif the economy is stronger and inflationary pressures are greater,then we get Frank Morris' collision sooner rather than later. And ifthat happens, we will not have helped the LDC problems; as a matter offact, it works the other way. I get troubled by this whole argumentthat says that the solution to the LDC debt problem is [for us] toease monetary policy. The real solution is beyond our control: It'sa tighter fiscal policy. But I think there is some danger inoverplaying that and ending up with just the results that we're tryingto avoid", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I agree with that to the extent that if weget too aggressive--and we're talking in a limited range here, Iunderstand--and take too many risks of having the aggregates and theeconomy moving up on us, it may help to bring a little glimmer of hopeto the LDCs for three weeks, but then we will put an arrow throughtheir hearts", "-39-10/4/83MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, if I may: There are an awfullot of uncertainties out there. And it would seem to me that thecontingencies that might arise--for example, the LDC crisis orsomething like that--can be dealt with on a conference call and aspecial meeting of the Committee. But I really have two concerns.One is the strength of the economy. As I said before, we tend to seethe economy growing more rapidly than perhaps other forecasters. Theforecast for the second quarter was certainly not very accurate. Itcame in at 9.7 percent, appreciably above what people thought. So,that's a worry that I think we ought to have. The other concern to meis that [we ought not just] look at the growth of the monetaryaggregates over the last couple of months alone but back up and lookat what has been happening to monetary growth since August of 1982.In the period from August '82 to June '83 we had very rapid monetarygrowth. So, it seems to me when we're deliberating about a specificpolicy option, we have to take into account those two periods of time.Because the aggregates in the short term--and I guess even in the longterm--are within the targets, there doesn't seem to be any particularneed to have a more restrictive policy at this time. On the otherhand, since we have had some accommodation--some ease in the monetaryaggregates and some base drift, I might add, in rebasing--I think itwould be premature to ease at this time. So, I would opt for a targetsomewhere between \"B\" and \"C.\" If we did that, we would be able tocome in somewhere near the middle of the range for Ml. If my numbersare right and if that kind of policy were followed, it seems to methat Ml growth would still not be restrictive over the long term. Mlcould grow at a little over 6 percent from September to December andstill reach the midpoint of the target range. That still would implyfourth quarter-to-fourth quarter growth of about 10.4 percent, so sucha policy is still not restrictive in any sense. What it comes down toin my mind is that we ought to opt for a steady-as-you-go policy andnot change policy at this time. And as I say, the contingencies thatmight arise can be dealt with specifically", " I don't interpret that as staying within the range that wasset, which is an operating--MR. GUFFEY. No, and that's my point. If it doesn't have anyimplication for staying within the range, why set a range", "MR. AXILROD. On the assumption that there's a furtherincrease in the week of the 28th, it would get you 14 percent growthif it steadily grew $1-1/2 billion through the course of that month", "MR. MARTIN.

PARTEE. You've taken a fairly restrictive definition ofprice stability. How sensitive is this last table to that", "MR. BOEHNE. I would like to second what Frank said aboutproductivity. There have been a number of changes in the industrialstructure and demographics and I think your assumption probably is onthe pessimistic side. The point that I want to make is that thisbaseline case is really a gradualist approach to price stability and Ithink that's the right way to do it for this kind of analysis. Butmore realistically we would likely have a recession, say, in 1986 or1987. I wonder how sensitive this model is to having a third11/14-15/83recession in a period of 6 or 7 years. We have seen lots of forecaststhat are always based on a gradualist approach--that we're going tobring inflation down gradually. In reality, if you look back at thehistory of inflation, inflation really only comes down throughrecessions. The last time we really knocked inflation in the head wasin the 1950s when we had three recessions over about an 8-year periodgoing into the early 60s. So, my question is: What does a recessiondo in terms of bringing down inflation and in terms of these realvariables", "MR. TRUMAN. Right. It is likely reduced by about 0.3throughout the period as a result of the slower growth in the UnitedStates. So, it's a little under 3 percent on the baseline projection,which is basically the staff forecast, and it's a little closer to 2.5or 2.6 percent after you take account of the impact of the UnitedStates on the rest of the world", "2 of a percentage point a year lower than what we--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

So the implication is rising interest rates inthe short term in order to produce a decreased rate of real growth andprice stability", "MR. WALLICH. Can you tell me a little about the period overwhich the data in the model reach. My impression is that the modelderives its data mostly from a period in which nobody believed thatinflation could be reduced to .7 percent, and so it naturally hasbuilt in a very strong resistance to that. Now, if we could have acredible policy--if it were believed that your alternative assumption,the last one [listed], is possible and will be done--wouldn't thatinvalidate many of the assumptions underlying the past data", "MS. TEETERS. Is the message you are trying to deliver herethat the credible disinflationary policy is basically a long period ofvery high real interest rates and high unemployment. Is that the onlyway we can obtain low or close to zero inflation", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think, though, that the result iseven worse than you have there. You have real interest rates risingsteadily from present levels to a point where eventually they areabout 4 percentage points or so higher than they are now. I find itinconceivable that we wouldn't have a recession in this period. Andfor a period of time we would have a much higher level of unemploymentthan you have. At least that seems to me more likely", "MR. GRAMLEY. And if we accept the definition of pricestability of the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,we're almost there", "MR. GRAMLEY. You're always above the natural rate ofunemployment. All that is happening then, if you reduce the extent towhich you get improvement, is that you have the speed limit effect.The speed limit effect in any case is one that has been much indispute; not everybody believes the speed limit hypothesis.

And in alternative C the T-bill rate is up in the 9-1/4to 9-3/4 percent range with a slight rise in long rates. My questionis: Given the dramatic drop in inflation we've already had, what isholding interest rates up at those levels. Might it not, in fact, beinflation expectations", "MR. BLACK. If I understand the Phillips curve analysisproperly, your inflation forecast depends upon the markup over cost.Is it possible that international competition could intensify to thepoint that that could be very difficult to accomplish andsignificantly affect your inflation forecast", "MR. CORRIGAN. No. I think there's some good news and somebad news. The bad news is: My hunch is that, if anything, the modelas we're talking about it here probably underestimates the amount ofinflationary pressure in this period, even though I would agree thatit's likely that we're going to have more productivity growth than themodel suggests. My reason is that I think inflationary expectations,however latent, are probably stronger than this model contemplates.And I continue to believe that the speed effect, if that's what it'scalled, in the short run will hurt quite a bit if prices even begin topick up moderately--say, gravitate up to 5 percent", "MR. CORRIGAN. Yes", " One can spendTreasury bonds as readily as currency, perhaps--MR. CORRIGAN. No, I don't think you have to associate themrigorously, but it does say that financing the deficit in effect canonly be done in one of two ways: through new money, however defined,or through inflation. But if you get rid of the deficit and you getrid of that constraint, then you can have real growth and the realinterest rate at about the same level, 3 or 4 percent", "MR. CORRIGAN. And interest rates are very high and growth isvery low", " The general impression I get from this model,frankly--aside from congratulating you on having the courage to remainat zero inflation, which was by request--MR. KICHLINE. False courage", " Unless you're lucky on some of theother things, such as productivity and a couple of other things--MR. MARTIN. Let me tie on to that with a collateralquestion: Is there a one-to-one unemployment increase if you, let'ssay, come down 1 percent in the rate of growth with containedinflation", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I understand that. But if we wereable to prevent the rate of inflation from going up beyond the presentlevel during the rest of this recovery, though I don't think we willbe, I would guess that there would be a very, very widespreadexpectation in the financial community that the next recession wouldbring the rate of inflation down significantly. We would get a veryfavorable expectational result if, over the next year or year-and-a-half, we could stabilize this level of inflation", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but isn't that a lower velocitythan we normally adhere to", "MR. PARTEE. Yes, it does", " Well, I think a different model, like the onethat Tony talked about that incorporates--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Does the Congress know this", "MR. CROSS. We would revise it", "MR. PARTEE. Is this to make it more parallel with the otheragreements", " This contingency would be if we drew yenand invested--MR.

I remember thereis a difference between the Senate bill and the House bill", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's consistent with a provision inthe IMF legislation. But we would be taking the action a little inadvance in a sense. Presumably, the legislation will have passedanyway. It's totally consistent with the Senate version of the IMFlegislation but it raises some questions of precedent. It will be thefirst time we have done it and will raise those kinds of questions.It won't apply to any of these countries that are in negotiation withthe IMF or have IMF programs and so forth, but I think it will send alittle tremor through the banks", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's very hard to know what this reservingis for our banks or other banks. They say they reserve. The questionis whether they are increasing their total reserves more than they-34-11/14-15/83otherwise would or are saying within some total they have anyway thatthey are allocating this to Brazil, Mexico, or whatever. I don'tthink anybody knows the answer to it completely", " For these $300 million--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Or they will write them off.

Our banks are very reluctant to write off or reserve in away that really adds to the reserves. It has been argued so manytimes that we can't do enough to make any difference, and it justraises questions about the loans. Our banks operate more in agoldfish bowl than any of these other banks who can write off withouttelling anybody their reserve [unintelligible] and they haven't gotany hidden reserves. The allegation by many of our banks is that theyare reserving whereas these other banks are not really reserving.They just move something out of hidden reserves into calculatedreserves", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We still don't have a definitiveclarification from the Comptroller on the legal limit being exceededand how that is to be treated when everything gets rolled over", "MR. MARTIN. It's a bit of price-fixing by the Congress", "]MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I think the staff forecast is aboutright, but it's a little cautious on the current quarter. The currentquarter seems to me possibly a little stronger than is forecast. Ithink the economy is slowing down from the third quarter, but not asmuch as [the staff projects]. I'm particularly impressed with thelabor market numbers. There has been some decline in industrialproduction over this month from last month. But all the other numbersseem to show continued strength at roughly the same momentum as in thelast quarter. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see this quarter turnout closer to a 7 percent real rate of growth than the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2percent that has been forecast. So, I would say the forecast for thisquarter is a cautious one. Again, I think the longer-run forecast for1984 is about right. The main difference that I would see is that thestrength of consumer expenditures may continue longer into the earlypart, or the first half, of next year. And the swing toward inventoryaccumulation may last longer than is projected, which of course wouldthen mean that the growth rate for the first half of next year wouldbe somewhat higher than is now forecast. I would consider that to beunlikely. But I mention it just to suggest that if there is any errorin the forecast, it is that the outcome is likely to be stronger thanis now forecast. I was one of those people, I would remind you, whoin the spring of this year were concerned about whether the recoverywas really as strong as most people thought it was. I'd like to saynow that I am convinced and that it's probably stronger than forecast", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, we'll put Mr. Truman on the spot. Ithink one of the areas of potential weakness is on the foreign side.Obviously, as the dollar continues to be very high, it raisesquestions about performance on the foreign side. That's one area of[potential] weakness. Another may well be in residential constructionactivity. We've seen fluky numbers there--shooting up in August anddropping back in September. Our view is that that's about the bottom,but that's not necessarily clear. It could easily go a bit weaker.Another is this dramatic increase in business fixed investment, whichhas shown up in terms of orders and shipments in the durable equipmentarea. And we've had a lot of gyration on the building side innonresidential construction. There were deep declines in commercialconstruction in the spring and then big increases in the summer, andit's hard to read those numbers. It may well be that there's not asmuch happening on the structure side of business fixed investment, andthat would turn our forecast weaker. I would note particularly thatwe continue to get very bearish reports in office construction; thenumbers are still quite weak. We have built in here a flattening outof that--very little growth next year. But it may well be, given thedramatic increase in vacancy rates in many areas across the country,that office building construction is winding down and will go moredeeply negative. So, in the investment area and in residentialstructures and the foreign sector I think there are potentialnegatives", "MS. TEETERS. You have assumed that interest rates are goingto stay where they are now, is that right", "MR. KEEHN. I just have a comment on capital goods,particularly for those industries or those companies in the MiddleWest. While there has been some improvement, I think, nonetheless ina broader perspective many of these industries are still doing very,very poorly. We took a look at four components of the industrialproduction index--farm equipment, construction equipment, metal works,and railroad equipment--all of which are terribly important in theMiddle West. We compared their current levels of operations with thethird quarter of 1981, which was for many of them a high point. Andthese four individual sectors are still operating at a very, verydepressed level. I'm sure they will come along, as Jim is suggesting,but I also think some of them have undergone some pretty importantstructural changes. They are still operating at very low levels andthe people running these companies continue to be quite depressedabout the outlook. So, if there's any error at all, in my judgment itcertainly is in that area on that side", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I'm getting worried about whether or notwe're going to get the speed and the degree of slowdown that the staffhas forecast. I agree with Governor Rice that the current quarter isone in which we may end up with more GNP growth than 6.3 percent. Iwouldn't worry too much about that, but I would worry a lot if growthin 1984 didn't slow down to somewhere close to the 4-1/2 percent or sorate the staff is forecasting. One can make a strong argument, basedon past cyclical performance, that we're going to get a lot lessthrust from those two areas that typically lead the recovery--housingand inventories. What we don't know at this point is the degree ofstrength that is developing in the business fixed investment area,which tends to replace the strength that comes along from housing andinventories in the first year of recovery. We're in a very difficultposition, I think, in trying to predict that because the investmentintentions surveys that we used to depend on so heavily have becomealmost totally worthless. The two private surveys we have gotten nowfor 1984 are predicting increases in nominal terms of between 9-1/2and 11 percent. And the staff has said, quite properly, that thosenumbers can't possibly be right; a lot more has happened. The otherkinds of information that we've tended to use are the contracts andorders figures, and they show simply enormous strength. The contractsand orders figures in September in real terms are up at a 25 percentannual rate [from] the fourth quarter of 1982. The problem withforecasting from those figures is that they carry for about a quarteror maybe two quarters but not much further. The staff's forecast forbusiness fixed investment is reasonably strong for next year but itshows a progressive slowdown in the rates of increase from what we'vehad recently--from a 15 percent annual rate in third quarter of 1983to 13 to 11 to basically 9 percent. And if that doesn't happen and weget something more toward the upward end--in the 10 to 15 percentrange--then we have a lot more growth ahead of us than we've allowedfor.The other reason I think we ought to ask ourselves whetherpast cyclical patterns of slowdown in the second year are going toemerge is the policy assumption the staff is using on the monetaryside. It is true that we've had a very, very substantial slowdown inthe growth of the monetary aggregates, but we've also had a verysubstantial turnaround in the performance of velocity. The staffhere--and there are many other economists who have been doing the samething--have been using what we call effective money growth or whatother economists call adjusted money growth. I have been looking atsome of the numbers. What you do is ask yourself what would havehappened to the money stock if the relationship between money and GNPand interest rates had been what it was prior to 1974. Now, that's awild kind of thing to have to do, but it yields some interestingresults. What it says is that effective money growth in the firstthree quarters of this year was about 6-3/4 to 7 percent at an annual-45-11/14-15/83rate, about 5 percentage points below the actual figures. And in thefourth quarter it's going to be reversed; it's going to be about 8-1/2percent at an annual rate, about 5 percentage points [above] thegrowth forecast by the staff. Next year the staff forecast assumesthat 7 percent is appropriate; but if we translate that to effectivemoney growth, it comes out to 8 percent. And that means, if youbelieve the staff's forecast for real money growth, that Ml isincreasing at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate next year. That is very,very high by historical standards. On the fiscal side, I would remindyou that we still have a lot of fiscal spending ahead of us. The fullemployment deficit, based on the 6 percent unemployment ratecalculation, went from a $10 to $15 billion range in the first half of1981 to a $65 to $70 billion range in the first half of 1983. It goesup to a range of $115 to $120 billion in the first half of 1984 and to$125 to $130 billion in the last half of next year. I have to figure,with that kind of fiscal stimulus and monetary expansion stillproceeding quite rapidly, that the chances of an overrun of thestaff's forecast for next year are very substantial", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, New York real estate is still[unintelligible]. To the extent that people are looking around for aninflation hedge, the collectibles market has picked up quite rapidlyin the last two months; much higher prices are being bid at auctionhouses. It's almost as though people are thinking in the inflationaryhedge terms we saw a couple of years ago. I can't understand whythere is such a rapid rise in prices at the better end of the scale", "-47-11/14-15/83MR. BALLES. Well, Mr. Chairman, I continue to be impressedby the differences in the strength of an aggregate like real GNP,which is looking strong, versus the reports I hear around the tableand the conditions I witness in our own District industry by industry.Basically we have both great strengths and great weaknesses. Perhapsthat is what one expects in a recovery that is less than a year old.Certainly, if you disaggregate the economy, you get a markedimpression that things are not going well across the board; somethings are going very well indeed and some things aren't going sowell. It's only in some aggregate sense that the economy iscontinuing to move upward. But I'm beginning to get concerned aboutsome of the distortions that are taking place in some key industries,despite overall growth in employment and production--in areas such asconstruction, trade, finance, services, and so forth. The drop inhousing starts that we had last September of some 15 percent is reallybeginning to feed back into the forest products business now, and therecovery that had taken place in the state of Oregon clearly hasstalled. Unemployment is rising again. In our aerospace business,our country's biggest company has continued to reduce its payroll upuntil very recently. But there is some good news there because theyhave just gotten a heavy inflow of new orders for commercial aircraft.New orders in the last month or so have been greater than all the restof 1983 put together and the backlog of unfilled orders is now rising.And that's, of course, good news for the Pacific Northwest", "MR. BALLES. It's a combination of domestic and foreign inthe commercial field. I'm not talking about the military areas now.The other thing, which is disturbing in the sense of representing somereal distortion in the structure of production in the country, is thatwe have important agricultural economies in the the western region--California, of course, being the country's biggest single agriculturalstate--and I keep hearing many of our directors sing the blues aboutwhat the high value of the dollar is doing to export markets. Thisranges all the way from log exports to Japan to cotton exports comingout of the central valley in California to a good part of the rest ofthe world. So, even though yields on a good many agricultural cropsare reaching new records, the markets for these products are lousy andthat's a direct reflection of the value of the dollar on the exchangemarkets. I think we ought to keep these kinds of things in the backof our minds as we assess the outlook, [knowing] that not all ofreality gets captured in things like real GNP", "MR. RICE. That's somewhat contrary to what John Balles seemsto be observing", "-48-11/14-15/83MR. KICHLINE. I think overall it's a small decline inoutput, but there really is a bad mix problem in terms of somecomponents rising and others declining substantially", "MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, I think the Tenth District issharing the general optimism about the recovery, particularly as it-50-11/14-15/83relates to consumer retail sales. Residential construction has pickedup. For commercial construction, on the other hand, it depends onwhat area of the District one is talking about. The Denver area wasin a boom for a number of years and is well overbuilt, and that's nota very vigorous sector. But if you begin to disaggregate the basicindustries or areas of economic activity in the Tenth District--if youlook at energy, there has been some moderate upturn in the number ofrotary rigs actually working. But it is only modest, even thoughpercentage-wise it looks pretty good. It is maybe 40 percent greaterthan 8 to 10 months ago, but that was a very low base level from whichthey are working up. Mining, on the other hand, particularly coal, isflat. There is certainly no increased activity in the miningindustry. That whole industry hasn't begun to recover yet.Commercial aircraft, which is a very big segment of our economicactivity, is flat on its back, contrary to what John has reportedabout the Northwest. There is no backlog of orders; as a matter offact there are continuing cancellations of commercial jet aircraftorders. The one bright spot is a military contract landed by the LearCompany down in Wichita and in Arizona, but that's just one blip onthe horizon. As for the rest, they are looking at a rather dismaloutlook.With respect to the agricultural sector, you spoke of landprices. As I think most of you around the table know, through thisrecession agricultural land prices fell somewhere between 15 and 21 or22 percent, depending upon whether it was dry or irritigated land.And those prices have not yet turned up. As a matter of fact, thereport that I've had is that there will be some continuation offoreclosure on farmers and ranchers as a result of their not beingable to service their debt. Although there's a good deal of optimismat the moment in the farm area over the PIK program, which has giventhem a cash flow so that some of them can service their debt, I thinkthe observation is correct that without some improvement in the exportmarket, there isn't a great deal of hope for substantial improvementin the period ahead.As to unemployment, it has been decreasing; one of theprincipal reasons is auto assembly, which is a fairly large segment ofour economic activity. Auto plants have put people back to work andas a result the unemployment rates have dropped dramatically inMissouri, as has been observed by Ted Roberts, as well as in Oklahomawhere there are auto assembly plants. With regard to the mainstreammerchant in the agricultural area, it's a mixed bag. In theagricultural chemical area, they have had a very good fall season andlook forward to a good spring. On the other hand, for the farmequipment manufacturers there's nothing going on in sales. It'sobvious that the ranchers or farmers are just not buying anyadditional equipment; they are not making any capital expenditures.They're just sitting and waiting to see what will happen. So, insummary, it seems to me that we're enjoying the benefits and theoptimism of the consumer but the underlying support in the TenthDistrict isn't all that great", "MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix", "[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I guess as Mr. Axilrod carefullyexplained to us, we have somewhat conflicting feelings and signals of-52-11/14-15/83great ebullience and some [concern] about the economy. I just had Mr.Kichline check, and you have to look fairly hard among past recoveriesto find three consecutive quarters [of growth] as high as [we havenow], including the projection for the fourth quarter. Interestinglyenough, 1958 was a bit more rapid and immediately terminated afterthree rapid quarters", "MR. BALLES. Well, I guess I'll take on the role of theschool of contrary thinking for about the third month in a row, justso we don't get too complacent. What I'm referring to, Mr. Chairman,is the move we made--with which I agreed at the time and which we allknow about--to deemphasize Ml and to pay more attention to the broaderaggregates. There was good reason for doing that. We also said toourselves, I think [the record] will show, that when and if Ml beganto behave more normally again, particularly in terms of velocity, wewould reconsider whether more emphasis ought to be put on it. Acouple of months ago--specifically in August--I circulated a paperthat had a couple of key conclusions. One was that the broaderaggregates, M2 and M3, looked to us to be highly unreliable as aforecaster of income, prices, or anything else for the last couple ofyears. Ml admittedly wasn't perfect but it was a lot better than thealternatives had been in the past, and I expect it will be again inthe future once we get a revival of velocity looking somewhat normal.We were forecasting in our Bank at least that that would happen by theclosing months of this year, and that forecast looks better than evernow. It is pretty much expected--I see similar figures in theBluebook--that we will have a strong rise in velocity of Ml in thefourth quarter. And for that reason I'm again suggesting that we notwait too much longer before putting Ml back as one of the primaryintermediate targets, along the lines it used to be, simply because Ihave such a big distrust of M2 and M3 telling us anything.We went through a big recession and now have a strongrecovery, and we hardly would have noticed it from what happened inthe behavior of those broader aggregates. I recognize your point, Mr.Chairman, that the recent slowdown in Ml has to be viewed against thebackground of the strong growth earlier and the fact that we didrebase in July. Having said that, I'm not sure I'd be comfortablewith seeing another month or two of very low growth in Ml just becauseit seems to be coming back on track in terms of behavior, includingvelocity behavior now. Our San Francisco money market model would notsuggest any major move and I too am against a major move in policy atthis time. But I would suggest a modest move toward nudging thatfunds rate down at least 50 basis points in order to get a littlestronger Ml growth in the remaining months of this year and bring itby December at least a little closer to the midpoint--though it wouldstill be under the midpoint--of that 5 to 9 percent range. Frankly,I'm skeptical about whether we're going to get the 7-1/2 percentgrowth in November-December mentioned in the Bluebook, given therecent level of the federal funds rate. So, in a word, I would be infavor of moving toward the specifications of alternative A in order toaccomplish what I just outlined", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But I shudder to think of what wouldhave happened to the economy if we had followed Ml on its crazy turnsin the last year", "MR. WALLACE. Mr. Chairman, if I may be permitted a somewhatdifferent view: I come out very supportive of the position thatGovernor Wallich just expressed, although I think that perhaps somemove is called for. It is becoming increasingly clear that therecovery is more robust than we expected earlier, and I think thatcombined with the prospects of continued high deficits will put upwardpressure on interest rates, notwithstanding Secretary Regan'sposition. I think we will see increased inflationary pressures. AsGovernor Partee has observed, inventory building is going to continue;the inventory/sales ratio is low; corporate retained earnings areceasing to be a factor holding rates down. So, I'm inclined to-56-11/14-15/83believe that the best thing that we can do now is to let the fundsrate move up closer to the 10 percent level and send a signal to themarket that we continue to be concerned about future inflation.Therefore, I would come out in favor of a \"B-\" position or \"B\" perhapswith a higher borrowing assumption that would carry a clear indicationthat we would like to see the funds rate move higher. I might addparenthetically that my preference would be to see the record statedin terms of that rate. But knowing that that's not an option we have,I would opt for \"B\" or \"B-", "MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, I would favor what I would calla small precautionary move in the direction of firming a little atthis point. What I would have in mind is perhaps letting theborrowing level go up to $750 million or so, or maybe a bit higher,with the funds rate moving from 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent to 9-1/2 to9-3/4 percent, at least for the time being. I say that, of course,primarily because of the way that I'm looking at the economy. Again,if I look at the staff forecast for 1984 fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter, nominal GNP growth is 9 percent--4.3 percent real and 4.9percent inflation. If indeed the risks are on the up side, as I thinkthey are at the moment, it seems to me quite plausible that we may belooking at a situation in 1984 where we will have to try to restrainsomewhat the growth of prices and nominal GNP. Now, when I look atthe specifications that Steve has put together, even though one has totake the numbers with a grain of salt, alternative B growth rates forMl, M2, and M3 basically between October and December range from 7-1/2to 8-1/2 percent, which are still pretty robust numbers. I don'tthink I would care too much if growth came out in that range, but Isure wouldn't want it to come out much higher than that. Thoseconsiderations, in combination with my view of the economy, lead me tobelieve that a small move in the direction of a little precautionaryrestraint right now might prove to be very helpful in the longer run", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to enter a vote foralternative B. One reason is my concern with regard to our leadershipin the world economy and our impact as the world's biggest market forthe less developed countries. Speaking on a domestic basis, though,we are not yet back to a trend line in real GNP, described using thelast decade or 1973 to 1980 or whatever you feel is the appropriateperiod. Things have changed so much, though, in the last few years--financial institutions, financial instruments, business institutionsand the way they're dealing with their unions, and the worldcompetition that has now been vectored into this country. But I thinkany fine-tuning, considering how little we know about our institutionsand their financial instruments and how they perform today, would gojust as fine-tuning has always gone--not so fine. So, a slightfirming of interest rates or so-called precautionary firming, giventhe disappearance of Reg Q and given the removal of other estoppelsthat the government had built into the financial system, means that ifwe're going to tighten it has to be, in my not so humble opinion, amajor tightening--not a firming of a 1/4 or 3/8 of a point. And I'mnot prepared to support either a fine-tuning or a major move. Iunderstand most of us are not willing to support a major move. I'dlike to see the status quo and borrowing between $600 and $700million, with emphasis on the lower number", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. On balance, I also come out forstaying as we are, although I do think it's quite possible that nextmonth we will have to give more consideration to a tightening move.In addition to the arguments that have been offered around the tableagainst a move at this point, I would add that a tightening move atthis point really would not be understood in the markets. It would betotally unexpected in the country at large. And I think there would-59-11/14-15/83be a lot of speculation that the Fed is expecting much more inflationnext year, notwithstanding the Chairman's testimony in which he saidit could be 4-1/4 percent or less. I think the only way the countrywould understand a tightening move at this point would be [toconclude] that we privately are expecting significantly higherinflation. Obviously, I'm not saying that that should be the solegoverning consideration, but it does seem to me that, even though onecan make an argument for a precautionary move, the force of thejustification for that might be very much clearer at our next meeting.So, I would vote to stay where we are and for borrowing in the $650million area", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, even though I believe in anactivist monetary policy, I think there are times when the best thingto do is to do nothing. It seems to me that the case that Lyle madeis one which has a reasonably high probability of being right. Ithink we have an environment for a strong surge in capital spendingnext year but the case is not that clear that we ought to be movingright now. One thing that I think we learned from the May 24 decisionof the Committee is that with the new mortgage market we really have avery powerful instrument in monetary policy in that the mortgage ratenow is so responsive to changes in monetary policy. We used to thinkof a six-month lag between a change in policy and the impact in realactivity. What we found when we pushed up interest rates in June isthat we got a decline in new home sales in July, a decline in permitsin August, and a decline in starts in September. The textbook wouldsuggest that we should not expect that prompt a response. I think thereason we got it is that we now have a mortgage market in which thethrift institutions are mortgage bankers; they take in mortgage-60-11/14-15/83packages and sell them in the market. And they have to get a marketrate on them if they're going to sell them. So, that means that afairly modest change in monetary policy can have a pretty big impacton the housing sector pretty fast", " The explanation I heard is thatthe competition among the thrifts has become more intense for mortgagebusiness and they are--MR. PARTEE. That could be true and Frank's point could stillbe right. But I think it is true that we have a very responsivemortgage rate", "MR. MORRIS. I think this is the tool we can use when we getevidence that the capital goods boom is really taking off. I don'tthink the evidence is strong enough yet, so I would argue foralternative B", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If it returns to normal--I don't know ifit's going to; that's a big if. Well, I could convince myself totighten up a little now, although I don't feel that strongly about it.But I'm not sure we will want to wait for the next meeting if theaggregates turn out on the high side and the business news remainsthat good. We can start off where we are and stay there if everything-63-11/14-15/83goes according to the forecast. If the aggregates or the economy comein more strongly, obviously, we have room in these directives to moveanyway. I think we ought to discuss how to bias this a bit, if wewant to. I don't know that it takes any change in the wording. Whatdoes the [current] directive say. Maybe we should start out by saying\"maintain the existing [degree of reserve restraint].\" And if webelieve what the staff tells us, that 8-1/2 percent [for growth in M2and M3] can remain, I think. We're in a mid-quarter meeting; I don'tsee any necessity [to change] the second sentence. The third sentencemay be a question. Let me just look at it", "MR. PARTEE. Zero is a lot less than \"C", "MR. ROBERTS. That should imply tightening, while inactuality we're loosening if we accomplish this. A 5 to 6 percentgrowth gives you 7-1/2 percent October to December, and we've beensaying 7 percent from another period. Now if we say 5 to 6 percent,it sounds like less but it's really more", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, are we putting the 6 to 10 percent[funds rate range] down at the bottom", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's the best estimate, which might becalled a big fat guess", "MR. AXILROD"], "1983FOMC19831220meeting.txt": ["MR. GRAMLEY. One problem I had with the analysis is that itseems to imply that we're looking at Ml as our principal target. WhatI'm wondering is: What do we do in a world of CRR if we're continuingto target primarily on M2. It seems to me that we ought to have ananalysis of that. If we [use Ml], we would be changing our operatingtechniques in that event", "MR. BALLES. That's a good point, Chuck. I would ask thequestion: If we went back to the approximately equal [weight]scenario that we had some years ago, that would not take care of allof the problems we're raising, would it. It might take care of what--half", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I was not terribly sympathetic with theprocedures we followed from October '79 to October '82 in the firstplace and I haven't looked back on that period with any differentview. I'm even more reluctant to see us go in that direction now byelevating Ml even partially toward an intermediate target or byincreasing automaticity. That's not just a matter of week-to-week orday-to-day or even month-to-month variability in the funds rate thatwe would be looking at, but it's the fact that we're looking atrelationships between Ml and GNP since the fourth quarter of 1981 thatsimply have no parallel in prior history. To make it very simple, letme take the past several months. The staff has been anticipating asubstantial increase in the growth rate of Ml, as I have, because wehave such a strong economy. It hasn't happened. If we had had thekind of operating techniques that we did earlier and they wereaugmented by CRR, we would have experienced in the past couple ofmonths a very substantial decline in interest rates. And from myreading of the economy, we need a decline in interest rates and astimulus to economy activity to go with the fiscal stimulus like weneed holes in our heads. In my judgment, we're looking at a verystrong economy--an economy in which the risks are too much expansion,rather than too little, and more inflationary pressures. I recognizethat not everybody agrees with that, but that's my view. And that'swhy I would be very, very reluctant to see us go back to an automaticresponse pattern and the use of Ml as an intermediate target now", "MR. CORRIGAN. Well, as almost everybody knows, I was neverpersuaded by the case for CRR to begin with and I'm still not. Inever thought it would make that much difference in terms of how wellwe could control Ml even if we decided that we wanted to control M1and nothing else. I do agree with Mr. Boehne's point, however, thatthe logically prior decision here is what we want to do with Ml. Butquite apart from that, I must say that my hunch is that we're going toend up with more [interest rate] variability than Steve and Peter seemto expect. That's just my hunch; I can't prove it either, but I thinkthat's the way things are going to go--that we're going to have morenoise and little or no improvement in the control of Ml. So, if Ireally had my druthers, I'd drop the whole thing. But I don't thinkwe can do that. I think it does argue, though, for what I would calla \"go slow approach,\" particularly for the first few months. I havealways liked a degree of automaticity but I would be willing tocompromise that in the interest of trying to get this in place in anorderly way. I suspect that the full impact on data flows and on theoperations of cash managers of big banks and small banks has not beenfully digested in spite of the enormous amount of work that has beengoing on around the Federal Reserve in trying to get people up tospeed on this. In short, I don't think the operational impact eitheron us or on the banks has been fully digested up to this point. Thatagain would argue, in my way of thinking, for a go slow approach. Asfar as our own operations are concerned, I must say that I did notwalk away from reading the memo with a great deal of confidence thatwe know what we should do ourselves, much less that we know how thebanks will respond to what we do. Maybe I missed something but thebottom line is that I'm distinctly uneasy about the whole thing", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think it is analytically correctthat we went out and bought a potato digger but we don't have to plantthe potatoes", "MS. TEETERS. As you well know, I objected to CRR all the wayalong and I associate myself with reservations about Ml as a majortarget in policy and about its relevance to GNP. But I'm moreconcerned that if we go to any degree of automaticity, we're going toget increasing volatility in the interest rates. Can you give us someestimates, Steve. If we go to 10, 20, 25, or 50 percent automaticity,what degree of volatility will we reintroduce into the interest ratestructure", "MR. AXILROD. Yes, and changes that we hadn't allowed for; wewere estimating but we missed. And that will either add to that $2billion or subtract from it; they could be offsetting. To the degreethat it adds, there is going to be a result in the relation in freereserves or nonborrowed--they are the same--that is different fromwhat we were aiming at. That's a kind of noise in the system, I wouldsay. The additional noise is how banks decide to manage theirreserves over a two-week period. If they suddenly get it into theirheads that the funds rate is going down when it isn't, they are goingto get themselves into a deep hole and at the end of the statementweek they are going to have to borrow a lot. Over a 14-day periodthey might have to borrow, instead of $3 billion on the [last] day, $6or $7 billion. That will put a lot more pressure on the funds ratethan they have been used to. So, over a two-week period there is alittle more capacity for noise, depending on how banks manage theirreserves and what [rate] expectations they have for one reason oranother", "MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm one of those whonever really understood completely how CRR was going to give us moreprecision with respect to the monetary aggregates. But that's waterover the dam, as other people have said, and I think we have to goforward with the program. But I think there's going to be an awfullot of confusion out there right up until February 1st, particularlyamong the smaller and medium-size banks. That confusion is going toreign supreme for some weeks after we introduce this system. So, Idon't think we ought to go in any way to any automaticity at thispoint. I would much prefer to see us go slowly. Automaticity has acertain amount of logical appeal, but I think the timing is wrong interms of the implementation of CRR. The other point that I reallywould like to make--and perhaps this also has been said--is that Idon't think we ought to be looking at the question of CRR'srelationship to Ml. The question ought to be asked the other wayaround. The threshold question it seems to me is: What target doesthe Committee really want to focus on. We ought not to be pushed intoone or the other because of a technical accounting system. And I-13-12/19-20/83happen to think at this point in my membership on this Committee thatM1 is a pretty good target and one that has a pretty good relationshipto GNP. Others have argued that around the table before. But it's aquestion that we now have an opportunity to look at in great depth andI think we ought to seize the opportunity before CRR becomes effectiveto zero in on what we really want to target on", "MR. BALLES. I guess I'll resist the temptation of asking,Mr. Chairman, why we decided to go back to CRR in view of all of this.But passing beyond that, first I'd like to associate myself with theview that Ed Boehne expressed so well: Just because we have CRRdoesn't mean we necessarily should revert to Ml as the primaryintermediate target. However, I consider it personally a ratherfortunate piece of timing in that I'm convinced--as some others arearound the table, though many are not--that we are in the process ofwitnessing a new behavior of Ml where it's going to be more reliable.We're beyond that stage where velocity dropped in that unprecedentedmanner in '82 or early '83 and, therefore, we now can begin to relymore on Ml, as we used to do. If that's the case, and it happens thatit has come along just at a time when we could have some automaticityin Ml--not complete in my view--then some automaticity would not bedamaging; it probably would be desirable. I wouldn't want, as SiKeehn said--I think it was you, Si--to go fully automatic. But Ithink it's time we went partly that way. I come out, bottom line, inmuch the same way as Si Keehn and Ted Roberts and Bob Black did", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I join those of our colleagues whohave been accepting the hypothesis that we will have more volatilityin short-term rates, perhaps spilling over into long-term rates, by acloser adherence to M1 targeting, or by CRR. And if indeed there isto be some degree of increased volatility as a result of our moving inthat direction, it seems to me that the risks in 1984 and in 1985should be kept in mind and would mitigate against our moving in thatdirection. I'm thinking, of course, of the international debtsituation, of the efficacy of business fixed investment as asustaining force in the expansion, of housing, and obviously ofcommercial construction, which I think is going to be the next REITdisaster and which is susceptible to the influence of [interest]rates. It seems to me that there is some potential reward, but it'srather a paper reward, of controlling M1 better. But how long is itgoing to take us to learn what velocity is going to be and what trendline is going to emerge--either the old one or a new one. How long isit going to be before we can see what the relationship of this new oneis with regard to the economy. I think we may, as a group, have amore favorable look at M1 and at a more automatic procedure later. Iam sure that many in the markets will continue to feel, surmise,believe in, or have faith in M1 and its close relationship witheconomic activity. As long as that belief is out there, it'ssomething we have to deal with. But now with the unknowns with regardto velocity and M1 and the risks to this economy by increasing thevolatility of interest rates, I simply think we should wait", "MR. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, I agree with you on thatentirely, but I think we've left unsaid here one point that isimportant. And that is: In this interim high-risk period of 6 monthswe've built very wide latitudes on reserve requirements and we'veessentially made the smaller banks immune to the process, which Ithink reduces the risk. It doesn't eliminate it, but it certainlyreduces it", " Yes, it looks much more like a drop to aplateau than--MR. AXILROD. Whereas the other series looks like it wasgoing along strongly and suddenly it dropped to 2 or 3 percent forfour months. It gives a slightly different look to Ml. Up to thatpoint I had been getting prepared to recommend to the Board that wedrop the experimental series, mainly because it wasn't showing anyless volatility. I had the feeling, therefore, that it was justproving that weekly and monthly seasonals are difficult to get at andthat Ml is an inherently volatile series. That's how I wouldinterpret Ml. But now it looks as if the experimental series has madea comeback. It seems to me that it still has some value and I wouldtend to recommend that it be continued, but certainly onlyexperimentally. It hasn't demonstrated--and we haven't found--a wayto make the weekly seasonal variation less", "MR. CORRIGAN. They own the retail outlets in some cases, soit's a mix of both their own retail outlets and their supplies toretailers. I think it's fair to say that in one way or another everyone of these CEOs reported building price pressures. The good news isthat they all at least indicated that they were holding the line ontheir wage cost [increases] for 1984--other than a bank, whichwouldn't surprise you. Other than a bank, every one of these roughlytwenty or so firms reported that their plans were for compensation in1984 [to rise by] 4 to 5 percent or less. They also reported, againalmost without exception, very severely depleted inventories either intheir raw materials or, in the case of those in retailing, in items onthe shelves. Perhaps most disturbing of all to me: There was a trulyuniversal expectation among these people that we would have sharplyhigher inflation and interest rates by the end of 1984. Believe it ornot, some of these people even spoke in terms of a \"buy now\" attitudecreeping back into the picture for fear of the outlook toward the endof 1984. That was my rather clear impression, with the exception ofthe wage side, which would suggest that the risks for both the economyand inflation are very much on the up side. There was deep concern,even among the people in this group whom I know to be very close tothe current Administration, that the deficit situation is totally outof control--that there is no prospect whatsoever for being able to-19-12/19-20/83deal with it in the near term or the long term. Again, at least amongthis group, there was a sense that it was just very, very [important]that the Federal Reserve do what it could to hold the line.Abstracting from those comments, I still obviously feelpersonally that the risks are on the up side in the economy. We knowexports are a soft spot and there certainly is, I think, morefinancial vulnerability out there than meets the eye. I don't thinkthat problem is behind us by any means. But the thing that gives methe greatest cause for concern right now is that I can't quite figureout for myself what really is happening with inflation. In the lastsix months the rate of increase in the consumer price index hasdoubled--more than doubled. It is now running at 5 percent or alittle better, and I can't see that there is any great influence ofspecial factors in there. Maybe Mr. Kichline knows something that Idon't know, but I can't find them. I don't think that the markets ingeneral have quite caught up with the fact that the consumer priceindex now seems to be rising at a rate of 5 percent or a little more.On the other side, we haven't seen any pickup in the deflator; andcertainly wholesale prices continue to look very good. One of thethings that I look at myself as a barometer of price pressures is thespread between the rise in the GNP deflator and the behavior of unitlabor costs in the economy as a whole. Very seldom does that spreadexceed 2 percent and it's unprecedented for it to exceed 2 percent inthe early stages of the recovery. But we're looking at a spread ofsomething like 3-1/2 percent, which I would interpret as a greatdesire on the part of businesses to make themselves whole from therecession or to get themselves whole [before] the recession they thinkis going to come in 1985. The bottom line, from my perspective, isthat we may already be seeing a build-up in price pressures in theeconomy that if carried forward in 1984 would be very, verydisturbing. That's about what I think, Mr. Chairman", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, as far as the Board staff'sforecast, we would not have a whole lot of difference in views. Interms of the risk: If it's wrong, it's probably a bit wrong on thedown side; I think the economy is possibly a little stronger than thestaff has indicated. I'm hearing much of what Jerry is hearing; theredoes seem to be a real concern about the possibility of inflationreaccelerating if the pressures are not already there. Looking at itfrom our part of the country, it still is a bit of a mixed bag. Weare getting strength now from some of the areas that had been slowcoming back [from the recession]. Of course, housing has been one ofthe strong factors [in the expansion] and that is levelling off. Andthat is a good sign because I think we had gotten ourselves into anoverbuilt and risky situation in terms of the land boom. I know thishas been commented on before, but it is still is going on. Thenewspaper has been running a series of articles on what is apparentlya real scandal involving condominiums. [Developers] built over 5,000condominiums in just one little area out by a lake but increased[prices] 600 percent in one day through land clipping. They areselling the condominiums at a rate of 42 units a month, so they have a6- or 7-year supply. The small savings and loans around the statehave been drawn into this. They are very exposed; even the goodoperators--or those who were supposed to be good--seem to be caught upin it. The president of a title company told me--and he sees a lot of-20-12/19-20/83these deals in north Dallas--that he bought a piece of property for$17 million. He was going to close on it a week ago last Friday.Before he closed, he sold it for $34 million and that transaction wasclosed last Friday. I don't know what somebody sees in it that theseller wasn't seeing.On the energy side, drilling in particular is showing alittle strength. In the natural gas area, which has been quite aproblem, there is some feeling that the bubble is about to [burst] andthat maybe by late '84 that will have leveled out a bit. On theagricultural side, by the time one puts together the pluses andminuses it turns out to be a little better than was anticipated.Again, though, it's pretty uneven if you look at our District as awhole. Northern Louisiana and New Mexico are showing a littleimprovement; it's still rather tough out there. On the unemploymentsituation, we're below the national rate, but the state of Texas as awhole has an unemployment rate of 7.4 percent while for Dallas/FortWorth it's 4-1/2 percent and going down. So, my bottom line would bethat there is some strength and that we are seeing some sectorsbeginning to come back that are taking up the decline. In housing, weare anticipating that the financial side will be a concern; of course,our banks and other major institutions are not reporting very goodresults for the fourth quarter and they are making rather substantialloan loss provisions for 1984. There is a lot of concern that 1984 isgoing to be a bit hard, primarily [because of concern] that theturnaround in energy will not occur before the operators, the servicecompanies, and so forth are going to have to [unintelligible]", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, you asked for comments with regardto some of the downside risk aspects of the economy. Let me mentiontwo or three, beginning with the projections we have with regard tocommercial property development in the fixed investment sector.President Boykin mentioned the speculation in land. I want to takethat one step further into the commercial property area where the so-called syndications-- companies and others have sales of$50 million, $100 million, $200 million at a time--have bid up theprices of commercial property and brought on to submarket aftersubmarket a supply of this kind of space, which is having its effecton the existing commercial properties in those submarkets. I believethat the IRS review of so-called tax sheltered investments, if itresults in any kind of substantial change in the tax position of theseinvestors in the syndicates, particularly these privately offeredlimited partnerships, could result in a very substantial contractionof ownership of commercial property and development--the mortgagesthereon--in this country. And I think we're headed for a verysubstantial setback there.As far as housing is concerned, I have never seen in myexperience with mortgage portfolios over more years than I would liketo admit the poor quality that one sees in mortgage portfolios today--if we subject them to any kind of analysis. The builders who havegotten people into these mortgage arrangements and who now havewithdrawn their subsidies--their so-called buydown arrangements--haveleft a situation in which the value, if I may use that term, ofresidential property is no longer rising despite what we see inscattered statistics. And, therefore, the position of those-21-12/19-20/83households as far as payors are concerned is under severe pressure.So, the losses that the private mortgage insurance companies aretaking continue to go [up]; the quality of the residential mortgageportfolio has deteriorated; and there are further losses out there inthe future with regard to these situations.In terms of inventory, I had the opportunity recently, as didPresident Corrigan, to spend some time with business people--retailersin several parts of the country. I take it, Jerry, that you weretalking about manufacturers in the big companies. But the informationI got at the retail level--here I'm shifting from comments on risk tocomments regarding inflation--is that particularly because of theavailability of overseas sources for the retailers, so far they havenot faced the kind of price pressures that you indicated in othersegments of the private sector. Quite the contrary, at this stage ofthe recovery they find that they can get to sources [of supply] andthey don't have to maintain a heavy inventory and have no plans tomaintain a heavy inventory. So, once the Christmas selling season isover, they will have some bare shelves. But some of them are willingto trade off at the margin what they consider minor market sharelosses for the rigid control of their inventory. On the plus side,what I have picked up on these matters has been an emphasis onproductivity--the profitability, say, of the auto companies in theMidwest. They are looking toward break-even points at much much lowerlevels than before, in part because they have taken out of theircosts--as they express it--several billions of dollars.So, it seems to me that we have a downside risk in themortgage market and in the thrift institutions. Savings banks arestill very deeply in the red on an operating basis, despite theinteresting kinds of ways that their accountants let them \"report\" and\"disclose\" to the public. The savings and loan industry--maybe 40percent of it--is still in the red on an operating basis. To add toPresident Boehne's comments with regard to interest rates: Ifinterest rates go up 100 to 150 basis points, that would move theproportion of the thrift industry that is having operating losses tosomething like 75 or 80 percent. Housing doesn't stabilize--allgeneralizations are false including that one--it either goes up orgoes down. And my guess is that it's going to go down because of thequality of mortgage paper and because we have now used up that backlogin demand for housing that resulted from low levels of housing startspreviously. So, I think there are several downside areas in theeconomy", "MR. WALLICH. Mr. Chairman, since you asked us to addressourselves to uncertainties, I see some very critical ones in the wagearea, the dollar area, oil, and developing countries. But even thoughmost of these happen to be risks that fall on the down side, they arenot of a kind that one can guard against by leaning toward the upside. So, I think that the principal risk is really of more inflationthan we anticipate. I agree with Bob Forrestal that these profits arealmost bound to convert themselves into wage increases, particularlylater in the year--September, I think--when we get to the UAWcontract. With productivity gains diminishing quite abruptly earlythis year, capacity utilization diminishing at a surprising rate, andunemployment diminishing at a surprising and a very gratifying rate,all that points in the direction of upward pressure. Now, the otherside is what may or may not happen to the dollar. If the dollarshould go down abruptly, our exports will rise with a considerablelag. Our interest rates will rise very rapidly--not necessarilybecause the Fed does something about it but because capital imports-23-12/19-20/83can be seen in advance to be diminishing and the benefit of keepinginterest rates down will disappear--and that could produce aconsiderable downward bias [in the dollar]. The LDC situation,[though] much improved, is still with us. It is still a majoruncertainty. The oil situation I mentioned because people who watchwhat is happening in the Persian Gulf seem to think that the danger ofa closing of the straits [unintelligible] is greater than it has beenin the past. That would [result in] an increase in prices and areduction in economic activity--the same [sort of effect] as [thatfrom] the other oil shocks. That [potential] situation has a very[low] probability but very high risk if it were to occur. On balance,if you add these up, we have a number of risks on the dollar side; wecan't really guard against them by leaning in the other direction.And the danger of wage increases and price increases is one that wecan take into account and should guard against now", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, most of what I wanted to say hasalready been said in one way or another--especially by GovernorWallich. However, my assessment of the downside risks is not quitethe same as his. I'm not quite as guarded in my outlook. It seems tome that activity is likely to continue strong over the next year,particularly in the first half of the year, and to decelerate somewhatin the second half but still expand at an acceptable rate withunemployment continuing to fall. So, I don't see business activityfalling off to unacceptable levels over the period of the next year.I'm a little more optimistic on the inflation outlook than I thinkmost people have expressed. I don't share the same worry with respectto the wage outlook. I think the wage picture is probably still oneof moderation. It's hard to see that profits are going to continue toexpand at such a rate as to weaken the resistance to higher wages andimprove really significantly the bargaining position of labor. So, Iwould expect continued moderation in wage increases. The energypicture looks pretty good and the outlook is for moderate--notrunaway--increases in food prices. So, if there are going to be anystrong inflationary pressures, it's hard for me to see where they aregoing to come from. So, I see the inflation outlook as reasonablyfavorable--pretty much as the staff has forecast. Along with thevulnerabilities listed by Governor Wallich, I would simply emphasize,as others have pointed out, that the major vulnerability is higherinterest rates than we now expect--that is, higher than in theforecast. A number of people have pointed to that, and I think thereis possibly a real danger of interest rates being substantially higherthan they are now forecast. The reasons for that, obviously, are thedeficit, the increase in private credit demands, and the falling offof capital inflows. All of these possibilities would operate towardputting upward pressure on interest rates. And if that happens, Ithink the economy will be very vulnerable and possibly in danger ofsome damage from that development. I don't, however, expect rates toincrease substantially, although I recognize that as a possibilitythat could affect the forecast, as I pointed out. On balance, I wouldsay that the probability is about 50 percent on being able to maintaincurrent levels of interest rates; and if we're able to do that, Ithink [the economy] will be in good shape", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might ask Mr. Kichline to comment on thepoint Mr. Corrigan made earlier, which is the inverse of this profitspoint. Is it true that labor costs are going up much less--orhistorically very little--compared to prices at this stage. You don'thave to address it now unless you want to. We'll turn to GovernorPartee", "MS. TEETERS. But is your assessment of the situation thatgrowth would be lower than the staff projection", "MR. PARTEE. Yes, that it would be lower because a rise inthe saving rate would cut consumption, and consumption would have afeedback effect on business attitudes--considering that they're overlyoptimistic now", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I'm on the opposite side of Chuck. Ithink there are a couple of areas in which the staff forecast islikely to be a bit low on the real side next year. One of them isbusiness fixed investment. I can't demonstrate any evidence of thisother than a gut feeling, I guess. The staff forecast is well abovewhat the surveys of intentions to spend are indicating, but thosesurveys have been practically useless in terms of the trend ofbusiness fixed investment in recent years. Given the kind ofconfidence we hear about and given cash flows, I think we're going tosee more investment next year than the staff has forecast. The secondarea is inventories. I have heard over and over again the story thatJerry Corrigan is telling us--that inventory/sales ratios are soblooming low now that delivery times are lengthening--and I thinkwe're going to see some price reaction to that early on in 1984. Thestaff forecast, incidentally, has a build-up of inventories andinventory investment to what might be called a normative relationshipwith GNP of around 1 percent of GNP. That means, in effect, however,that the inventory/sales ratio shows no improvement whatsoever; itstays at its third-quarter 1983 level, which I think is the lowestinventory/sales ratio ever in terms of GNP. My guess is that if finalsales continue to be fairly strong--and I think they are likely to be--that we're going to see some efforts to build up inventory more thanthe staff has indicated", "MR. ROBERTS. Just a very brief comment, Mr. Chairman: In myexperience with businessmen, they always extrapolate the present and[unintelligible]; for example, it causes them to underestimateinventory/sales ratios because they always assume that sales are goingto continue as [they see] them now. I'll talk tomorrow about leadeffects that we ought to be considering here. I'm not that optimisticabout the economy", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I guess we come out somewhatdifferently. The New York Fed staff's forecast is for stronger growththan in Mr. Kichline's forecast. So much of this is \"iffy\" that Iwon't bother going into the components and how they arrive at theirforecast; they arrive at it, incidentally, with a much higherproductivity guess. I'm particularly impressed, unfortunately, by theincreased talk I hear in the financial markets about risinginflationary expectations. And I hear a lot of it. So, from thatpoint of view, there's a fairly clear implication for some snuggingup, possibly. On the other hand, though, the thing that bothers me isthat the exchange rate is getting to be a looming menace in adifference sense. The higher it keeps going the more precipitouslyit's going to drop when expectations regarding the exchange rate turnaround. It's going to drop at a time when we're nearer capacityutilization and it will have a much bigger inflationary impact. I'mnot even talking about the developing countries burden. I think it'sa real time bomb.So, I am in a quandary as to where these conflicting analyseswould lead one. If one were looking just at the domestic scene, Ithink it would be important to affect the psychology and curb somewhatthese rising inflationary expectations. I don't think that a quarteror a half percentage point is going to bring that much of a change inhousing and the real economy that it is going to slow down themomentum that much, but I think it would have a very salutarypsychological effect. However, I don't know whether it would push theexchange rate up even further. It would be my guess that it would andI just don't know if we can afford to be that asymmetric in ourmonetary policy in regard to exchange rates. When they are fallingprecipitously, we are all willing to tighten monetary policy; whenthey are rising into the stratosphere, we're not prepared toliberalize monetary policy--for reasons I understand, of course, andwith which I sympathize to a large degree. I don't know how to cutthis dilemma. The easy way out would be to say: Let's wait a fewmore weeks until what is happening becomes clear. But Ted Robert'sscenario--even though we don't believe that it's the most likely one--certainly is still in the realm of possibility. I don't think therewould be any chance of a recession, but there could be some slackeningof growth. At the present time we think there is enough momentum thatgrowth probably will be coming in higher than the 4.3 percent; we'rethinking more in terms of 5 percent", "-29-12/19-20/83MR. GUFFEY. With regard to economic activity in the TenthDistrict, I think we've joined the national recovery certainly, withthe exception of two major sectors: agriculture and energy. And bothof those will take much longer to work out. The agriculturalsituation will depend largely, I think, upon some drop of the dollar--if and when that ever occurs--to encourage exports; and energyeverybody knows about. But by and large I think the view ofbusinessmen and market makers in our part of the country is noteuphoric but it is very strong as to the outlook six months or sohence. In talking to those individuals, they are almost consumed withthe federal budget deficit problem and the fact that the FederalReserve is really the only player on the field and that inflationaryexpectations are just under the surface--whether they come fromcorporations and businesses taking the opportunity to try to increasetheir prices and hopefully make them stick or from wage pressures.[The view is] that inflationary expectations could take hold and be areality, particularly in the markets, unless the Federal Reserve isvery visible.In general terms, we would expect the staff forecast to bethe best of all worlds if it could be achieved. But our bestexpectations are that growth will be somewhat faster in the first halfof the year and then slow down toward the latter part of the year.With regard to inflation, our projection would be higher than thestaff's and as a result--this may be ahead of the discussion--Iprobably would join those who say a little snugging up now would serveus well in the future", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But then the consumer price index shouldbe lower but it's not; it's higher", "MR. AXILROD. Yes. If the center of the 5 to 9 percent rangewere where you wanted to start from, I'm not sure what the rate ofgrowth would be. We can calculate it while we're waiting here, but itwould be a higher rate of growth than from where you are now", "-34-12/19-20/83MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I have a lot of problems withthis, as you might surmise. It seems to me that the only range thatwe can have much confidence is going to be predictably related to a 9percent nominal GNP growth is the range for credit. I've been arguingfor a couple of years now that the changed character of M1 means thatits relationship to the nominal GNP is not predictable. And it seemsto me that I have two years of pretty good evidence on my side. Toassume, as apparently is being done here, that we will get a more orless normal return to historical Ml velocity--I hope that turns out tobe the case if that range is adopted--is an act of faith rather thanan assumption with any scientific basis. I think the ranges for M2and M3 are even worse, because the history of the last 25 years showsthat in the second year of expansion on the average M2 and M3 velocitydeclined by 2-1/2 percent. Therefore, if one wanted to have the rangewide enough to finance a 9 percent nominal GNP growth, the upper limitought to be 11-1/2 percent. I'm not persuaded that the staff has madea very strong case to the effect that M2 and M3 velocity are going tobe so much different in '84 than in the past. Also, this year beingan election year, I would hope that we could adopt targets that wewouldn't have to be changing just before the election. We abandonedthe M1 target in mid-1982 and we rebased our Ml target in mid-1983.To do it in mid-1984 might generate the implication that the FederalReserve was changing course for political reasons. So, I think it'smore important this year than in most years that we have somereasonable degree of confidence that the targets we're setting arecompatible with our nominal GNP objective. I don't think we can havethat confidence for these ranges for Ml, M2, and M3", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think we really have twoquestions that we have to address today. The first, of course, iswhich aggregate or aggregates we're going to emphasize. And thesecond is what the numerical ranges for those targets ought to be overthe coming year. As I suspect most of you would think, I stronglyfavor returning to Ml or increasing the emphasis on it. I'd make itthe primary target. It seems reasonable to me to suppose that, giventhe sharp increase in the velocity of Ml in the fourth quarter, theprobability is much greater that the traditional relationship betweenMl and GNP may be resuming. In addition, I think one has to judge Mlagainst the alternatives. And it seems to me that the case for M2 andM3 and almost anything else I can think of is really not as good as itis for Ml, despite the imperfections that Ml obviously has had in thepast. If the Committee does agree to increase the emphasis on Ml,then I think we ought to consider lowering the 8 percent top that wetentatively set for next year. If we approach the target from thestandpoint that the Bluebook does in paragraph 12--the paragraph Stevewas mentioning a while ago--an 8 percent growth at the top, given theprojection of nominal GNP of 9.1 percent from the fourth quarter ofthis year to the fourth quarter of next year, would imply a rise invelocity of only 1 percent. That is not a figure to which I wouldattach a very high degree of probability given the recent resumptionin velocity [growth] of Ml and also the probable absence of anyfurther major changes in the regulatory area. More fundamentally, 8percent seems to me just not really consistent for any long period oftime with our stated objective of dealing over the long run withinflationary problems. So, what I'd really like to do is to knock acouple of points off that. That's probably not going to be acceptableto this group, in which case I would argue that we ought to put thetop maybe at 7 percent, or if we want to be a little devious say 4 to8 percent but that we're just going to use the [lower] half of therange. But I don't like that [latter] approach, really.So far as M2 and M3 are concerned, I could accept keeping thepreliminary ranges where they were set in July, although as Stevepointed out a minute ago and as the Bluebook mentioned, that doesn'treally represent any reduction in the rate of growth in M2 for 1984.So, I think 6 to 9 percent would be a preferable figure and would givea stronger signal to the market of our anti-inflationary resolve.They will look at that and will be aware that if we stick to ourtentative 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range, we really haven't made anyeffort because of the way the base was set. So far as M3 isconcerned, if there are these technical reasons for raising thatrange, which seem plausible to me, then I wouldn't mind having it at6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. For 1985, clearly, the purpose ought to be tocut whatever ranges we adopt still further, in keeping with our oftenstated objective of working down the rate of growth in the aggregates-37-12/19-20/83over the long run. So far as figures are concerned, I think we haveto wait until we decide what we want for 1984 before we try to put any[specific] numbers on that", "MR. CORRIGAN. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would agree that in someways the key question before us now is 1985 rather than 1984. Wecould get lucky and get through 1984 in reasonably good shape, but Ithink the prospects of being able to keep the economy growing on anoninflationary--whatever that means--way in 1985 at this juncturewill be very, very [low] for all the reasons that have been mentionedbefore: the deficit, the likely build-up in business externalfinancing certainly by that time, and at least in my judgment a clearrisk that the inflation rate itself will have broken through the 5percent or higher threshold by the end of 1984. In that setting I dothink that if we were lucky, we could squeeze through 1984 withsomething that might look like the Greenbook forecast. But unlikeothers, I would not be particularly sanguine about that result. Icertainly don't consider it optimal by any stretch of the imagination;indeed, I guess I would argue that if we really want to try to insurethe continuation of a pattern of a growing economy in 1985, the bestthing we could do to produce that result might be to introduce a-38-12/19-20/83little more restraint in 1984. I'm under no illusions about theextent to which any of this can be done, or fine-tuned, but that wouldbe the direction of my thinking.More specifically, in the context of the tentative 1984targets, I am inclined to the view that the upper end of the Ml rangeis too high. As best I can understand the credit aggregate, I thinkthe upper end of that is too high as well. I don't have anyparticular views on M2 or M3, although I certainly would not beallergic to the symmetry in M2 and M3 that I think Mr. Solomonsuggested. There is another question that is laced in and out of allof these, and that's whether we want to do anything in terms of movingin the direction of suggesting through your oratory at least--perhapsa little more directly than we have in the past--that our primary,though by no means exclusive, objectives are more in the areas ofprice and financial stability. I don't know if you're game for thatright now but if we can begin to nudge ourselves in that directionwithout going overboard, I think it could serve the purpose of thisCommittee and the economy very well", "MR. MARTIN. I would have language indicating that, given thetotal spending that seems likely to occur in the absence of remedialaction on fiscal policy, we would find it difficult in the publicinterest to fund all of that spending and that our targets would mostlikely take the form of [lower figures than the actuals in 1984]. Iwouldn't use any numbers, Tony. How do we know what the actual 1984performance is going to be. I was reviewing last year's Bluebook--nooffense intended--and I don't know how in the world we can set numbersfor 1985 when the 1984 actual is likely to be way off the expected", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For 1984", "MR. BOEHNE. Well, I think we are having a lot of discussionabout a world that we would like to see rather than the world thatwe're actually in. The idea of gradual reductions in money [growth]over time that will bring down inflation neatly and avoid recession isa world we wish we were in. In reality we bring inflation downthrough recessions. That's where progress has come in the past and Isuspect that's where it will come in the future. If we're talkingabout further reductions in inflation over the next several years,then I think we're talking about a recession. It's not that we likerecession, but it seems to me that the two go hand in hand. Havingsaid that, I think we still have to be somewhat idealistic and put outthe message of lower growth in the aggregates, but I don't think wereally ought to kid ourselves. As far as the strategy in 1984 isconcerned, I think we ought to continue to look at a number ofvariables and be cautious of any particular one. I think Ml is stilllargely unpredictable and has an unpredictable link with GNP. Somecase can be made that it may not be as unpredictable as it was in1983, but I don't see any evidence that would [warrant] elevating itto the premier status it once had. I think there is some case forgiving it somewhat more equal status but I would prefer to keep it ina monitoring status, largely for tactical reasons. There has beensome weaning of the market from this variable. I don't think it's asmuch of a shrine as it once was and that is helpful in this judgmentalworld that we have for monetary policy. So, I would keep M2 and M3 asthe targets and M1 as a monitoring range.As far as the specific numbers, I don't have a real quarrelwith the specifications that we set in July, although I think Nancy isquite right that M3 grows at 9-1/2 percent whether we like it or notand we simply ought to realize that and at least have 9-1/2 percent bewithin the range. As far as Ml goes, I think a real issue is how muchM1 is like the old M2. To the extent that it is more like the old M2,then I think higher growth rates are more acceptable, so that a rangeof 4 to 8 percent does not disturb me. I think we do have an M1 todaythat looks more like the old M2 with its implications for velocity.Now, I like the idea that has been put forth by several people for1985--that we ought not talk about just one kind of outlook--because Idon't think a [forecast] for 1985 by this group or any other group isworth very much. I think it would be a very good vehicle forunderscoring the importance of doing something about the deficit ornot doing something about the deficit and I would take that as itsmain objective. To have at least a couple of outcomes--one in whichwe get some help from the fiscal side and one in which we don't--Ithink could serve a positive purpose", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, I think the concept of pricestability should be the overriding objective. And having said that, Ithink whatever words we use for 1985 obviously should reflect that. Ialso would not want to use specific numbers. But it does seem to methat the targeting for 1984 comes at a very critical juncture,certainly in terms of credibility. We have said that we will bringinflation down through a gradual reduction in the growth rate ofmoney. In order to solidify that position and make it believable, Iwould be inclined to bring the Ml range down more in line with whatBob Black was suggesting, possibly to 3 to 7 percent. I think thatwould be a very clear signal that we do remain committed. I happen tobe willing to put more emphasis on Ml, and I think it is morebelievable, and thus that it would be positive to do that. I thinkthat [range] would also be consistent with enough [Ml growth] for the9 percent nominal GNP growth. On the M2 range, I would be inclined toshade it down to 6 to 9 percent since the 6-1/2 and 9-1/2 percentdoesn't represent any real reduction. And on M3, I would probably goback to the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent because its growth just always is9-1/2 percent. It seems to me that would give a better picture. ButI would argue very strongly for shading down the Ml target for 1984", " At a minimum it probably will forcemuch more rapid devaluations of the weaker currencies in the EMS. Andit might even make it almost intolerable, depending on the Italian andFrench policies", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, permits did not rise very much. I donot know if this is terribly significant, but the flash GNP will becoming out this afternoon--no, it won't be out until tomorrow. I donot know what it is, but there is a suspicion in other places that it-55-12/19-20/83may be a little higher than our staff has projected. But I do notknow for sure", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not even a very good number in myopinion after it is no longer the flash. Unfortunately, it can beinaccurate in both directions. But it will be a pretty strong memory.I suspect we are getting a little seasonal pressure in themarkets. I think [whether or not] the reserve positions change, onewould expect seasonal pressures from the middle of December probablythrough the end of the year. We [typically] have a very erratic--ormaybe [simply] erratic--money number early in December; nobody knowsquite what is going to happen through the first week or two of Januarywhen we have often had very erratic numbers. This is well reflectedin the quite different signals that our two seasonal adjustmenttechniques provide. In trying to sort all of this out, and just togive you something to aim at: Given the strength of economicactivity--until there's a little more evidence that it is going theother way, if we ever get it--given the nervousness of theinflationary expectations, and given that the latest money supplyfigures look a little higher anyway, I don't find myself in any moodto ease. I am talking about a very short time perspective of severalweeks. Whether one would want to tighten up slightly is debatable, Isuppose. Part of my problem with tightening is that in announcing it,as we inevitably would have to do sooner or later, [the announcement]may exaggerate whatever one's intention was, unless one had a prettystrong intention. I find myself in a position where I think thatmaybe what we can say is that we will maintain the existing degree ofrestraint at least for the time being and if things turn out to be onthe ebullient side, economically and with the aggregates, we couldmake a small tightening move in coming weeks or wait for a little moreevidence. That is the way I would tend to write the directive--in asort of one-sided way", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have just one comment on that. I don'tthink we can aim at the federal funds rate as closely as one quarterof 1 percentage point. We take our chances on that a bit", "MR. FORRESTAL. I came into the meeting feeling prettystrongly that any easing of policy would be a mistake. I have notheard anything in the last two days to change my mind on that score.By the same token, I don't think that any substantial tightening ofpolicy is appropriate. The decision in my mind is whether we have aslight tightening of policy, something implied by \"B\" or \"B-,\" Isuppose one could say. What those numbers are, I am not quite sure.A $700 or $750 million borrowing level probably would be a degree ofsnugging rather than a tightening. I think there is a lot of merit inwhat you said about waiting to see what develops in the next week orso. So, I am happy with \"B\" or something slightly less than \"B,\"moving a bit toward \"C", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, in terms of the strength of theeconomy, I think one could make an argument for some snugging up atthis point in time. I think the evidence in housing is that thatsector has adapted pretty well to the current level of rates. I don'tthink there is room in the economy, given the strength of the capitalgoods sector, for any substantial revival in the strength of housing.But at the same time I could accept alternative B as written or somesnugging up; I don't feel a strong conviction as to which one isright", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me try to clarify my originalposition in the light of all these comments and see whether we can getcloser. I am partly influenced by the fact that it's just Ml that isvery low and if we write into a directive that we want to increaserestraint and have to reverse that very shortly because Ml falls outof bed, it would look peculiar and would be difficult to explain. Imust confess that I have that a little in my mind. These seasonalpressures are convenient in the sense that we're getting a little moreseasonal restraint for a couple of weeks. I think the split we havein the Committee is between [waiting or not waiting]--not necessarilywaiting until we see [the outcome of] collective bargaining agreementsor that kind of thing, which would take some months. But if we reallyget a confirmation of strength in Ml, particularly by early January--let's say December comes out more or less as projected and we getanother Ml bulge at the beginning of January, so that January growthis beginning to look high and we aren't getting any economic news tosuggest anything less than the ebullience we [currently] see--I'dbegin moving in a modest way as early as that. I'm talking [aboutmoving] maybe in the first week or second week in January", "MR. CORRIGAN. On this point about prices: If you go backand look at the 6-month period ending in April, the rise in theconsumer price index with or without food and energy--any way youslice it--is something like 2 percent. In the six months ending inNovember, any way you slice it, it's 5 percent or more. Now, I admitthat the wholesale price index isn't showing the same thing, but theconsumer price index is what gets into social security, otherpensions, cost of living adjustments, wage expectations, and the wholeball of wax. I find it very, very difficult to accept the notion thatthere is no evidence that price increases have started to go up", " Andas the economy continues to get stronger--MR. ROBERTS. I think that is worrying about fighting thelast war. The inflation that we're going to experience here comesfrom things that have happened in the past. If we have a verysluggish Ml series, just because contemporaneously the consumer priceindex is registering a change that reflects past conditions it wouldbe a mistake to react to that, I think", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Maybe the conclusion is that you needan erratic enough policy to eventually bring about a recession thatbrings down the inflation", "MR. WALLICH. If we're going to raise the borrowing, eventhough that number is not published, the text of the directive will-67-12/19-20/83indicate that it is consistent to have some reaction in the fundsrate. It is peculiar to leave it unchanged when the rate is so closeto the top anyway", "MS. TEETERS. And leave out the lesser restraint", "MR.
