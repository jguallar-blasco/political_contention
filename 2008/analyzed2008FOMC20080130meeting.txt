Passage number 1.
 Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting of January 29-30, 2008  January 29, 2008—Afternoon Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Today is the last meeting for our friend and colleague, Bill Poole.  Bill has been here for 81 meetings, 80 as a Reserve Bank president and one as an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  I thought I would read to you the transcript from March 31, 1998, when Bill first joined the table. “Chairman Greenspan.  I especially want to welcome back an old colleague, Bill Poole.  I didn’t realize the last time he sat in this room was 25 years ago.  Mr. Poole.  I was sitting back there along the wall.  Chairman Greenspan.  It has taken you 25 years to move from there to here.  [Laughter]  Mr. Poole.  Baby steps.”  [Laughter]  We’ll have a chance to honor Bill at our farewell luncheon on March 18, at our next meeting, but let’s take this opportunity to thank you for 10 years of service and collegiality.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement about a colleague leaving and a tribute to his years of service.


Passage number 2.
 MR. POOLE.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I came here 10 years ago with a boom.  I’m going out with a pause.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Poole about his personal experience.


Passage number 3.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’ll let Bill have the last word on that.  [Laughter]  Okay.  Today is the first regular meeting of the year.  This is our organizational meeting, so we have some housekeeping things.  Item one, nomination of the Chairman.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is describing a meeting and the nomination of the Chairman, which does not involve any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 4.
 MR. KOHN.  It’s an honor and a privilege to nominate Ben Bernanke to be the Chairman of this Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing admiration and respect for Ben Bernanke, indicating that it is an honor and privilege to nominate him.


Passage number 5.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Second. SEVERAL.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The words "Thank you" and "Second" are unrelated and do not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 6.
   MR. KOHN.  A pregnant pause.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. "A pregnant pause" is a figure of speech that refers to a moment of silence or hesitation, typically used for dramatic effect. It does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 7.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other nominations.  Without objection, thank you very much.  We need a nomination for Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that nominations are needed for the Vice Chairman position.


Passage number 8.
 MR. KOHN.  I can do that, too.  It’s another honor and a privilege to nominate Tim Geithner to be the Vice Chairman of this Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Kohn is expressing his willingness to nominate Tim Geithner as the Vice Chairman of the Committee, which he considers an honor and privilege.


Passage number 9.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 10.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kroszner, is simply expressing a statement or idea.


Passage number 11.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other nominations.  Without objection.  Thank you.  Ms. Danker will read the nominated staff officers for the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply acknowledging that there are other nominations and expressing gratitude to Ms. Danker, who will read the nominated staff officers.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 13.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any questions.  We’ll need a vote.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed.  [No response]  Thank you.   Item two on the agenda:  There are some cosmetic changes to the Committee rules.  Scott Alvarez and Debbie Danker circulated a memorandum.  Are there any questions.  If not, I’ll need a vote in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed.  [No response]  Thank you.   Item three:  We need to select a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account.  I have been informed that New York is again willing to serve.  [Laughter]  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed.  [No response]  Thank you.   We need to select a manager for the System Open Market Account.  Bill Dudley is the incumbent.  Are there other nominations.  Well, if not, in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed.  [No response]  Thank you.  All right.   We turn now to annual authorizations for Desk operations.  Bill circulated a memo that had one revision to the authorization for foreign currency operations.  Are there any questions about that change.  If not, all in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed.  [No response]  Thank you.  There are no changes proposed for the authorization for domestic open market operations, the foreign currency directive, or the procedural instructions with respect to foreign currency operations.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Opposed.  [No response]  Thank you. All right.  We turn now to the business of the meeting.  Let me call on Bill Dudley to give us the Desk report.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 14.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Bill.  Are there questions.  President Poole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a simple exchange of pleasantries and a request for questions. There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 15.
 MR. POOLE.  Bill, could you talk about the role of foreign banking organizations.  What fraction roughly are they responsible for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 16.
 MR. DUDLEY.  We have been very cautious about talking about the role of the foreign banks, but they’re definitely a significant factor.  The best way to look at it is just to look at the New York District, which is taking an overwhelming share of not all but most of these auctions, and most of that is foreign.  Regarding the participation in terms of number of bidders, the split is more even between domestic and foreign; in terms of the actual takedown of dollars, it does skew a bit to the foreign side, but it has been variable.  It is not the same in each auction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 17.
 MR. POOLE.  If I may make a comment about that—I think everyone is aware of my view that the TAF does not change the marginal conditions.  It’s entirely an inframarginal operation.  What it does is to save banks the spread between what their cost of funds otherwise would be and what they get at the TAF.  So it increases bank earnings by that amount.  It seems to me that there is potentially some reputational risk to the Federal Reserve in the long run if a significant share of the benefit is going to foreign banking organizations.  I guess one question that I would pose is, If we think that this information would be terribly sensitive to release, shouldn’t we be careful about whether we continue if the foreign banking organizations are taking a very large fraction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 18.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage is not provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 19.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I have a couple of questions.  I want to start with the issue about foreign banks, though.  Why are we sensitive about talking about foreign banks—I mean, is this a public stance, or is this in the Committee.  The information about the identity of the winning bidders was sent to every Reserve Bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about the sensitivity around discussing foreign banks and inquiring whether the sensitivity is a public stance or something within the Committee.


Passage number 20.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t think we’re particularly sensitive, but I think other central banks would be very sensitive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's opinion about their level of sensitivity compared to other central banks.


Passage number 21.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, these are confidential proceedings—this is a consequential policy matter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 22.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unfortunately, the passage you provided is incomplete. Please provide the complete passage so I can assist you further.


Passage number 23.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Mr. Chairman, if I could.  I think, President Lacker, just one point is that the detailed information on the bidders was sent only to those Reserve Bank presidents and Board members who specifically asked for it, so it was not distributed unilaterally.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Madigan is simply providing additional clarification or information about the distribution of detailed bidder information.


Passage number 24.
 MR. LACKER.  Just the winning bidders.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply stating that there were winning bidders.


Passage number 25.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Yes.  Well, the spreadsheet of bidders.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 26.
 MR. LACKER.  I thought that every Bank, all the discount officers, received the identity of the winning bidders, and the other information about all the bids went only to those who requested it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating what they thought about the distribution of information.


Passage number 27.
 MR. MADIGAN.  That is correct, yes.  The second point I would make is that I do not think there is particular sensitivity about foreign banks but instead sensitivity about taking any chance of identifying who the bidders are at all because of the great concern about avoiding stigma from the TAF.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents two points without any conflicting ideas.


Passage number 28.
 MR. LACKER.  I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the term auction facility.  First, I’d like to hear more from you about what your understanding is of the effects the term auction facility had on the funding market.  The first question under that would be, To your knowledge, were these completely sterilized or just partially sterilized.  Another question would be, For the recipients, were these additional funds that they wouldn’t have otherwise borrowed, or did they displace some other borrowing.  The next question would be, This crowded out something, and if it didn’t change materially the total amount of reserves in the system, some lending ought to be shifted from the recipients to someone else—so what do we know about other spillover effects in the markets.  The focus of our attention probably for data reasons was the LIBOR market, but there was also discussion in December of the term fed funds market.  What do we know about the behavior of that since then.  I’d be interested in your sense of whether bidders were riskier than nonbidders and whether riskier institutions bid more than nonrisky institutions.  We’ve done a bit of empirical analysis—it’s preliminary—but I’d be interested in your folks’ sense of that.  About the foreign institutions, I’m interested in learning about what the advantage was of our lending dollar balances via this mechanism to foreign banks versus the alternative of having them borrow dollar balances from their central bank, perhaps funded by a swap or out of the foreign central bank’s own dollar balances.  Finally—and this is sort of the most important question—how should we evaluate whether this has been a success or not.  To what sort of objective evidence should we look to decide whether we achieved our objectives.  Related to that, can a case be made for ending this facility soon in light of the fact that the LIBOR–OIS spread is now half of what it was in September, when we decided that it had come down enough to shelve the plan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a series of questions to gather information and seek clarification on the effects of the term auction facility.


Passage number 29.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Those are a lot of questions.  [Laughter]  Okay, I’ll take the easy one first.  The TAF is completely sterilized.  For every dollar that goes into the TAF we drain reserves, and we’ve been doing that mainly by redeeming maturing Treasury bills.  Regarding whether these are additional funds to those entities, it is hard to know what they would have done if the TAF facilities hadn’t been available.  This may have funded some assets on their balance sheets that they otherwise would have decided not to fund.  I think it is very difficult to know what that counterfactual is.  It is hard to believe that in the system as a whole it led to a lot of additional funding.  I would be surprised by that, especially given that we did sterilize reserves and didn’t allow expansion of the balance sheet.  In terms of the issue of crowding out, the way I think about the TAF is changing the composition of our balance sheet and changing the composition of the banking system’s balance sheet.  It’s not crowding out.  We are basically supplying Treasury securities by redeeming bills, and then the Treasury issues more bills that the markets want, and we are essentially absorbing collateral from the marketplace that’s hard for them to finance elsewhere.  So it is a change in the composition of the balance sheet.  That’s how I would think of the way it works. In terms of how we should evaluate the success, we don’t know how much was the year-end.  We don’t know how much was monetary policy easing.  But market participants view the TAF as very positive.  I think that, if we were to discontinue it abruptly, they would be unhappy.  There’s no evidence to suggest that the TAF has caused any great harm.  It looks as though the benefits, to my mind, are likely to significantly exceed the costs even though we can’t measure those benefits very accurately.  Regarding the foreign institutions issue—the choice between dollar balances from us versus dollar balances from foreign central banks—I think it was a little more complicated than that because, if I remember how we got to the foreign exchange swaps, they were essentially more or less conditional on our doing the TAF.  They were willing to do the swaps if they could get the auctions in tandem with our term auction facilities.  So my judgment would be that we probably didn’t really have a choice of getting the dollars to those foreign banks through the ECB if we hadn’t done the term auction facility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information and expressing his own thoughts and judgments on the topic.


Passage number 30.
 MR. LACKER.  If I could just follow up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It only mentions someone wanting to follow up on a topic, but there is no indication of conflict or differing opinions.


Passage number 31.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Did I miss any.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage does not contain any conflicting statements or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 32.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, on the last point, that’s a matter of the ECB’s willingness to lend to those institutions.  You’re saying that they would be willing to lend themselves to those institutions only if we did this.  It’s not about the economics of their borrowing from their central bank versus borrowing from us—nothing about the market functioning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by MR. LACKER about the ECB's willingness to lend to certain institutions.


Passage number 33.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I wouldn’t say it’s about their willingness to lend to their institutions.  It’s their sense of what their responsibility is in terms of providing dollar liquidity to their institutions.  To the extent that they could just passively take the dollars and funnel them through this auction process in which their auction was very passive—their auction was essentially a noncompetitive auction that was based off ours—they were willing to do that.  They were less willing to do something in which they were taking responsibility for the problem and saying that they were going to get the dollars and supply them to those banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is explaining the banks' willingness to provide dollar liquidity to their institutions, without any mention of opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 34.
 MR. LACKER.  Do market participants view foreign banking organizations as broadly riskier than comparable-sized institutions based in the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. It is simply asking a question about how market participants perceive foreign banking organizations compared to US-based institutions.


Passage number 35.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, it’s difficult to say.  If you look at credit default swaps, that would say not.  But as President Rosengren and I were talking before the meeting, those credit default swaps may also contain different appetites to recapitalize banks when they get in trouble in the United States versus abroad.  So the one thing that we can probably say with confidence for the period is that there’s more anxiety that things are hidden in certain foreign banks that are probably not as likely to be hidden in U.S. banks.  There’s better disclosure in the United States on a faster and more real-time basis.  The market sense is that there isn’t really the same kind of quarterly disclosure process abroad that happens for U.S. institutions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses the differences in disclosure and transparency between US banks and foreign banks.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 36.
 MS. MOSSER.  May I add one factual comment to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage indicates that Ms. Mosser wants to add a factual comment, suggesting that there might be some disagreement or differing perspectives on the topic at hand.


Passage number 37.
 MR. LACKER.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The word "absolutely" is used to emphasize agreement or confirmation, indicating that there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 38.
 MS. MOSSER.  During the height of the dislocations in December, the fed funds rate overnight was regularly trading substantially higher early in the morning—this happened also in August for a while—either early in the U.S. trading session or before that.  Our understanding from market participants was that the reason for those higher rates in the morning was excess demand from European-based institutions to borrow in the funds market, and when the U.S. institutions became more active later in the day, the funds rate would then go back down to the target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their understanding of the reasons behind the higher rates in the morning and the subsequent decrease later in the day.


Passage number 39.
 MR. LACKER.  Thanks.  Going back to the LIBOR–OIS spread—that was what motivated this.  It has fallen a lot.  The bid-to-cover ratio is falling.  If we try to lend $30 billion three more times, we could get to a point at which we satiate the market in term funds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents observations and hypothetical scenarios without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 40.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, first of all, continuing that $30 billion is not supplying any additional dollars, so we’re just going to be rolling over maturing auctions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement explaining that $30 billion is not supplying any additional dollars, and the speaker is suggesting that they will only be rolling over maturing auctions.


Passage number 41.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, but the bid-to-cover ratio keeps falling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not have any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact that the bid-to-cover ratio is decreasing.


Passage number 42.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Right.  But, second, I would caution you that this last auction was right before an FOMC meeting and that may have diminished the appetite.  We don’t know with certainty, but our supposition is that the demand would have been higher if the auction had been a week later, if that’s how the schedule had fallen.  Third, February might be fine, but March is a quarter-end.  Lastly, the fact is that, while the term funding pressures seem to be better, a lot of other things seem to be worse, and clearly the pressure on bank balance sheets has not diminished at all.  If anything, it has grown more intense.  So to remove this prematurely would be a risk, especially when market participants view this as helpful and it gives them a sense of confidence that the Fed is there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents several cautionary points and highlights potential risks, but there is no opposition or contradiction between the statements.


Passage number 43.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage mentions President Fisher without providing any information about any contention or disagreement related to him.


Passage number 44.
 MR. FISHER.  The questions that President Lacker asked covered one of the questions I wanted to ask.  But as we go down in terms of the number of bidders as we proceed, is the portion that is foreign increasing, relatively speaking.  Do we know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is simply stating that one of his intended questions was already asked by President Lacker and then proceeds to ask another question.


Passage number 45.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I don’t remember any strong sense of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. Mr. Dudley states his lack of memory about a certain feeling but does not express any disagreement or opposition.


Passage number 46.
 MR. LACKER.  It’s decreasing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "It's decreasing" is a factual statement without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 47.
 MR. DUDLEY.  What has happened, as the auction has proceeded, is that people have bid more tightly around where they think it’s going to come, except for a few institutions who just say, “I want the money,” and they bid at very high rates because it’s a single price auction.  You usually see some behavior like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact about the behavior of people at auctions. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 48.
 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the passage. The statement from Mr. Lacker is not conflicting with the statement of the chairman.


Passage number 49.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: There is contention or disagreement present in the passage. However, as there is no specific passage provided, I am unable to give a more specific explanation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 50.
 MR. LACKER.  Foreign banks were $19 billion out of $20 billion at the first auction; $18 billion out of $20 billion at the second auction; and a declining fraction thereafter, President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the declining trend mentioned ("and a declining fraction thereafter"). The decreasing fraction suggests a disagreement or discrepancy between the initial involvement of foreign banks and their subsequent participation in the auctions.


Passage number 51.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a statement expressing gratitude.


Passage number 52.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information present in the passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 53.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Bill, in your remarks, you devoted quite a bit of time to the deteriorating situation in the monolines, the implication being that the risks they may have affect the whole system.  In the normal course, do we have direct contact with them to get any insight beyond what we get through analysts and rating agencies.  I think you said that they are not terribly transparent in terms of asset class and individual securities as to what they really hold.  Have we had any direct dialogue just to inform ourselves as to what the real situation is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The passage suggests that there may be a lack of direct contact and transparency in dealings with the monolines. The speaker questions whether there has been any direct dialogue to understand the true situation. This implies that there may be disagreement or a sense of contention regarding the effectiveness of current communication and transparency methods between the parties involved.


Passage number 54.
 MR. DUDLEY.  I haven’t had much contact with them.  I don’t know if Tim has.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Dudley simply states that he hasn't had much contact with "them" (presumably referring to a certain group of people) and he doesn't know if Tim has had any contact with them either.


Passage number 55.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage only states a title and does not provide any information or indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 56.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "Vice Chairman" does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It simply refers to a position or role within an organization.


Passage number 57.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  We have not been in touch with them directly to get a sense about their risk profile and so forth.  We have had extensive conversations with the New York State Insurance Commissioner, who is the lead supervisor of many of them, but not all of them.  It turns out that office also has very little information, particularly on the stuff that is on the leading edge of concern, which is to whom they sold credit protection and on what.  But it is in the process of trying to remedy that, and we have been giving them a little help in trying to figure out what they need to ask for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It mainly discusses the lack of information and efforts to remedy the situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 58.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Another thing that is not very well known is what their assets consist of.  We have rating buckets, but we don’t know what those ratings actually apply to.  We don’t know who they have reinsurance with.  Some people think that they’re reinsuring each other to an extent or they have reinsurance with subsidiaries that they own so that the insurance is not at arm’s length.  So there’s quite a bit of cloudiness about what their true condition is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that "some people think" that the insurance companies are reinsuring each other or using subsidiaries to avoid arm's length transactions. This indicates differing opinions or perspectives on the true condition of the companies' assets and reinsurance practices.


Passage number 59.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  We have better information on the protection that banks purchased from the monolines—by monoline and by underlying asset—and it is important, of course, to have that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is stating that there is better information available on the protection that banks purchased from the monolines. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this statement.


Passage number 60.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage mentions President Rosengren but does not provide any information about his actions, beliefs, or statements that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 61.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  I would just note with the TAF experience, going back just for a minute, that the Boston financial community has been overwhelmingly supportive.  I don’t know whether you have gotten the same sense when you talk to the financial community in New York, but whether people were bidding or not, they actually thought that it was quite a fruitful exercise.  In terms of the credit default swaps, just looking at some of the institutions that were involved, it seemed as if the U.S. institutions, if you look at individual organizations, may have had much higher credit default swap rates than many of the foreign institutions.  As you noted, many of the foreign institutions were substantially lower than at least a couple of the U.S. ones that were involved, and we obviously thought the U.S. ones were sound, or we wouldn’t have been willing to have them participate.  We should look at the LIBOR rate, but I think we should also look at the Treasury securities market because you don’t have to do as much in open market operations if you’re doing some of it in the TAF, and we’ve had the interest rate on Treasury securities quite low.  So I’m wondering whether, when we think about the analysis, we look not only at things like LIBOR but also at the functioning of the Treasury market, and whether that was actually helped out by this process.  I don’t know if you’ve done any work on that, but it would be of interest to know if that had helped with the better functioning of the Treasury market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and observations about the TAF experience and its impact on the financial community. They also suggest considering the functioning of the Treasury market in the analysis.


Passage number 62.
 MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I think the presumption is very much that it went in the right direction in terms of the Treasury market because basically the Treasury has auctioned off larger weekly one-month, three-month, and six-month bills to replace those that we were redeeming.  So the floating public supply of bills went up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their perspective and reasoning regarding the increase in the floating public supply of bills.


Passage number 63.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without any context or additional information provided. The word "President Poole" alone does not indicate conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 64.
 MR. POOLE.  Very quickly, we should not be surprised that banks like the TAF.  It increases the bank’s profits because of the difference between the funding costs.  The issue is whether the TAF improves the way the markets are functioning, not whether it’s feeding profits into the banks and whether they happen to like it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that banks like the TAF and that it increases their profits. They then shift the focus to a separate issue of whether the TAF actually improves market functioning.


Passage number 65.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not contain enough context to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 66.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "Vice Chairman" is simply a title and does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 67.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I think it’s clear in Bill’s presentation that there’s a very strong case that the TAF, the associated measures by other central banks, and, as important, the commitment and the signal that we would continue the TAF longer than was necessary have been very important to the improvement of market functioning and very important to the improvement and confidence in liquidity and markets going forward.  It is very hard to know how important it has been to that, but I think it has absolutely been very important, and I think it is very important for us to continue it until we can comfortably say it is no longer necessary in this context.  I think we are far from the point that we can claim that.  It was 24 basis points in October, President Lacker, and there are a lot of reasons that we should be expecting to be living with a long period of fragility in markets going forward.  We all debated the merits of this going forward.  There’s a set of good, principled objections to this kind of stuff, and I didn’t expect that those objections would change on the basis of the experience with this thing, and I don’t think we’ve learned anything new about the merits of those objections, except that there’s a very good basis of evidence for suggesting it has been important to the improvement in confidence and market functioning.  One of our jobs is—and I think we’ve been pretty successful in doing it—trying to give some confidence to people that we as the central bank have provided a quality of liquidity insurance more powerful than we can through our classic instruments.  I think it has been very successful in this context.  To take it back prematurely would be damaging to the improvements we’ve achieved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker consistently expresses their belief that the TAF (Term Auction Facility) has been important and successful in improving market functioning and confidence in liquidity. They also express the need to continue the TAF until it is no longer necessary.


Passage number 68.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there any other questions for Bill.  If not, I need a vote to ratify domestic operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for any additional questions and then requesting a vote to ratify domestic operations.


Passage number 69.
 MR. KOHN.  I move that we ratify the operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. Mr. Kohn is simply making a motion to ratify the operations.


Passage number 70.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Objections.  Without objection.  Thank you.  We turn now to the economic situation.  We begin with Dave Reifschneider, whenever you’re ready.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply outlines a transition in the conversation.


Passage number 71.
  The model considers loan and borrower characteristics at origination, subsequent MSA- or state-level house prices and employment fluctuations, interest rates, and “vintage” effects.  As shown to the right, with data for the first three quarters in hand, we estimate that defaults in 2007 about doubled from 2006 and predict that they will climb further in 2008 and stay elevated in 2009.  These estimates imply that 40 percent of the current stock of subprime ARMs will default over the next two years.An important source of uncertainty around our projections is how borrowers will behave if falling house prices push their loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent.  As shown in the first line of the bottom left panel, we estimate that 20 percent of subprime borrowers had a combined loan-to-value ratio of more than 100 percent in the third quarter of last year.  If we assume that national house prices fall about 7 percent over the forecast period, as in the Greenbook, an estimated 44 percent of subprime mortgages would have combined LTVs above 100 percent.  A similar calculation for prime and near-prime mortgages, shown in the second line, indicates that a not-inconsequential share, 15 percent, of these would also be upside-down by the end of 2009.  While prime borrowers likely have other financial assets upon which to draw in the case of job loss or sickness, such high LTVs pose an upside risk to our baseline projection of defaults.  Another source of uncertainty—this one on the positive side of the ledger—is how loan modifications can reduce defaults or loss of a home.  We have limited information, but recent surveys indicate that loan workouts and modifications were modest through the third quarter of last year but likely accelerated in the fourth quarter.  Servicers are strained working on the large number of loans that are delinquent before the first reset.  One survey indicated that servicers assisted about 150,000 subprime borrowers in the third quarter, which would represent about 15 percent of those with past-due accounts, but were not addressing current accounts with an imminent reset.As highlighted in the top panel of your next exhibit, we summarize our projections for credit losses in the next two years for major categories of business and household debt.  These projections rely on the paths for house prices, unemployment, interest rates, and other factors from the Greenbook baseline.  We also present projections based on the Greenbook recession alternative with the additional assumption that national house prices fall 20 percent.  In this alternative scenario, real GDP growth turns negative in 2008, and the unemployment rate rises above 6 percent in 2009.  As shown in the first column of the bottom panel, if we use the loss rates over the past decade or two as a guide to approximate losses under average economic conditions, total losses, line 6, would be projected to be $440 billion over the next two years.  Such losses could be considered what might be expected by lenders of risky debt in the normal conduct of business.  But conditions over the next two years are not expected to be normal, even under the baseline scenario.  As shown in the second column, losses under the Greenbook baseline are expected to be considerably higher than average and total $727 billion, given our outlook for only modest growth.  These losses might not greatly exceed the amounts that investors already have come to expect given signs of slowing activity.  The above-average losses are especially large for residential mortgages, line 1, including those for nonprime mortgages, line 2.  In contrast, losses for consumer credit, line 3, and business debt, line 4, are only a touch higher than normal.  In the alternative scenario, in which business and household conditions worsen further, losses are projected to rise even more, not only for mortgages but also for other debt.  Losses of this dimension would place considerable strains on both households and financial institutions, creating the potential for more-serious negative feedback on aggregate demand and activity than is captured by our standard macroeconomic models.  Nathan will continue our presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily presents projections and estimates based on data and models.


Passage number 72.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  That’s quite a bit of information to digest.  Does anyone have questions for our colleagues.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude and a request for questions from the audience.


Passage number 73.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a couple of questions that are somewhat different.  On the labor front, I’m curious if you could offer some thoughts on how deterioration in the labor market might be coming about—whether or not it would be from the hiring front or the job-destruction front.  As the research literature has evolved over a long time, I think it has moved a bit away from job destruction playing the key role and more toward reductions in hiring.  I wonder how this informs the way you look at the data.  Any insights you have into that would be quite helpful.  Then I wonder if you could just talk a bit more about the interesting memo that was distributed on inflation compensation and the implications for expectations.  As I read it, it seemed to indicate that inflation expectations, if anything, were coming down from the five-year forward but that inflation compensation was higher.  So does that mean that the variance of inflation is higher.  Are people talking about the possibility of disinflation during this period.  I would expect it to come with that type of compensation.  Your thoughts on that would be great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of a speaker asking questions and seeking insights.


Passage number 74.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Do you want me to take that last question, or do you want to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if they should continue answering the previous question or move on to the next one.


Passage number 75.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Well, I could start if you would like.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any content or disagreement. It only states that Mr. Madigan is willing to begin speaking if the other person would like.


Passage number 76.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply gives permission for the other person to proceed with their statement or question.


Passage number 77.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I think the points we are trying to make in that memo regarding inflation compensation were that, first of all, it’s very difficult to make these judgments about what is going on with inflation expectations, inflation risk premiums, and so on; but our best reading of the evidence was that probably inflation expectations have not moved up significantly recently.  We base that on a variety of indicators.  I won’t go through all of them now, but to me the most compelling evidence to support that point is that inflation compensation over the next five years has actually come down over the intermeeting period, and it is a little hard to rationalize why inflation expectations would have risen so far out, whereas in the near term they seem, if anything, to be declining.  Of course, various factors can affect inflation compensation, including relative liquidity and inflation risk premiums, and we certainly don’t want to exaggerate our ability to decompose these changes into these various factors.  It is possible that inflation risk premiums, in particular, have moved up, and some evidence does suggest that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their perspective on inflation expectations based on the evidence and indicators available. They acknowledge that it can be difficult to make accurate judgments about inflation expectations and recognize that various factors can affect inflation compensation.


Passage number 78.
 MR. EVANS.  I neglected to say how interesting that memo was.  The analysis is really very good.  I look forward to seeing more of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses admiration and anticipation for future work.


Passage number 79.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The only thing I would add to Brian’s statement is that I think uncertainty about inflation in the long run could be moving up noticeably without really bringing into play disinflation or something like that.  In other words, you could be more worried about going down to 1½ or 1¼ than you were before—I don’t know—it could be more just as it was in the forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Reifschneider, is simply adding his perspective to Brian's statement, without disagreeing with him.


Passage number 80.
   MR. MISHKIN.  May I have a two-hander on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply asks for a two-hander, which refers to a type of handshake involving both hands.


Passage number 81.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This sentence alone does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It only mentions the name of a person, Governor Mishkin. More context would be needed to determine if there is any contention or disagreement surrounding Governor Mishkin.


Passage number 82.
 MR. MISHKIN.  When you think about what’s going on, it is plausible that it is both up and down.  That’s the key point here.  Because if you also look at the projections, there is a lot more uncertainty about what’s going on in the real side of the economy.  That could mean that inflation could drift down and longer-run inflation expectations could drift down if, in fact, there’s some uncertainty about what the objectives of this Committee are.  On the other hand, we actually did take a very sharp interest rate cut, and that could indicate that the Committee might tolerate somewhat higher inflation.  So even though the action that was related to the big jump in inflation compensation was a cut in interest rates, I think there is a plausible argument that it could be symmetric in terms of increasing uncertainty on both sides.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It presents different points and possibilities related to inflation and the real side of the economy, without contradicting or opposing each other.


Passage number 83.
 MR. EVANS.  That’s what I was focusing on—the mean-preserving nature of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their focus or emphasis on the mean-preserving nature of something. There is no indication of disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 84.
 MR. MISHKIN.  I think it is consistent with your view, but I just wanted to clarify.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Mishkin is seeking clarification and confirming that his understanding aligns with the other person's view.


Passage number 85.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  On job destruction versus a slower pace of new job creation, it’s hard to answer that one.  Some of those patterns have changed over time; and in monitoring labor market developments, we’re trying to keep track of those two elements and that sort of thing.  Whether that would materially change the way we would look at, say, just what payroll employment growth was doing, it would still be one of our main reads coming in.  As to exactly how that worked out behind it, I’m not sure it would make too much of a difference.  I don’t know whether Dave might want to add something to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different aspects of job creation and destruction and stating that it is difficult to determine the impact of these factors on payroll employment growth. The speaker also mentions that they are unsure if their colleague, Dave, has anything additional to add, but this does not indicate disagreement.


Passage number 86.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Obviously, we would be monitoring those developments.  We are monitoring the gross flows in the labor market, and I think to a large extent the slowing that we have seen thus far in employment growth has come more from a slower pace of hiring than it has from an increase in layoffs.  More recently, in the JOLTS data as of November, there has been a significant increase in layoffs and discharges, and there has been some further slowing in hiring.  If we were to truly move into a recession, you would still see a lot of layoffs, and there would be a fair amount of job destruction, so the cyclical aspect would still likely show through pretty strongly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different factors that could contribute to a slowdown in employment growth.


Passage number 87.
 MR. EVANS.  I guess I was thinking that, if you talk to people, you hear more about the job destruction aspect, but you don’t hear quite the same information about hiring, except you might hear more nervousness.  That’s all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans is simply expressing his thoughts and observations about the information he has heard regarding job destruction and hiring.


Passage number 88.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Hiring plans have come off a bit in most of the surveys that we follow, but just a bit—not a lot yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage states that hiring plans have decreased slightly but not significantly, indicating that there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 89.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart, did you have an interjection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The statement is a simple question asked to President Lockhart.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 90.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Yes.  My staff is suspicious that the employment numbers have actually been weaker than the data have shown.  They have been focusing on the birth-death model and the payroll survey is based upon assumptions related to the birth of construction firms, which logically would not be creating jobs in this environment.  Do you have a take on that issue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The staff is suspicious that the employment numbers have been weaker than what the data suggests, particularly questioning the validity of the birth-death model and its assumptions about job creation in the construction sector.


Passage number 91.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Well, if Bill Wascher, who is our expert in this area, wanted to say something, I would certainly let him go ahead and say something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering Bill Wascher an opportunity to speak, suggesting a cooperative and amicable tone.


Passage number 92.
 MR. WASCHER.  Sure.  The birth-death model basically assumes that the cyclical properties of births and deaths are the same as for continuing establishments.  The BLS has only about five years of experience with the birth-death model, so I think it is pretty difficult to judge whether they need to make any additional adjustments in births and deaths, other than the same pattern that occurs in terms of net employment changes in continuing firms.  But without much to go on, they don’t take a very strong stand on whether they do a very good job of picking up the turning points because they don’t have any history on which to base their analysis.  So I think there are reasons to suspect that that is possibly the case, but I don’t think there is any strong evidence that it is, and it is important to note that they do assume some cyclicality in births and deaths in their procedures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering their opinion and discussing the limitations of the birth-death model, but there is no clear indication of disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 93.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I can't provide the information you're looking for.


Passage number 94.
 MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I want to ask you about the projections.  Well, it is more than an exercise now—the projections that we are offering are for real.  What is the message that comes out of the projections—that is, if I am talking to the press or to others and they say, “What do I make of all of this.”  My question to you is, What do you make of all of this.  What is the message for the implications for policy or the implications for anything.  You know, the data don’t really speak for themselves.  We are throwing out a lot of stuff here to the market, and what is the market supposed to make of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question asked by Mr. Poole seeking clarification and guidance on the message and implications of the projections.


Passage number 95.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Well, that is a hard question, actually.  You know, obviously in some sense the numbers at some level do speak for themselves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the question, but there is no conflicting opinion or argument present.


Passage number 96.
 MR. POOLE.  Okay.  What are they telling us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for information.


Passage number 97.
  [Laughter] MR. MADIGAN.  I think they say that the Committee is expecting relatively slow growth in the period immediately ahead but that the economy avoids a recession.  There is some recovery over the subsequent years.  It is not extraordinarily brisk.  It is a fairly gradual recovery in terms of growth.  The unemployment rate moves up a little, as you would expect with a period of growth below trend, but does not get extraordinarily high; and inflation, after coming under some upward pressure of late, gradually edges back down to levels below 2 percent.  I am not sure that I am saying anything terribly enlightening here.  Of course, one point that I should emphasize is that the full summary of economic projections, we hope, gives more texture than I was just able to give to the Committee’s views about the modal outcome and to the Committee’s concerns about the risks to both growth and inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is sharing their interpretation of the Committee's expectations and projections, without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 98.
 MR. POOLE.  The reason I raise the question is that it seems to me very important that we have some interpretation as to what we make of all this and what we want the market to make of all this.  In particular, let’s say the observation that the projections or the risks are weighted to the downside.  You might get some people saying, “Well, if we get some employment reports or others that in fact come in weaker than anticipated, that means that the Committee is on the edge of pulling the trigger to respond to it.”  That might be a possible message that people would take from this.  If that is not the message that we want to convey, then we had better be very careful how we talk about these.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker raises concerns about the interpretation and messaging of the committee's observations and projections. They argue that if the committee's remarks are not carefully worded, some people may interpret weaker employment reports as a signal that the committee is ready to take action. This suggests a disagreement or potential divergence in how the committee's communication should be handled.


Passage number 99.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole, I would just point out that when these are released it will be simultaneous with my testimony to the Congress, and so I will have opportunities to put some context on it at that time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, who is addressing President Poole, mentions that when something is released, they will have the opportunity to provide context during their testimony to Congress. The tone is neutral, and there is no indication of any disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 100.
 MR. POOLE.  I guess my question is directed as much to the Chairman as it is to Brian, which you will answer in the testimony.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the nature of their question and acknowledging that it is intended for both the Chairman and Brian.


Passage number 101.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I will answer in the testimony.  [Laughter]  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a response to a question or statement and includes laughter as a response.


Passage number 102.
 MR. FISHER.  First, I, too, wanted to thank you all for the paper on forward inflation compensation.  I agree with the conclusion that it is difficult.  Especially in times of strained trading conditions, I think that is the conclusion—whether you interpret the outcome the way it was interpreted in the paper or the way I do it more cynically, I think that is the key underlying point.  I thought that was a very valuable, useful paper, and I want to thank you, Governor Mishkin, for commissioning it. My question is to Nathan on your inflation projections.  Reading through the Greenbook—even though the section on the international side is very thin—with the exception of China, where I think we can sell a lot of “Whip Inflation Now” buttons, and of Argentina, where the numbers are rigged, but even in those countries, what I took home was that everybody was surprised on the upside in every country ranging from the advanced countries, as we call them, to Turkey.  Then, if you look at the exhibit 15 that you just presented to us, those numbers are confirmed in the fourth quarter, and then there is a sharp falloff proceeding from there.  You gave us a good analysis of the risk to the foreign outlook in growth, and then you concluded your comment on inflation by saying that we have been wrong before, that there is some upside risk.  So my question is, What are the risks on the inflation side.  Could you elaborate on them, just as you elaborated on the risks to growth in the foreign outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 103.
 MR. SHEETS.  We are happy to hear that there is demand for a bigger international section.  [Laughter]  You had better be careful what you wish for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any clear contention or disagreement. It includes a statement acknowledging that there is demand for a bigger international section, followed by humorous laughter and a cautionary remark to be careful what one wishes for. There is no conflicting viewpoint or disagreement evident.


Passage number 104.
   MR. FISHER.  But I am very serious about this.  Suddenly there is a falloff.  Would you give us a sense of the risk.  It can’t be all one-sided.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is expressing seriousness in his statement and asking for further information regarding the risk involved. There is no indication of opposing viewpoints or disagreement.


Passage number 105.
 MR. SHEETS.  Right.  Just a word of background.  The rationale for the falloff is the expected decline in these commodity prices and the expected slowing of global demand.  Now, thinking about the risks, I am reasonably convinced that global demand is going to slow, which I believe will translate into reduced demand for many of these commodities that have driven up inflation.  However, that says something only about the demand side of these commodity markets.  There is also a lot going on on the supply side.  At the last FOMC meeting, we talked about ethanol and the fact that many of these emerging-market countries are wealthier, that they want to eat better than they used to, that the relative price of energy has risen, and that it takes a lot of energy to raise these crops.  So there are supply factors as well as demand factors at work in driving up these commodity prices.  It is very hard for us to forecast the supply side of these markets.  It is driven by things like weather and geopolitical developments and so on and so forth.  On the commodities, my sense is that demand is going to shift in to some extent.  As long as the supply doesn’t shift in as well, we should be able to see a decline, or at least a slower rate of increase, in these prices.  A very important point here is that, in order to get less of an impetus coming from commodity prices and inflation in these countries, we don’t necessarily need oil prices to come down in level terms.  We just need them to stop going up at such rapid rates.  If we get slower rates of price increases, that will be disinflationary relative to where we have been.  That is how I would characterize the risks around this forecast, mainly on the supply side of these commodity markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the factors that contribute to the increase in commodity prices and the potential risks and effects on inflation. The speaker acknowledges both the demand and supply factors at work and presents their analysis and forecast without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 106.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage simply states that Mr. Fisher is being thanked without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 107.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation:
The phrase "Vice Chairman" does not provide any information or context to determine if there is contention or disagreement. Without any additional information, it is not possible to determine if there is disagreement or contention related to the Vice Chairman.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 108.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Nellie, I have two questions for you.  One is on exhibit 9, where you forecast in the middle right panel the rate of increase in defaults on subprime ARMs.  If you compare that with your reset rate estimate and your house-price assumption or the house-price assumption in the market, I wonder whether that looks a little optimistic.  Can you just say a little more about why, under the baseline scenario, given what has happened to house prices already and what is ahead, you wouldn’t think that would be substantially greater.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning the optimism of the forecasted rate of increase in defaults on subprime ARMs, suggesting that the assumption may be too optimistic given the current and future condition of the housing market.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 109.
 MS. LIANG.  We have revised this forecast up quite a bit since the first time we looked at this maybe in June or August, in part because of lower house prices and tighter credit conditions.  The model requires as inputs defaults and prepayments, and the prepayment rates have been fairly slow but not zero.  The 2006 vintage, as it approaches its first reset, has been that 20 to 25 percent are able to prepay.  They are able to find something.  So we don’t want to assume that none of them will be able to.  The model would approach both of those, so that is the positive side.  The downside is that our forecast, with the national house-price assumption of roughly minus 7 over the forecast period, does imply house-price declines on the order of minus 20 percent a year or more in California, Florida, and some other places.  That does leave the loan-to-value ratio, as I mentioned, pretty high for many borrowers.  We have never had this kind of episode, so we have to make a judgment about the point at which subprime borrowers walk away from their houses.  The current assumption is that at about 140 percent we just say you are out; but it has to be almost an assumption that, if by then you hadn’t defaulted, we would push you out.  So there is an upside.  On the other hand, saying 40 percent of the outstanding stock will default over two years sounds like a big projection as well.  So we tried to balance.  There are risks on both sides, for sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some contention in the passage. The speaker mentions both positive and negative aspects of their forecast, suggesting that there is some disagreement or uncertainty about the outcome. They mention the positive side of the model approaching prepayment rates, but also highlight the negative aspect of significant house price declines. They also mention the assumption of subprime borrowers walking away from their houses at a certain loan-to-value ratio, indicating a judgement call that could be subject to contention. Additionally, the speaker acknowledges the possibility of their projection of 40 percent defaulting being seen as a big projection, indicating potential disagreement or skepticism.


Passage number 110.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you.  My second question is about your projected credit loss, and I apologize if you said this in your introduction.  Are these losses across all holders of that credit risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The second question is simply seeking clarification and apologizing for any potential repetition.


Passage number 111.
 MS. LIANG.  Yes.  We have not distinguished between who is holding the securities—banks or investors—so mortgages would include the 20 percent or so that are commercial banks, and it would also include those held by investors in the primary form.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the inclusion of mortgages held by both commercial banks and investors.


Passage number 112.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  We, being the Fed, know a fair amount about what banks hold.  Do you have a crude estimate of what share of this banks hold, or what share of this would end up being eaten by banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating that the Fed has knowledge about what banks hold, and then poses a question about the estimated share of banks' holdings.


Passage number 113.
 MS. LIANG.  In mortgages, 20 percent is actually probably a pretty good estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Liang, provides an estimate stating that 20 percent is probably a good estimate for mortgages. There is no contradictory or conflicting information mentioned.


Passage number 114.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  For all the credit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. It simply states that someone or something is receiving credit without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 115.
 MS. LIANG.  They have that much of the business sector and that much of the mortgages, so that pretty much covers it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage states a fact about the dominance of a certain group in the business sector and mortgages, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 116.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I am just trying to get at how you interpret this.  So 20 percent of the additional $600 billion relative to normal or relative to bank capital cushions now, is what.  Is it a lot or not so much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 117.
 MS. LIANG.  One issue here is whether you want to do it relative to current capital cushions.  Banks can raise capital.  If they anticipate that they will need to raise capital, they can cut dividends further.  I haven’t done that sort of exercise.  One way to think about this is that the average long-run rate is about 60 basis points on debt; in the Greenbook baseline it runs to about 1 percent, and in the alternative, it gets close to about 1½ percent of debt.  So, it is not outside the realm of history.  It is on the high side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any overt contention or disagreement. It is discussing the issue of whether banks should raise capital and cut dividends, but it does not present conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 118.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  We have had some bad points in history.  I am not trying to force you to give a prediction, but were you reassured by this or troubled by it, fundamentally, in terms of the capacity of the financial system to absorb it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there have been some negative moments in history and then asks for the listener's personal opinion on whether they were reassured or troubled by those events, specifically regarding the financial system's ability to handle them.


Passage number 119.
 MS. LIANG.  No, I understand.  I think the third alternative gets beyond what most are expecting at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. LIANG expresses her understanding and suggests an alternative that goes beyond expectations.


Passage number 120.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Yes, I would agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The given statement does not provide any specific information or argument, so it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement present. Hence, a definitive answer cannot be given.


Passage number 121.
 MS. LIANG.  In that sense, it does represent a risk that you are going to get dynamic feedback between losses and household spending and lending—it is a high risk.  So I wouldn’t say “comforted.”  I think we were saying that this is beyond probably what our models could respond to in our typical way or it would be another dynamic feedback loop of some sort that we don’t typically adjust for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing concern about a risk and acknowledging the limitations of existing models.


Passage number 122.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.  Oh, I am sorry—a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
Explanation: This passage does not contain any statement or indication of contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the title or role of someone as "President Plosser." The phrase "a two-hander" could refer to a type of performance or activity involving two people, but it does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 123.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a quick followup, this doesn’t include losses from securities.  It is only the loans, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 124.
 MS. LIANG.  The loans could be packaged in securities.  This is debt.  It includes all debt.  Now, whether it is repackaged into an MBS, it would be there.  It wouldn’t be if it got in a CDO or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that loans could be packaged into securities, which may include all types of debt. They also clarify that if the debt is repackaged into a mortgage-backed security (MBS), it would be included. However, if it becomes a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) or something else, it would not be included.


Passage number 125.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Just in corporate bonds, for example.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about corporate bonds.


Passage number 126.
 MS. LIANG.  Yes.  It includes corporate bonds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any form of disagreement or contention. It simply states that corporate bonds are included.


Passage number 127.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply expressing gratitude for something.


Passage number 128.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage only mentions the name "President Plosser" and does not provide any context or information that could indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 129.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have three questions.  Let me go to Brian first.  This is more of a comment.  In your description of the forecast, you referred several times to the notion that there might be slack in the economy in 2010 based on these numbers.  I guess my reaction to that, while I was kind of skeptical, I am not sure exactly how you infer that from what was reported.  Certainly, that seems to be true in the Greenbook forecast, but trend growth seems to be as good as or better than it was in the last projection.  In 2010, inflation—true—is a little higher.  The unemployment rate may be a 0.1 or 0.2 percentage point higher.  But unless you infer something about what people thought the NAIRU might be, I don’t know how you would necessarily infer that the reason inflation went up in these forecasts was that there was slack in the economy in these projections.  So I just wanted to caution about the language we use in how we describe what we see here without necessarily inferring something about whether, in any individual person’s forecast, there may or may not have been slack.  In mine, there wasn’t in 2010, but I don’t see that necessarily follows from what these numbers look like.  That was my only observation here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser expresses skepticism and disagrees with how Brian inferred the presence of slack in the economy in 2010 based on the reported numbers. He cautions against inferring that there is slack without considering individual forecasts and their reasoning.


Passage number 130.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Maybe I can respond to that.  It is very inferential, and it is based partly on the two-tenths’ difference from the October exercise when it was actually clear—I think clearer at that time—from participants’ forecasts that many participants characterized their NAIRU as being in the vicinity of 4¾ percent.  Unfortunately, the writeups this time were not all that explicit on this point, but it is the comparison with October that I was leaning on fairly heavily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Madigan is simply providing an explanation for his statement, based on the information available to him.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 131.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I have two other questions that I would like to pose.  One is the change in the Greenbook’s assumption about the increase in potential GDP.  In particular, I am curious because what it essentially does, it seems, is to build in a significant amount of slack or output gap in 2009 and 2010 that didn’t exist in the last Greenbook.  I am inferring that part of the reason the more-aggressive easing in the policy assumption does not have any effect on inflation to speak of is that it is offset by the increased gap that you have built in.  So I would like a little more explanation about the justification for building in a greater gap or a higher potential.  But I am also curious to know, if you hadn’t done that, what your forecast for growth and inflation would look like in, let’s say, 2009 and 2010.  Could you give some guesstimate of how that might have affected it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is expressing disagreement or skepticism about the change in the Greenbook's assumption about the increase in potential GDP. He questions the justification for building in a greater output gap and higher potential and asks for clarification on the impact it would have on growth and inflation forecasts.


Passage number 132.
   MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  In terms of the rationale for increasing potential going back over history, some of that, as I think I mentioned, was just that actual productivity performance has been better than the last time we reviewed this in the summer, and we are taking that on board.  That is part of the motivation.  Another part of the motivation is what we perceive is a somewhat growing tension between the way we saw labor market slack developing and the way we were looking at slack in terms of the product side through the output gap.  We had arrived at a point this round where those tensions had increased over time, and this revision mitigates some of that tension, so those two things are in better alignment with each other.  We also were taking the opportunity, when we opened up, to look at some other technical factors we used that get involved in going from, say, the nonfarm business sector to GDP, that sort of thing, and those also pushed us in the direction of being a bit more optimistic on growth going back.  So we did view it, if you look at it in terms of product markets, as that there was more slack now than we had previously been thinking and that there was also more slack in the labor market—but that was from the actual data that came in.  Going forward, we have more slack.  We have more slack just in the labor market because we have revised up the unemployment rate.  With that, and taking on board these assumptions of potential output, we have more slack on the output side. Now, one question would be, to address your second question, how would things have changed if we hadn’t taken that on board.  Well, going forward, we would have written down a lower GDP forecast because what we are really saying here is that it is not that households and firms have changed their perceptions; this is just us, the poor econometricians, trying to infer what is out there in the real world.  So the poor econometricians have inferred that potential output is growing stronger.  We have to look at it and say, “Well, so the prospects going forward for permanent incomes, corporate earnings, and that sort of thing, will be stronger, and that implies basically a one-for-one ratcheting up.”  If we had said, “Well, no, potential output growth going forward won’t be stronger,” we would have revised down the GDP growth rate with it, so there wouldn’t have been any change in the output gap from that.  That would have been shifting one for one.  It wouldn’t have changed our sense of what resource utilization would be going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply explains the rationale for increasing potential in terms of productivity performance and the alignment between labor market slack and the output gap. There is no indication of conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 133.
   MR. PLOSSER.  So are you saying that your path of the gap would have been unchanged.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 134.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The path of the gap would have been to a first approximation unchanged going forward.  Some of the greater resource utilization now and going forward is a combination of the fact that we haven’t really changed our view on the labor market, aside from once we took on board the new unemployment rate data, but that we did change on the product market.  Going forward, the way it evolves further on, we see the labor market gap opening up a little more and the output gap opening up a little more—that is driven primarily by our sense that the economy in an underlying sense is weaker—and we have made an adjustment for that with the monetary policy assumption.  But it is not quite enough.  We haven’t lowered the funds rate as much as we would have needed to do to totally wipe out that fact and keep resource utilization constant going forward on the product side.  This is a difficult question.  It was a difficult one for us, definitely, going through it because we had many moving parts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is an evolving gap in the labor market and output, but also admits that their adjustment to monetary policy is not sufficient to completely address the issue. This implies a disagreement or uncertainty about the appropriate course of action to maintain constant resource utilization.


Passage number 135.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Well, it does really change the character of the forecast substantially, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser is expressing his opinion about how a change impacts the forecast, but he is not disagreeing with anyone.


Passage number 136.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  If you think about the forecast as resource utilization and inflation, then it has an effect on resource utilization that is bigger now going forward in the product market.  We also see a bigger effect in the labor market, and if that were the only thing, it would have put more downward pressure—but not a lot—on inflation.  But as I mentioned, we are coming into this forecast with somewhat worse inflation performance lately, and we think that has some persistence.  So that is helping balance it out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining the effects of the forecast on resource utilization, inflation, and the labor market. There is no contradictory information or conflicting viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 137.
 MR. PLOSSER.  My last question is also related to some adjustments that struck me in the panel you talked about where you constructed the revised estimates of r*.  The first item on your list that you talk about was that the equity premium had gone up, and that was a big factor.  So I have a couple of questions.  That was an adjustment factor.  Now, the way I would think about the stock market declining would be primarily having a wealth effect that works its way through consumption—that would be the normal channel.  Yet the Greenbook and this discussion seem to suggest that somehow there was an additional adjustment made because of the rise in the equity premium.  Is that correct or not, or is it just the wealth effect that you are talking about.  Are these separate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows disagreement or contention between Mr. Plosser and the speaker. Mr. Plosser questions the speaker's assertion about the rise in the equity premium as a factor in the stock market decline, suggesting that it may be primarily due to a wealth effect. The speaker's response is not provided in the passage.


Passage number 138.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  No, it is not separate; the equity premium is a large reason that we had the big drop in stock values.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement; it simply states a fact about the equity premium and its impact on stock values.


Passage number 139.
 MR. PLOSSER.  But is the mechanism through a wealth effect on consumption growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is merely asking a clarifying question.


Passage number 140.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Mostly, but not totally.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or arguments. It simply states that there is mostly agreement but not complete agreement.


Passage number 141.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Well, what does that mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only includes a question by Mr. Plosser seeking clarification on a particular point. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 142.
   MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I would say a couple of things.  One, you can think of the cost of raising capital through equity as having some small influence on business investment.  That is pretty small.  The big effect would be primarily on consumption, as you mentioned.  Wealth effects to a smaller extent would affect housing as well.  But I think of that as a wealth channel.  But there is a bit of a cost-of-capital effect through raising funds through equity that you might think of as well.  Another thing I would say is that the difficulty here is distinguishing the equity premium from general risk concerns, risk premiums in general, or increased compensation for higher risk or default risk in a number of these credit spreads we are talking about; those are sort of related.  It is hard to keep these things separate in any kind of an accounting.  Also, these things tend to be correlated with consumer and business sentiment.  Again, that is another thing that is hard to keep separate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 143.
 MR. PLOSSER.  So are these “extra channels”— if you want to call them that—typically part of the forecast change and how you evaluate.  That is to say, in the fall, when the stock market booms 10 percent, are we going to get another kicker upward in r* due to these same factors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking a clarifying question to gain further understanding.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 144.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The use of the word "Yes" suggests that there is contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 145.
  MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  It might not happen.  I mean, you could have a situation in which business sentiment would not take a hit, for example, simultaneously with the stock market tumbling, and you would not see some risk premiums on bonds going up.  That would be very unusual.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply presenting a hypothetical scenario where business sentiment and stock market performance may not align with the usual pattern of risk premiums on bonds going up.


Passage number 146.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I am just reacting to this very large change in your estimate of r* and attributing it to equity premiums, and I was just trying to figure out both.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is simply seeking clarification and trying to understand the reason for the change in estimate of r*.


Passage number 147.
 MR. STOCKTON.  We just had a really big drop in the stock market, and that is the biggest piece of what is going on.  But we have also marked down considerably our housing forecast.  That is in an exogenous shift in aggregate demand, the IS curve.  That is another chunk of what is going on here.  We have had some increase in risk spreads, not just in the equity premium.  Despite the fact that Treasury rates have fallen, corporate bond yields have not as much, and we don’t have as much there, so there is in general a widening of risk premiums.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating different factors contributing to the current situation in the stock market and housing forecast.


Passage number 148.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Well, I am just trying to sort out how much of this is really due to the stock market moving around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Plosser is attempting to understand the extent to which the stock market affects the situation.


Passage number 149.
 MR. STOCKTON.  A big chunk of this is due to the stock market, so I don’t know what we can do other than to take that on board in our forecast.  As Dave noted, there are a few other, small wrinkles, and we didn’t just invent those extra wrinkles this time around.  They have always been there.  But most of this is working through the wealth effect on the consumer spending side.  So it is a weaker stock market and much weaker consumption.  That is the aggregate demand channel.  The other piece is housing, which I don’t want to minimize because, in fact, that is another nontrivial factor holding down demand and, we think, depressing our estimate of the equilibrium funds rate here over the intermediate term.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing various factors that are affecting the economy, such as the stock market and housing.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 150.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I didn’t understand that this was just primarily the wealth effect or whether you were referring to something different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is expressing uncertainty about whether the topic being discussed is solely about the wealth effect or if there is something else being referred to.


Passage number 151.
 MR. STOCKTON.  No, nothing different.  Again, the way the stock market and other elements of spending operate is a little more complicated than just a consumer spending channel, but it really is wealth effect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It merely states a statement made by Mr. Stockton.


Passage number 152.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I wonder if I could entice anybody for a cup of coffee.  [Laughter]  Why don’t we take a fifteen-minute break, and then we’ll commence with the go-round.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing a wonder or a request for a cup of coffee, followed by a suggestion for a break and expressing gratitude.


Passage number 153.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If it is okay with everybody, we can start the economic go-round at this point.  President Poole, you are up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 154.
 MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am not sure how I got to be first here, but I guess I was being unusually agreeable when Debbie asked me.  [Laughter]  The general tenor of comments that I hear from our directors and people around the Eighth Federal Reserve District—these are the community bankers and smaller firms—is that things are slow but not disastrously slow.  The comments that I hear from a series of phone calls to much larger national companies are decidedly more pessimistic, with one exception that I will talk about in a moment.  My contact at a large national trucking firm says that they are in a 20-month recession in transportation.  They are cutting their capacity, cutting the number of trucks, and I think the numbers on their cap-ex illustrate the situation:  for 2006, $410 million; for 2007, $336 million; and their plan for 2008 is $200 million.  That is down a little more than 50 percent in two years, so they are really cutting back.  I also called friends at UPS and FedEx, and generally things are not a whole lot different but a little weaker than they have been.  Neither firm has any particular issues with labor supply.  Domestic express business is flat, and customers are switching to the lower-priced services instead of overnight delivery at the end of the afternoon, shifting to ground services, and that sort of thing.  On international business, U.S.-outbound volume for FedEx is up 6 percent.  That would be consistent with the export increases that we have seen.  Reports are that Asia is a bit slower but is still growing very rapidly.  Asia to the United States is up 80 percent, 20 percent to Europe and Latin America.  The freight market is dead—that is the way my contact put it—down 5 percent year over year.  That is consistent with my trucking industry contact—and pretty much the same with UPS.  My contact with the fast food industry—the quick-serve restaurant, or QSR, business—says the demand there is definitely weak.  They are coming in roughly flat, I guess, or actually down so far this year.  Prices are up because of the increase in food costs.  The casual dining industry is in worse shape than the fast food industry.  My contact also follows retail in general pretty closely and finds that retail business in general is weak.  That is consistent with a lot of the reports that we have been receiving. A major exception is in the IT area—software.  I have contact with a large software company, and the contact noted that, as announced, Microsoft had a fantastic quarter.  The earnings were up sharply.  PC hardware sales are growing at a rate of 11 to 13 percent expected in the first half of this year, so we see strong growth in the PC market.  Consumer demand is stronger than business demand.  Both, however, are pretty strong.  The international business is doing better, in part because the industry is having some success in reducing the amount of software piracy.  The biggest problem is finding software engineers.  This particular company is running 8 percent behind its hiring forecast and cannot find software engineers.  Positive for us old guys; some of the retirees are coming back to write code.  [Laughter]  Thank you.  That is all I have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply presenting different observations and information from various sources.


Passage number 155.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude and addressing President Yellen respectfully.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 156.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I broadly agree with the Greenbook forecast for economic growth this year and with the assessment that the downside risks to that forecast are considerable.  The severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the economy at, if not beyond, the brink of recession.  My forecast incorporates fiscal stimulus of the same magnitude as the Greenbook and monetary stimulus that is somewhat larger.  I have assumed a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and an additional 25 basis point cut during the first half.  My forecast shows growth of 1½ percent in 2008, like the Greenbook, but it has a more pronounced acceleration in 2009 as the monetary and fiscal stimulus kickstarts the economy.  The unemployment rate edges up this year to 5¼ percent before dropping gradually next year toward the natural rate of 4¾.  I am especially concerned about the outlook for consumer spending.  The combined hits to equity and housing wealth will extract a considerable toll, and consumer spending will be further depressed by slower growth in disposable income due to weaker employment growth.  Delinquencies and charge-offs on most forms of consumer debt have already risen, and slower job growth seems likely to exacerbate this trend, prompting financial institutions to further tighten credit standards and terms.  In my forecast, such developments reverberate back negatively onto economic activity. Like the Greenbook, I downgraded my economic outlook substantially since our last in-person meeting.  The December employment report was probably the single most shocking piece of real side news prompting this revision.  But knowing that it is unwise to put too much weight on any single piece of data, I have been examining the question of whether that report was more signal or noise.  The drop in initial UI claims to relatively low levels in recent weeks makes such an assessment important.  Because the behavior of both series may have been affected by seasonal factors near year-end, it seems worthwhile to examine a broad range of data bearing on the labor market.  My conclusion is that the labor market has indeed been weakening since mid-2007, and the extent of weakening, while relatively modest thus far, is quite typical of patterns seen when the economy is tipping into recession. Independent evidence of a weakening in the labor market comes from the household survey.  Even when adjusted for definitional and measurement differences from the payroll survey, the household survey shows a fairly smooth trend of declining employment growth during 2007.  The drop in payroll employment in December helped bring the establishment data into closer alignment with the household employment data.  In the payroll survey, the slowdown is concentrated in construction and finance.  In the household series, higher unemployment is actually widespread across sectors.  The household survey also contains other signs of a weakening job market:  a 25 percent increase in the unemployment rate for job losers, which accounts for the lion’s share of the overall increase in aggregate unemployment; an increase in the number of newly unemployed job losers, which can be thought of as a broader measure than UI claims of inflows into unemployment; and an increase of 5 to 10 percent in the estimated expected completed duration of an unemployment spell, suggesting a reduced pace of outflows from unemployment.  The labor force participation rate of men and women of age 16 to 24 years has also fallen notably in recent months.  Labor force participation rates for this group have been edging down since the last recession, but the decline accelerated in 2007, and historically this group is among the first to respond to weakening labor market conditions. Data from the JOLTS survey, which we discussed in the Q&A round, confirm the weakness revealed elsewhere.  The job openings, or vacancy, rate is down, consistent with the reduced pace of outflows from unemployment, as reflected in continuing UI claims and unemployment durations, and layoffs and discharges are up sharply.  Other data cited in the Greenbook, Part 2, such as net hiring plans for Manpower, and NFIB and survey measures of job availability and unemployment expectations further corroborate a slowdown.  With the aggregate unemployment rate now up only 0.6 percentage point off its low, I would describe the deterioration in the labor market thus far as modest, but it is noteworthy that an increase in unemployment of this magnitude, in the space of 12 months, has occurred only twice since 1948 outside of recessions. While my modal scenario contains a near-term slowdown rather than a contraction, it is actually pretty rosy compared with what I fear might happen.  My contacts have turned decidedly negative in the past six to eight weeks, and further financial turmoil may still ensue.  On consumer spending, two large retailers report very subdued expectations going forward following the weak holiday season, which involved a lot of discounting.  On hiring and capital spending, my contacts have emphasized restraint in their plans due to fears that the economy will continue to slow.  A serious issue is whether the tightening of credit standards that is under way  will deepen into a full-blown credit crunch.  The new Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey shows a noticeable tightening in lending standards, and this is confirmed by my contacts.  For example, senior officers of a large bank in my District recently described a variety of new steps they are taking to protect against credit losses.  They are tightening underwriting practices across the entire consumer lending and small business loan portfolio.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Yellen expresses concern about the outlook for consumer spending and the potential for a credit crunch, while also noting that her forecast is somewhat more positive than what she fears might actually happen.


Passage number 157.
  A recent strategy has involved classifying MSAs according to whether their real estate markets are stable, soft, distressed, or severely distressed, using both historical and prospective views of property values.  Based on these designations, the company has reduced permissible combined loan-to-value ratios in their home equity portfolio, and going forward they intend to apply them across the entire consumer portfolio.  On the positive side, though, they note that lower interest rates have spurred a surge in applications for mortgage refinancing, and a recent analysis shows that the reduction in the prime rate is having a significant impact on ARM reset expectations, shifting a large number from increases to reductions at reset.  In fact, an analysis conducted before our most recent rate cut that assumed a 7 percent prime rate in February 2008—and it is now at 6½—estimates that two-thirds of the subprime ARM portfolio would now experience a decrease in their monthly payments at reset.  This is a sharp contrast from an analysis in June 2007 with a prime rate of 8 percent. Now let me turn briefly to inflation and inflation expectations.  I project that inflation will decline over the forecast period to around 1¾ percent, and I see the risks around that forecast as balanced.  Admittedly, though, the recent data on inflation have been worrisome, and they raise the issue of whether or not we can afford to cut rates as much as needed to fight a recession without seriously risking a persistently higher rate of inflation and inflation expectations.  I tend to think this risk is manageable, largely because of the credibility we have built.  It appears to me that this credibility has reduced the response of inflation to all the factors thought to influence it, including energy prices, the exchange rate, and business cycle conditions.  Thus I consider it less likely that rising energy prices are going to push up core inflation very much or that the pass-through that does occur will easily get built into inflation expectations.  So I view inflation as less persistent now than it once was, tending to revert fairly quickly to the public’s view of our inflation objective.  I do hope that our long-run inflation forecast will help people identify what that objective is.  But even if inflation expectations turn out to be less well anchored than I think, I still see the inflation risk going forward as roughly balanced.  With less well anchored inflation expectations, there is greater risk that higher energy and import prices will pass through into core inflation and inflation expectations.  By the same token, there is also a greater likelihood that inflation will decline should a recession occur.  We looked at the behavior of core and total inflation in the first three years following recessions from 1960 to the last one in 2001, and inflation declined in most of these episodes.  The exception is 2001, when core inflation remained essentially unchanged—which seems consistent with my view that inflation has become less responsive to the business cycle over the past decade or so as we have acquired more credibility.

Passage number 172.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my view, the decision we took on January 21 reflected a broad consensus that economic fundamentals were weakening at a rapid pace in an environment of continuing, even heightened, concern about financial market stress and fragility.  My contacts over this last week in the business and financial markets may add a little texture to the picture on which we based our January 21 policy action.  Conversations with these contacts in various industries provide information generally consistent with a downward revision of the outlook.  Forward-looking sentiment of the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta turned decidedly pessimistic in January.  Retail contacts noted quite disappointing results through mid-January and are taking a conservative approach to 2008 in terms of hiring and inventory.  Regarding the residential construction industry, regional weakness continues and is spreading from coastal markets to interior markets.  In addition, I had a conversation with the CEO of a large public homebuilder of national scope.  He cited historically high contract cancellation rates, especially on the West Coast and the D.C. area, because of the buyers’ difficulty selling existing homes and getting financing.  This limits their market to first-time buyers.  His judgment is that a change in market atmosphere will require inventories falling to around six months.  He pointed out that the spring is traditionally the key season for sales, so the next several months will be particularly telling. Weakness in the region’s commercial real estate market appears to be spreading.  The retail segment is continuing to experience declining leasing activity, and weakness is now emerging in the warehouse and office markets as well.  In partial contrast, reports from the manufacturing sector are more mixed.  Activity remains very weak in housing-related industries.  One CEO, reflecting the concern of others, predicted business failures in lumberyards and construction supply firms because of excess capacity and the slow response to a lower building environment.  The trucking sector continues to slump.  However, industries related to oil and gas production; import-substituting industries, such as steel, aerospace, and defense; and the foreign brand auto sector are all performing quite well.  Atlanta’s national forecast is largely consistent with the Greenbook in direction, and our differences with the Greenbook in magnitude and timing are not material.  Like the Greenbook, we premise our forecast on a lower funds rate at the level of 3 percent. So the principal risk to the forecast in my view is the fragility of the financial markets.  Uncertainty and fear continue to loom large.  I made a number of calls to financial market players, and my counterparts cited a variety of concerns relevant to overall financial stability.  For instance, one of the recent concerns, as Bill Dudley depicted, has been the situation of the monoline credit insurers.  Several of my contacts had comments, but I spoke to the newly appointed interim CEO of one of the two monoline insurance firms most prominent in the news, and he characterized the firm’s solvency and liquidity fundamentals as in question only toward the far end of current independent forecasts of subprime losses.  Perhaps predictably, he contrasted his assessment with what he views as alarmist atmospherics resulting from press coverage, quixotic rating agency actions, and state regulator political positioning.  A regional bank’s CFO cautioned that more data on actual mortgage performance in 2007 will soon be available, and that could force restatements in 2007 bank earnings.  Commenting on market illiquidity, one source said that in some fixed-income markets, where many on the buy side currently depend on moderate leverage to achieve the required rates of return, banks have greatly reduced their lending.  He also indicated that, even though there are real money investors—as he called them—interested in return to the structured-finance securities markets but currently on the sidelines, they are reluctant to expose themselves to volatility that arises under mark-to-market accounting using prices set in such illiquid markets.  These anecdotal inputs simply point to the continuing uncertainty and risk to financial stability with some potential, I think, for self-feeding hysteria. I share with my colleagues on the Committee worries about the heightened levels of inflation and uncertainties around my working forecast that inflation will moderate in 2008.  The assumptions about energy prices are the most precarious.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to take the position that the economy, with its apparently rapid deceleration compounded by continuing financial volatility, is a greater concern than inflation at this juncture.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Explanation: The given passage simply expresses gratitude to President Hoenig without containing any statements that indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 174.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me talk a bit about the region.  The Tenth District is generally moving forward at a fairly steady pace, but there are some mixed data.  The obvious wide variances are in real estate.  Housing is weak—not as weak as some parts of the country but still weak.  Also, it is interesting that commercial real estate in each of our major cities right now continues to do well.  I recently talked with several developers.  They are all doing well but are very concerned, and they are beginning to cut back on their plans and move away from them.  So you can see the worry carrying forward in terms of what actions they are taking.  In the agricultural area and in the energy area, real estate is a different story.  It is booming.  Land values have gone up in the ag part—non-irrigated land, something like 20 percent over the past year.  If you are near an ethanol plant, it has gone up 25 to 30 percent.  It is also interesting that the ag credit system is helping to fund that.  Their increase in lending was about 12 percent this past year.  That is up from about 9 percent the year before, so they are providing that.  They are also now involved in lending to these ethanol plants in a very significant way, helping to carry that boom forward.  That gives me some pause in terms of what is going on in some of the rural areas.  Related to that, the energy and lease values are also accelerating at a fairly high rate.  I found it reminiscent and somewhat disturbing in talking to a couple of individuals when they noted that the land values have about doubled over the past two or three years in some areas, and they said that I should relax because on current ag prices they should have tripled.  [Laughter]  Where have I seen that before. On the other side, actually, manufacturing in our region has held steady.  We have a lot of aircraft manufacturing, which is really strong, and some other smaller manufacturers providing support in both ag and energy, and they seem to be doing well.  Technology is also doing well in the region, especially in the mountain areas—the Colorado and Denver areas.  Engineering firms are still very strong—the strong demand for engineers and the unfilled positions continue.  They are supplying that service across the globe and see continued demand there.  So it is mixed, but overall probably our region is doing better than average relative to the rest of the nation. On the national level, my projections suggest that we are going to grow below our potential growth rate.  I am not as pessimistic as the Greenbook.  I also have inflation coming down, but that is on the assumption that we are able to reverse our monetary policy at a fairly quick pace as we move through this year and into 2009.  I will leave it there.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing an overview of the current state of the Tenth District and discussing various aspects of the economy in that region.


Passage number 175.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "thank you" and the mention of "President Stern" indicate a polite expression of gratitude, without any conflicting or opposing ideas present.


Passage number 176.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me talk about the economic outlook.  My initial comments are organized kind of along the lines of Dave Reifschneider’s exhibit 1.  There are certainly still some positive things going on:  growth in exports, and I think that is likely to continue; strength in the agricultural sector and in natural resources in general, outside of lumber and wood products; state and local construction spending—there seem to be a lot of schools, hospitals, sports stadiums, et cetera, being built now; and the labor market may be a bit better than the December household and payroll surveys depicted, given the low level of initial claims.  But I think those considerations are really overwhelmed by several factors on the negative side, and let me summarize those quickly.  First is the breadth of the negative news on the national economy that we have received recently.  The vast bulk of the news has been negative.  It doesn’t suggest to me that there is a lot of positive momentum or latent strength left in the economy.  The second factor I would cite—and this is not new—is the persistence of a large volume of unsold, unoccupied houses, with implications for activity in that sector, for prices, for wealth, and for foreclosures.  Of course, as somebody already noted, many recessions turn out to be inventory recessions.  If we have one, this will be an inventory recession, too; and the inventory in question is housing.  Third, maybe even more important, are the financial conditions themselves—prominently but not exclusively, the impaired capital positions of large banks and likely prospects for growing credit quality problems in auto loans, in credit cards, in commercial real estate, and perhaps in other areas as well.  Adding up those considerations, I think what we confront resembles the aftermath of the 1990-91 recession, when so-called headwinds restrained growth in real GDP, and my forecast anticipates something similar going forward, something like the persistent weakness scenario in the latest Greenbook.  So I expect subpar growth both this year and next year before better growth resumes in 2010.  I further expect lots of inertia in both core and overall measures of inflation this year and next before some diminution below 2 percent in 2010.  Thank you.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 180.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my view, economic conditions have deteriorated significantly since our December meeting.  Taken as a whole, the stories that have been relayed to me by my Fourth District business contacts have been downbeat, and several of the contacts are concerned that we may be slipping into a recession.  I’m hearing that consumer spending has declined appreciably since the soft December retail sales numbers were reported.  The CFO of one of the nation’s major department store chains told me last week that her company’s January sales are shaping up to be the worst that they have seen in the past twenty years.  She said that they had already cut back some of their buying plans because of the weak holiday sales, but after seeing the numbers for the first three weeks of January, she is concerned that they have not cut back buying plans enough.  In December I had heard some upbeat assessments about the demand for capital goods and exports, but in January the incoming numbers are softer, and expectations for the coming year are less optimistic than they were just a month ago. I’m also concerned that I’m now detecting the first signals of a credit crunch.  Bankers in my District tell me that they’re finding it much more difficult to issue debt and that they are safeguarding their capital.  I’ve heard several motivations for this, depending on the institution.  Some bankers are simply preparing for further losses.  Some are expecting to have to bring some downgraded assets back onto their balance sheets.  Even those bankers who have adequate capital say that they have become much more disciplined about how they’re going to allocate that capital.  Collectively, the concerns that bankers have expressed to me about capital have convinced me that credit will be less available and more expensive than it has been in quite a while.  Deals that bankers would have done for creditworthy borrowers not long ago are simply not being done today.  Of course, it’s possible that nonbank financial companies will step in and fill the gap, but it is not clear to me that they have the capital and the risk appetites to do so. These developments have had a significant influence on the economic projection that I submitted for today’s meeting.  Like many around the table, I continue to mark down my outlook for residential and nonresidential investment in response to the incoming data and also in response to greater business pessimism about the economic prospects.  In addition, I’ve built in a sharper and more protracted slowing in consumer spending stemming from greater deterioration in the household balance sheet and tighter credit market conditions.  These adjustments have caused me to cut my 2008 GDP growth projection about 1 percentage point since the December meeting, and some of that weakness spills over to the out years.  If credit conditions deteriorate further than I have expected, then my projection would more closely resemble the persistent weakness alternative scenario described in the Greenbook.  But that isn’t my projection for the economy.  Rather, my projection is roughly in line with the Greenbook baseline. My inflation outlook hasn’t changed much from where it was in December—or October, for that matter.  Like the Greenbook, I still project inflation to moderate as commodity prices level off and business activity wanes, but the risks to my inflation outlook have shifted to being weighted to the upside.  The December CPI report was not much improved from the troubling November data, and my business contacts continue to report that commodity prices are being passed downstream.  So I have less conviction in the inflation moderation than I did a month ago.  That said, the downside risks to the economy still dominate my thinking about the outlook today.  I do believe, however, that our policy response to date combined with an additional rate cut tomorrow will allow the economy to regain some momentum as we move into the second half of 2008.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing concern about the state of the economy and the possibility of a recession, while also discussing the potential risks and uncertainties regarding inflation. This suggests that there may be differing opinions or perspectives on the current economic situation and how to address it.


Passage number 181.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 182.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The contours of our forecast are broadly in line with the Greenbook:  Growth well below potential for the first half of this year results in additional slack in labor markets with a consequent reduction in the core rate of inflation over time.  Our forecast returns to full employment by 2010 only if we reduce interest rates more than they are in the Greenbook.  Thus, our baseline forecast assumes that we reduce rates 50 basis points at this meeting followed by additional easing in 2008, which eventually results in core inflation below 2 percent and the unemployment rate settling at our estimate of the NAIRU, somewhat below 5 percent.  But even with this easing, there are significant downside risks to this forecast.  Historically, increases in unemployment in excess of 0.6 percent and forecasts of two or more quarters of real GDP growth below 2 percent have almost always been followed by a recession.  In fact, a variety of probit models looking at the probability of recession in 2008 indicate an uncomfortably high probability of recession, in most cases above 50 percent. Several factors make me concerned that the outlook could be worse than our baseline forecast.  First, we have consistently underestimated weakness in residential investment.  While our forecast assumes a gradual decline in real estate prices, it does not have a substantial feedback between rising unemployment rates causing further downward pressure on real estate prices and the health of financial institutions.  Were we to reach a tipping point of higher unemployment, higher home foreclosures, increased financial duress, and falling housing prices, we would likely have to ease far more than if we were to act preemptively to insure against this risk.  Second, our weak consumption is driven by negative wealth effects induced by weakness in equity markets and modest declines in real estate prices.  However, the heightened discussion of a potential recession could easily result in a larger pullback by consumers.  This would be consistent with the behavior of rates on credit default swaps of major retailers, which have risen significantly since the middle of December.  Third, banks are seeing increasing problems with credit card debt.  Capital One, one of the few concentrated credit card lenders, has had their credit default swap rate rise from less than 100 basis points to more than 400 basis points as investors have become increasingly concerned about the retail sector.  While liquidity concerns have abated, credit risk for financial institutions has grown.  Rates on credit default swaps for our largest banks have been rising since December, despite the announcement of additional equity investments.  In addition, the greatest concern I hear raised by the financial community in Boston is a risk posed by the monoline guarantors.  The movement in equity prices last week as a result of highly speculative statements on resolving the monoline problem indicates a sensitivity of the markets to significant further deterioration in the financial position of the monolines.  Fourth, our model does not capture potential credit crunch problems, although supplementary empirical analysis conducted by the Boston staff suggests that such problems pose additional downside risks to our outlook.  Bank balance sheets continue to expand as banks act in their traditional role of providing liquidity during economic slowdowns.  While the balance sheet constraints are likely to be most acute at our largest institutions, further deterioration in real estate markets is likely to crimp smaller and midsize banks that have significant real estate exposures. Given my concerns that we could soon be or may already be in a recession, I believe the risks around our forecast of core inflation settling below 2 percent are well balanced.  Inflation rates have fallen in previous recessions, and I expect that historical regularity to be maintained if growth is as slow as I expect.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses concerns and risks that the outlook could be worse than the baseline forecast. They mention several factors such as weakness in residential investment, negative wealth effects, increased problems with credit card debt, and potential credit crunch problems. This shows that there is contention or disagreement with the baseline forecast.

Passage number 186.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I’m going to end dark, but it’s not all dark.  The world still seems likely to be a source of strength.  You know, we have the implausible kind of Goldilocks view of the world, which is it’s going to be a little slower, taking some of the edge off inflation risk, without being so slow that it’s going to amplify downside risks to growth in the United States.  That may be too optimistic, but the world still is looking pretty good.  Central banks in a lot of places are starting to soften their link to the dollar so that they can get more freedom to direct monetary policy to respond to inflation pressure.  That’s a good thing.  U.S. external imbalances are adjusting at a pace well ahead of expectations.  That’s all good, I think.  As many people pointed out, the fact that we don’t have a lot of imbalances outside of housing coming into this slowdown is helpful.  There’s a little sign of incipient optimism on the productivity outlook or maybe a little less pessimism that we’re in a much slower structural productivity growth outlook than before.  The market is building an expectation for housing prices that is very, very steep.  That could be a source of darkness or strength, but some people are starting to call the bottom ahead, and that’s the first time.  It has been a long time since we’ve seen any sense that maybe the turn is ahead.  It seems unlikely, but maybe they’re right. In the financial markets, I think it is true that there is some sign that the process of repair is starting.  We have seen very, very substantial adjustment by the major financial institutions; very, very substantial de-leveraging ahead as the institutions adjust to this much, much greater increase in macroeconomic uncertainty and downside risk; very, very substantial early equity raising by major firms; pretty substantial improvement in market functioning; and easing of liquidity pressure.  Those are useful, encouraging things.  There is a huge amount of uncertainty about the size and the location of remaining credit losses across the system.  But based on what we know, I think it’s still true that the capital positions of the major U.S. institutions coming into this look pretty good relative to how they did in the early 1990s.  Of course, as many people have said many times, there’s a fair amount of money in the world willing and able to come in when investors see prices at sufficiently distressed levels.  One more encouraging sign, of course, is that the timing, content, and design of the stimulus package look as though the package will be a modest positive.  It could have been a worse balance of lateness and poor design, but I think it looks to be above expectations on both timing and design, and it will help a little on the downside and take out some of the downside risk. Having said that, though, I think it is quite dark still out there.Like everyone else, we have revised down our growth forecast.  We expect very little growth, if any, in the first half of the year before policy starts to bring growth back up to potential.  The main risk, as has been true since August, is the dangerous self-reinforcing cycle, in which tighter financial conditions hurt confidence and raise recession probability, causing people to behave on the expectation that recession probably is higher, reinforcing the financial headwinds, et cetera.  The dominant challenge to policy is still to arrest that dynamic and reduce the probability of the very adverse outcome on the growth side.  Of course, we have to do that without risking too much damage to our inflation credibility and too much damage to future incentives and future resource allocation. Like many of you, I think the inflation outlook for the reasons laid out in the Greenbook is better than it was.  It’s not terrific, but it’s better.  The risks are probably balanced around the inflation outlook.  Our inflation forecast still has core PCE coming down below 2 percent over the forecast period.  There’s obviously a lot of uncertainty around that, but I really think that you can look at inflation expectations in the markets as somewhat reassuring on the credibility front to date.  So again, I think the key question for policy is how low we should get real short-term rates relative to equilibrium, and our best judgment is that we’re going to have to get them lower even with another 50 basis points tomorrow.  We’re still going to need to try to reinforce the signal that we’re going to provide an adequate degree of accommodation or insurance against this very dangerous risk of a self-reinforcing cycle in which financial weakness headwinds reinforce the risk of a much deeper and prolonged decline in economic activity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges both positive and negative aspects of the current economic situation and expresses the need for policy measures to address the challenges.


Passage number 187.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions the position or title of Governor Kohn without further information or context.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 188.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you.  Thank you, Vice Chairman Geithner, for a little less gloom here.  I didn’t expect the bright side from that source.  [Laughter]  Like everyone else around the table, I have revised down my forecast, which looks very much like the Greenbook:  a couple of quarters of very slow growth before a pickup in the second half of the year spurred by monetary and fiscal stimulus.  The collapse of the housing market has been at the center of the slowdown, and most recent information was weaker than expected.  There is no sign in the data anyhow that a bottoming out is in sight.  Sales of new homes have dropped substantially, and that must reflect reduced availability of credit, especially for nonprime and prime nonconforming loans, and perhaps buyers’ expectations of further price declines.  As a consequence, a steep drop in housing construction has made only a small dent in inventories, and those will continue to weigh on activity and prices.  Indeed, house-price declines in the Case-Shiller index picked up late last year.  I think we just got November. It looks increasingly as though other sectors are being affected as well, slowing from the earlier pace of expansion and slowing a little more than expected.  You can see this in broad measures of activity, as President Stern pointed out:  industrial production, purchasing manager surveys, and the employment report.  I think it is also evident in some measures of demand.  Retail sales data suggest a deceleration in consumer spending late in the fourth quarter.  Orders and shipments for capital equipment excluding aircraft picked up in December, but that followed a couple of months of flat or declining data.  A slowdown in consumption and nonhousing investment probably reflects multiplier-accelerator effects of the drop in housing, a decline in housing wealth, and additional caution by both businesses and households given the highly uncertain and possibly weakening economic outlook.  Certainly the anecdotes we’ve heard around the table reinforce the sense of business caution. But like other people, I see the softening outlook and the spread beyond the housing sector as importantly a function of what’s going on in the financial sector and of the potential interaction of that over time with spending.  We have seen improvements in short-term funding markets, in spreads, and in the leveling out of the ABCP (asset-backed commercial paper) outstandings, but investors and lenders seem increasingly concerned about the broader economic weakness and spreading repayment problems, and they are demanding much greater compensation for taking risk in nearly every sector.  To me one of the defining characteristics of the period since, say, mid-November is the spreading out from the housing sector of lending caution to other sectors in the economy.  Nonfinancial corporations have experienced declines in equity prices.  Credit spreads on both investment-grade and junk bonds have increased.  A substantial portion of banks reported tightening terms and standards for C&I loans.  Commercial real estate sector lenders are very concerned about credit.  Spreads on CMBS have risen substantially, and most banks—like  percent—tightened up on commercial real estate credit, and that has to affect spending in that sector over time.  Banks tell us that they are being more cautious about extending consumer credit, as President Yellen noted.  A number of large banks noted a pullback in this area and deterioration in actual and expected loan performance when they announced their earnings over the past few weeks.  There have also been increasing doubts about how robust foreign economies will remain, and this was evident in equity markets around the globe and in rising risk spreads on emerging-market debt.  The staff has marked down its forecast of foreign GDP growth again this round.  The total decrease in projected foreign growth in 2008 since last August has been around ½ percentage point, and this is at a time when we are counting on exports to support economic activity. The extraordinary volatility in markets is, I think, indicative of underlying uncertainty, and that underlying uncertainty itself will discourage risk-taking.  The uncertainty and the caution are partly feeding off the continued decline in housing, the still-unknown extent of the losses that will need to be absorbed, and the extent to which those losses are eroding the capital of key institutions like the monolines.  The monoline issue raises questions about who will bear the losses and provides another channel for problems spreading through the credit markets, through losses being felt or credit being taken back on bank balance sheets, making them more cautious, and even more directly, into the muni market through the monolines.  Despite these developments, my forecast for 2008 was revised down only a few tenths from October.  But that is because of the considerable easing of monetary policy undertaken and assumed in my forecast.  I assumed 50 at this meeting, and unlike that piker, President Yellen, I assumed another 50 over the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. While some participants are expressing a more negative outlook, Mr. Kohn seems to have a slightly more optimistic view, mentioning that his forecast for 2008 was only revised down by a few tenths from October.


Passage number 189.
 MS. YELLEN.  I’ll see you and up you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only includes a statement ("I’ll see you and up you") from Ms. Yellen, without any context or indication of contention or disagreement. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 190.
  [Laughter]   MR. KROSZNER.  This is a bad dynamic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing an opinion about a situation, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 191.
 MR. KOHN.  I thought we needed some insurance, and I also assumed some fiscal stimulus as in the Greenbook.  I still see, despite these policy responses, risks around my outlook for activity as skewed to the downside, and it’s because of the potential further increases in required compensation for risk and tightening standards for extending credit and the feedback on demand. Although inflation has been running higher than expected of late, and that is troubling, I expect it to ease back even with my more accommodative policy.  The combination we’ve seen of slower income growth and higher inflation suggests elements of a supply shock, and that’s obviously coming from the energy sector and its spillover into food.  It is true, as President Fisher pointed out, that some of those increases in food and energy prices are coming from demand from emerging-market economies, but to the extent that such demand is putting upward pressure on our prices and it’s not really sucking exports from the United States at any great rate, I think that it acts more like a supply shock on the U.S. economy than a demand shock.  Energy and other commodity prices should level off in an environment of slower global growth, and they’ve started to do that.  They have at least showed signs of leveling off recently.  Greater slack in resource utilization and product markets should discipline increases in costs and prices.  At least some of the reports about airlines suggest that they have tried to pass through fuel surcharges and have been unable to do so, and I think that’s an encouraging sign from the inflation perspective.  Any easing of inflation pressure does require that inflation expectations not begin to ratchet higher.  I agree with everyone else.  I’m persuaded that the balance of evidence is that they have not, despite the rise in five-year-forward inflation compensation and despite the persistently higher rate of increases of total headline than of core inflation.  But this is something we will need to monitor very carefully.  I interviewed Paul Volcker yesterday afternoon for our oral history project.  The discussion with him reminded me again of the high cost of reversing a rise in inflation once higher inflation expectations become entrenched.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not contentious or disagreeing. The speaker, Mr. Kohn, is sharing his thoughts and opinions on the current economic situation and expressing agreement with others on certain points.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It consists of a polite thank you note addressed to Governor Kroszner.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 194.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  Well, if that’s the optimistic scenario, I think we had all better pray.  But I think it’s a relatively balanced scenario that accurately reflects the risks that are there.  The Greenbook has done a very good job of trying to thread the needle, and I think making a close call for contraction but not actually calling it seems to be very reasonable.  The kinds of insurance discussions in both the Greenbook and the Bluebook and that we’ve had preliminarily here make a lot of sense.  Our models have never been successful at assessing turning points, and that is true whether they are the typical linear models, nonlinear models, probit models, Markov switching models, or other things like that.  We sort of know once we’ve switched, but it’s hard to get that transition.  As many people have suggested, there are an awful lot of indicators that would go into those kinds of models that would flash for contraction being likely.  I think that is correct, but that makes it very difficult for us to assess what will happen.  So I think—as well reflected in the projections—a lot of downside risk is there. I do share some of the optimism about improvements that we’ve seen in the financial markets, but I had that feeling in October and November, and it is hard for me to really understand exactly what drove the subsequent deterioration.  Certainly there were some issues around year-end, but it seems that more issues than just the year-end were driving the fairly significant reversal of improvement that occurred during October through mid-November and the fairly sudden backing up.  So I’m concerned that, since I don’t really understand what happened there, I don’t want to take too much comfort from what has happened so far.  But I also don’t want to dismiss what has happened so far because it’s certainly conceivable that things will move in a more linear way forward for improvement. One issue that I raised both at the last FOMC and in our various conference calls related to some discussions I’ve had with the major credit card companies, which in some sense have a very good feeling for real-time consumption.  I’ve talked with two major credit card companies, and they both had very negative views of what had happened in the very sharp transition consistent with a switch into a contractionary state from the discussions before the October FOMC versus before the December FOMC.  But in the most recent discussions, basically it flattened out.  It’s certainly not recovering, but it is not a continuing downward trend, which at least in my view provides a great deal of comfort because I was very concerned about the nonlinear break to a very low consumption state, and I think there’s less evidence of that.  I won’t go through the specifics of what they said, but basically we’re still seeing challenges and increases in personal bankruptcies, slower repayment rates, more people slipping from 30 days overdue to 60 days overdue, et cetera, et cetera.  But it’s not as dramatic a change, and it’s sort of within the range that they have been anticipating given the data from December.  Also as someone mentioned, and I have forgotten who, these numbers are still at relatively low levels.  Now, the change is in a very bad direction and certainly could move very quickly, and we’ve seen that in other recession scenarios.  But fortunately it seems, at least from this anecdotal evidence, that it isn’t a significant change to the downside, and it’s possible that it could just be re-flattening out.  My concern is still that sort of “slow burn” scenario that I’ve talked about and that Nellie and others have fleshed out on the pressures on banks’ balance sheets.  I liked Nellie’s very politically correct phrase “unplanned asset expansions.”  That’s a very nice way of putting like “oh, my goodness, something is suddenly on the balance sheet that we didn’t expect”—SIVs, asset-backed commercial paper, and so forth.  I think people are still waiting for the other shoe to drop, and the other shoe certainly could drop.  There may be things that we haven’t fully anticipated, but we know that there are still leveraged loans that they can’t get off their books, a pipeline that’s still coming on.  We know that many banks are still making mortgage loans and cannot get those off their books—at least the jumbo ones.  It’s conceivable that raising the limits at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae may help in the short run even if there may be costs in the longer run.   A number of other things could suddenly come on the balance sheets.  The example of what happened at SocGen is just another uncertainty that could be out there.  So even at a major financial institution that was generally quite well respected, something like this could happen.  A lot of finger pointing and a lot of uncertainty can come from that, and that’s broadly reflected in the CDS spreads.  About the point that Bill Dudley made in conversation with President Rosengren about being careful to say, well, CDS spreads are lower in Europe and that suggests there’s less risk in Europe—you have to take into account the reaction function by the governments, by the regulators, in terms of recapitalization, as Governor Warsh made reference to.  There are very real challenges, but overall we have seen these CDS spreads go up quite a bit.  So I think that concern about the negative dynamic scenario that people talked about is real, and that’s why it is very important to be thinking about buying insurance. With respect to inflation, certainly some of the numbers have been worrisome.  It is clear that inflation uncertainty is up.  We can disagree as to exactly what that means either about credibility or whether it is just uncertainty or whether it’s upside or downside scenarios, but I think it is up and that is something we should be concerned about.  We should carefully craft our message to take that into account because uncertainty can lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations, and that is something that we certainly don’t want to see.  I don’t see evidence of unanchoring yet, but I do see a potential first step in that direction, which does concern me.  The simple fact that a memo had to be written about what was going on with respect to some of these sharp movements suggests that it’s not clear.  Although the memo was excellent, I think there are elements in it that suggest we don’t fully understand and we need to be very careful about that.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. This can be seen in phrases such as "I do share some of the optimism..." and "But I also don’t want to dismiss what has happened so far..." These statements suggest that there are different perspectives and opinions about the current situation and its potential outcomes.


Passage number 195.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 196.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we’re all trying to be cheery here.  It reminds me a little of one of my favorite scenes in a movie, which is Monty Python’s “Life with Brian.”  I remember the scene with them there all on the cross, and they start singing “Look on the Bright Side of Life.”  [Laughter]  So let me talk a bit about my views on this.  My personality does do that, but it is really that I’m strapped a bit to the cross.  My view on the economy is that we are going to have quite a weak first part of 2008, in which we’re going to skirt recession.  This is my modal forecast.  I do think that the economy will be stronger in 2009 and 2010, but that’s because I decided to be even less of a piker than Governor Kohn.  He accused President Yellen, but I was going to accuse him because I did actually assume a 75 basis point cut at this meeting and then another 50 basis point cut at the meeting following.  Then I hoped that afterward we would be able to reverse.  Of course, this is something to discuss tomorrow, but it has to do with my views on how you deal with financial disruptions and risk management.  So I’ll talk about that tomorrow. Even though I have a scenario that looks okay, I do want to point out that four very significant downside risks really worry me.  We all talked about them.  Of course, the first is housing.  But I worry about a particular dynamic, which is that the negative price movements that we currently see could be getting worse.  People could be expecting that they’re getting worse, and therefore, they want to hold off from buying a house because the effective cost of capital is higher.  As somebody who stupidly is just going to contract on a new house because I have to please my wife, I actually thought exactly along these lines and was thinking about pulling out but then decided that my marriage was more important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 197.
   MR. STERN.  It was close.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply states that something was close.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 198.
  [Laughter]   MR. MISHKIN.  By the way, if you know my wife, no it wasn’t close.  The second issue is that the potential for weaker house prices, which really is a significant possibility, not only could lead to lower household wealth but, more important, also could reduce the value of collateral for households and as a result mean that the relaxation of credit constraints that collateral affords is no longer there.  That could have major implications in terms of household spending, so it is also a very substantial downside risk to PCE.  The third issue is that we also see that the financial disruption has already gotten worse.  The good news is that there has been improvement on the liquidity front, and I give a lot of credit to the TAF, which was superbly thought out by our staff and has been quite helpful.  However, credit conditions have worsened.  Particularly worrisome—and something that hasn’t been discussed much—is that the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey had substantial tightening.  Usually when you see this kind of tightening, it could indicate that we could have serious negative economic consequences.  Again, that actually makes me very nervous.  Finally, to get even more depressed, there really is potential for a negative feedback loop that has not yet set in.  The financial disruption that we’re seeing right now could then mean a more substantial worsening of the aggregate economy, and that could make the financial markets have even more strain, and you have a problem.  So I really worry about the downside risks and think that they are very substantial and that we should be very concerned about them in thinking about what the appropriate policy stance is. On the issue of inflation, I’m more sanguine.  I see inflation going down to 2 percent by 2009.  The key here is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded—in fact, are grounded at a level that is consistent with my inflation objective, around 2 percent on PCE, which might be different from others’ views, but that’s where I am right now.  In that context, given that inflation expectations plus expectations about future slack in the economy are the primary drivers of inflation dynamics, I actually think that inflation will come down.  It is true that the recent inflation numbers have been very bad; but in thinking about the overall risks, I’m a bit different from the average person on this Committee because I think the risks are balanced and actually somewhat to the downside.  The reason I say this is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded.  At the same time, there is a substantial downside risk in the economy that could really widen slack in the economy, and that would mean that inflation would come down. I don’t want to be too sanguine on the issue of inflation expectations being grounded.  In fact, one thing that I think we have to monitor very closely is what’s happening in terms of inflation expectations, particularly financial markets’ views of inflation expectations.  In a sense, I think of that as the canary in the coal mine.  We are also going to want to look at expectations spreading to professional forecasters and to households, but I think information would come in first in terms of the financial markets for the reason that they put their money on the table and react quickly.  That’s one reason I think it’s very important to look at things like inflation compensation.  But we do need to look at this and do the analysis.  My reading of the analysis that the staff gave and my thinking about the issue is that there is just no evidence that inflation expectations have gone up.  The story is extremely hard to tell to go in that direction.  However, it is very easy to tell a story that inflation uncertainty has gone up a lot, and this is something that President Evans talked about and we talked about at the very beginning of a long day.  In this context, that does concern me, and it really tells me that we have to think about whether we can better anchor inflation expectations.  So I think that this is something that we have to be concerned about, but I do not think that what has happened in inflation compensation is that the canary is dropping dead at this stage.  But we do have to monitor this very, very closely, and again, it’s part of the risk-management strategy that I think we have to pursue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses concern about downside risks and inflation uncertainty, while also acknowledging that inflation expectations are grounded. This suggests a disagreement or uncertainty about the direction of inflation and the potential risks to the economy.


Passage number 199.
 MR. MISHKIN.  I hope so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear indication of contention or disagreement. The statement made by Mr. Mishkin, "I hope so," is neutral and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 200.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  However, there appears to be a law of nature that the turnaround in the housing market is always six months from the present date.  We simply don’t have any evidence whatsoever that the housing market is bottoming out.  We have guesses and estimates about how far prices will fall and how far demand and construction will fall.  The key issue is prices, and we are far from seeing the worst case scenario that you could imagine in prices.  So long as we don’t see any stabilization in the housing market or stabilization in house prices, then I don’t think we can say that the downside risks to the economy or to the credit system have been contained.  Until that point, I think we need to be very, very alert to those risks. Everyone has talked about inflation, as should be the case.  I am also concerned.  The pickup in core inflation is disappointing.  There are some mitigating factors, such as the role of nonmarket prices, which tend not to be serially correlated.  We haven’t discussed owners’ equivalent rent in this meeting for the first time in a while, but we know that it can behave in rather odd ways during periods of housing slowdowns.  The hope is that energy and food prices will moderate; in fact, if oil prices do rise by less than the two-thirds increase of last year, it would obviously be helpful.  Nominal wages don’t seem to be reflecting high inflation expectations at this point.  So I think there are some reasons for optimism; but as many people pointed out, there are upward pressures, including the point that President Fisher made that the lagged effects of the previous increases in energy, food, and other commodity prices have probably not been fully realized in core inflation.  Furthermore, as we’ll talk about more tomorrow, to the extent that we decide at this meeting to take out some insurance against downside risks, then implicit in that insurance premium might be a greater risk of inflation six months or a year from now.  So we have to take that into account as we think about policy and about our communications, as President Plosser and others have pointed out.  In particular, as Governor Mishkin and others have noted, we need to think about a policy strategy that will involve not only providing adequate insurance against what I consider to be serious downside risks but also a policy strategy that involves removing the accommodation in a timely way when those risks have moderated sufficiently. So my reading of the situation is that it’s exceptionally fluid and that the financial risks, in particular—as we saw, for example, after the October meeting—can be very hard to predict.  There are a lot of interactions between the financial markets and the real economy that are potentially destabilizing, and so we are going to have to be proactive in trying to stabilize the situation, recognizing that we have a confluence of circumstances that is extraordinarily difficult and that no policy approach will deliver the optimal outcome in the short term.  We’re just going to have to try to choose a path that will give us the best that we can get, given the circumstances that we’re facing. All right.  Any further comments or questions.  We will reconvene tomorrow at nine o’clock.  There is a reception and dinner, optional, available in the Martin Building.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any direct disagreement or contention. It discusses various factors and considerations related to the housing market, inflation, and policy strategy, but there is no clear disagreement or contention presented.


Passage number 201.
 [Meeting recessed] January 30, 2008—Morning Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  Let’s begin our meeting by calling on Dave Stockton to report on the GDP data.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating that a meeting is about to begin, and Dave Stockton will be reporting on the GDP data. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 202.
 MR. STOCKTON.4  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My dictionary defines a miracle as an event so improbable that it appears to defy the laws of nature.  Along those lines, we distributed a GDP report that compares our forecast with the actual number that was published this morning, and they are exceedingly close.  [Laughter]  As you can see comparing the Greenbook and advance estimate columns, in fact, it wasn’t just close on the top line, but it was really quite close in terms of the various components.  Personal consumption and business fixed investment were very close to our estimate.  Residential investment was not quite so weak in the advance release as it was in our forecast; that might reflect either a different estimate by the BEA about cost per start or something they know about additions and alterations that we don’t.  In the opposite direction, federal spending—in particular, defense spending—was weaker in the advance estimate than we have incorporated in the Greenbook estimate.  At the bottom of the table are the price indexes.  Both total PCE and core PCE were spot-on with the forecast.  Really, I didn’t see anything in this report that would alter our outlook at all going forward.  I would just note, obviously, that both the advance estimate and our Greenbook estimate are based on partial data.  There is still a lot left to be learned about the fourth quarter, and even more about the first quarter going forward.  One other piece of information that became available this morning was the ADP report for private nonfarm payroll employment.  That report showed an increase of 130,000.  Looking at that report and thinking about our forecast of 20,000, we’d probably up our forecast to about 50,000 for the month, following our normal rules of thumb in responding to that.  Quite frankly, I don’t think that particular piece of information would alter my view about the state of the labor market going forward.  As we noted yesterday, we have seen a fair number of other indicators suggesting that there has been some softening in the labor markets.  I think that is probably still the best bet going forward, so I don’t think at this point we would change too much our employment forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting information and discussing its implications.


Passage number 203.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there any questions for Dave.  If not, Brian, would you like to talk now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks if there are any questions for Dave, and if not, suggests that Brian can speak next.


Passage number 204.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Brian.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it consists of gratitude ("Thank you") and inquiries about whether there are any questions for Brian or Governor Mishkin.


Passage number 205.
 MR. MISHKIN.  I would like to ask a question and possibly make a comment about the risk-management strategies.  Am I correct in understanding that the treatment of expectations is basically backward-looking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Mishkin is simply asking for clarification and stating his understanding.


Passage number 206.
 MR. MADIGAN.  That is correct, Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Madigan agrees with Governor Mishkin's statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 207.
 MR. MISHKIN.  So even though you know I am a fan of—well, let’s put it this way, you said moderation, and I am not a fan of moderation in many dimensions.  But there is a potential cost here that is not articulated, which is that if there is a very aggressive easing and it has an effect on inflation expectations, then the more benign scenario that we have in terms of cost may not be there.  This is one of the reasons that, if we think about a risk-management approach, we have to think about whether we can do it more systematically.  What kind of communications would be attached to it.  Also, what kind of information would we have to watch out for to make sure that we don’t unhinge inflation expectations.  So although I think this is a terrific box and it was very, very useful, there is a bit of a qualm here.  It is also very hard to model the issue of what would happen to expectations.  So I am not complaining in any way about the usefulness of this; but we should have another concern, which is how we would manage inflation expectations if we pursued an approach like this.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Mishkin, expresses a qualm or concern about the potential cost of aggressive easing and the impact it could have on inflation expectations. He mentions the need for a risk-management approach and discusses the difficulty in modeling the issue of expectations. This indicates that there is contention or disagreement regarding the potential consequences of pursuing an approach like this.


Passage number 208.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 209.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question is related to what Governor Mishkin just asked about.  The risk-management analysis was very helpful; it was a very good addition, and it captures a number of things that we have talked about.  One is sort of a quick policy reversal or the potential for that if things go well.  My question is, How do you see the path of communications likely to evolve.  What is it going to look like.  What will it sound like if we are thinking about reversing policy, and we get to the bottom, and then we start taking it back a little more quickly than normal.  A lot of times when we have done this before you heard the phrase that markets need to be prepared for this and they have to understand it.  Would that somehow get in the way of the stimulus.  I think this gets a bit at what Governor Mishkin was talking about in terms of expectations.  In particular, do you have any thoughts about how the slope of the yield curve might help inform how people are going to be thinking about this.  Are we going to move from something that is potentially inverted or flat to a rising yield curve that could inform a better outlook, and then raising rates could maybe in a parallel fashion move the yield curve up.  I am just curious whether that could be helpful for the communications strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is a series of questions and inquiries about the path of communications and the potential effects of policy reversal.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 210.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I think my response is that it is very difficult to say how your communications should or will evolve going forward at this point because of the very substantial uncertainty in the economic outlook, which shows up very clearly in the Committee participants’ economic forecasts.  Presumably, what you say will depend on evolving circumstances.  In terms of the yield curve, again, I think that is difficult.  That will depend on the interaction of market participants’ perception of incoming economic information with their sense of your own policy reactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that it is difficult to predict how communications and the yield curve will evolve due to uncertainty in the economic outlook and the interaction of market participants' perceptions and policy reactions.


Passage number 211.
 MR. EVANS.  I’m just curious if, in the path of this simulation, the yield curve behaves in that fashion or not.  This gets at what the mechanism is for the stimulus.  Is it to improve market liquidity, market functioning, long rates, or an expectation of short rates.  If they start expecting a tightening, is that going to get in the way of something, and so we are going to view that as more difficult to move at that time.  I think everybody is quite committed to the idea that we need to do the right type of policy reversal when it is called for, but it is going to be very difficult to identify in the moment.  So the yield curve could help.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing curiosity and asking questions about the behavior of the yield curve and its potential impact on market liquidity, functioning, and interest rates. They also mention the difficulty of identifying the right time for policy reversal. However, these statements do not involve any disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 212.
 MR. MADIGAN.  In these simulations, the standard channels of monetary policy are working through things like the yield curve, asset prices, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, household wealth, et cetera.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that in these simulations, the standard channels of monetary policy are working through various factors such as the yield curve, asset prices, foreign exchange value of the dollar, and household wealth.


Passage number 213.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply acknowledges the gratitude of Mr. Evans, there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 214.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not give any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states President Lacker's title without further information.


Passage number 215.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I want to compliment you and the staff for presenting these risk-management strategies.  I think it is really useful for the Committee to see and think about these in terms of strategies rather than sort of one-off policy choices, and thinking through a sequence of actions like this is very, very helpful.  Governor Mishkin asked about expectations and noted that they were backward-looking, and I wanted to ask about that.  You guys have described to us before that there are firms and wage setters and then there are financial markets.  Is there a forward-looking part in the financial markets, or is that backward-looking as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 216.
 MR. MADIGAN.  The financial markets are forward-looking in these simulations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the financial markets are forward-looking in these simulations.


Passage number 217.
   MR. LACKER.  As you know, in applied macroeconomics, there is a range of approaches to handling expectations, and the rest of the range is filled out with more forward-looking approaches.  In this instance—in the instance of a recession—you hear and read a lot about recession.  In fact, there was a story in the paper today about businesses preparing for a recession.  So you get the sense that market participants might be understanding that this is a special episode of economic dynamics called a recession and look back to past recessions and think of it in sort of a forward-looking way.  That to me, more than in the usual circumstances, heightens the value of thinking through or at least exploring the implications of a forward-looking approach to expectations.  I say that in particular thinking about these strategies because we get only a few trials on recessions.  They are pretty rare, and so the inferences a set of market participants are going to make about recessions is going to be influenced by their past recessions.  This is going to be the last chance to influence their perceptions about how we behave in the next recession.  So I am really interested in thinking through our strategy for this recession from the point of view of, well, what if from now on market participants expect us to adopt the strategy that we do adopt in this.  That is why I would like to see some analysis that says, “Well, all right, if this is the strategy and it is understood by agents that this is our strategy, how does the economy behave.”  So we adopt a strategy, and it is one that we think we can sustain and one that we would like to choose again in the future if it is understood. Related to that, Governor Mishkin mentioned inflation and inflation expectations, and I was a little confused about the discussion yesterday because I always thought of us as wanting to minimize the distortion in the rate of return on money, and that suggests minimizing the raw-return gap between nominal and real securities.  So I am not quite sure that we don’t care nearly as much about the variance in inflation or the risk premiums due to inflation as we do about expected inflation.  Is that your understanding when you guys think through optimal monetary policy.  I know you do scenarios like that.  I mean, how do the fluctuations and the variance in inflation fit in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is solely expressing the speaker's thoughts and questions about the approach to handling expectations and optimal monetary policy in the context of a recession.


Passage number 218.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I don’t think they fit in in a direct way.  We still have a lot of work ahead of us, despite the progress that we have made in modeling in recent years, to consider things like the distribution of different economic outcomes and how skewness in those distributions, both with respect to output and with respect to inflation, would interact with risk-aversion in monetary policymaking.  I don’t think our science has quite gotten to that stage yet, but I agree that these are worthwhile things to study further.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker agrees that studying things like the distribution of different economic outcomes and skewness in those distributions is worthwhile. They also mention that the science has not reached a stage to fully consider these factors yet.


Passage number 219.
 MR. LACKER.  One thought I had in that discussion about expected inflation, you noted that the one-to-five-year rise in inflation hadn’t been affected much, but the five-to-ten-year rise had.  If it is well understood by agents when going through something like a recession, which comes around only every once in a while, maybe it is ratifying current inflation and not bringing it down.  You might expect that the inference would change about how inflation behaves in the next recession, which would come five to ten years from now.  Wouldn’t it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve contention or disagreement. It is a statement and a question posed by Mr. Lacker, seeking further clarification about inflation behavior during recessions.


Passage number 220.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I see the point you are making, and that sounds plausible.  You know, again, our thought was that, if investors were concerned that monetary policy makers were making an inflationary mistake, it would begin to affect inflation in the near term, meaning within several years rather than seven or eight years ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Madigan acknowledges the point made by the speaker and finds it plausible.


Passage number 221.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have just a technical question on inflation expectations.  You presented to us at some point a variation of the model in which the policy action itself was fed into the model for inflation expectations.  Is that part of the model at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward request for clarification on a specific part of a model.


Passage number 222.
 MR. STOCKTON.  No.  It is not part of the baseline model that we are running off of.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the baseline model they are using.


Passage number 223.
   MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  That is operating here very much.  It is the same mechanism, but it works differently in the two cases, because in the case where the recession actually shows up, whether you take the gradualist approach or you take the risk-management approach, they see the recession, and the easing in monetary policy doesn’t surprise them very much, although we can take our risk-management approach and respond a bit more than usual.  But then, things behave as they expect, and so not too much happens to inflation expectations.  In the other case, in which recession doesn’t emerge, they say, “Oh, this was an easing that wasn’t expected,” and then it becomes critical how long you hold it.  If you hold it and you get rid of it only gradually, then inflation expectations start to shift up.  They think the Fed’s inflation goal has changed.  In the case where you take it away quickly, they say, “Okay, you took it away quickly,” and so not much happens to long-run inflation expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining how the mechanism works differently depending on whether or not a recession occurs.


Passage number 224.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So the answer is that the funds rate is affecting inflation expectations in these simulations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states that the funds rate is affecting inflation expectations in the simulations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 225.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  In both cases.  But the question is whether it is viewed in the context of what is happening to output and inflation, whether they say, “Yes, that fits with the historical pattern of stabilization,” or whether, because the recession didn’t emerge, this looks as though it was after the fact an ease in policy that was not warranted.  Then the question is, Do you take it away quickly, or do you take it away slowly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker presents two perspectives or views on whether the policy of easing was warranted or not. The question of whether to take away the policy quickly or slowly also indicates a potential disagreement on the best approach.


Passage number 226.
   MR. LACKER.  Okay.  So in the case where we are doing the risk-management approach, do they understand that we are more likely to reverse course, or do they just mark down their whole expected path for policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individual is simply asking a question to clarify whether the other party understands a specific aspect of the risk-management approach.


Passage number 227.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  No, they don’t know that you are more likely to reverse course in that case.  So when you think of a communication strategy, which is not in these simulations, it says, “Oh, we’re going to do this, but in the event that the recession doesn’t occur, we will take it away more quickly than we might have based on historical averages.”  But it doesn’t make too much difference in the simulation, because it is taken quickly.  Just because the funds rate is down surprisingly low for a quarter or two, that is not long enough to have much of an effect on long-run inflation expectations in that simulation.  What it would do in the real world is different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 228.
   MR. LACKER.  We are trying to model the real world.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they are attempting to create a realistic model of the real world.


Passage number 229.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 230.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  There is a “castle in the sand” quality in this discussion.  Let me make just three points on what I took from this and see if I got it right.  One is, in the staff’s judgment, at 3 percent—in that view of the world, which is not way off from where the discussion was yesterday—policy is not providing any degree of insurance or accommodation against the adverse outcomes that may be ahead.   The second thing I took away is that this framework seems like a good way of thinking about how you think about moving lower, how you think about what mistake we’re going to make or we want to make.  We are going to make a mistake, but it is good to think about what mistake is more costly and what mistake is easier to correct.  It seems to me it tells us almost nothing, frankly, about when we are going to be in a position where we are going to want to start to take it back.  It also probably tells us very little about how quickly we are going to want to take it back.  I would have thought that the most remarkable thing in these paths is how little difference the variance is in the outcomes a year out.  I mean, they must be so far within the range of uncertainty in this context, and for us to start thinking now about how to design the optimal exit and communicate it, not just for President Evans’s reasons but many others, just basic humility, it seems to me kind of premature.  I have a lot of sympathy for the fact that we will want to make sure that we are choosing which error we are going to make.  I have a lot of sympathy for thinking through how we correct for that error.  But for us to assert, because we are worried about the implications of that, that we are going to start focusing now on the design of the exit, sounds to me a bit like a statement of the obvious.  Of course we are going to move with alacrity to take back and make sure those inflation expectations stay anchored at a reasonable level.  Of course we are.  To suggest otherwise and to assert it would look kind of insecure—a lack of confidence in what we are here to do.   The third thing I took away from it is that it seems to say that, if you make policy in a way consistent with the response of this Committee over the past decade and a half or so, you have pretty good outcomes in the strategy in which you take out enough risk against the downside error.  Now, life could be uncertain.  Maybe that is too charitable to the past, but it seems to be kind of reassuring in that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing the author's interpretation and understanding of a discussion.


Passage number 231.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think that it is hard to generalize.  You say there are so few recessions, so the specific communication that is undertaken—for example, in the last episode there was actually communication that leaned against the rapid reversal—you know, “considerable period” and so on.  So rather than trying to generalize from two examples, I think it would much more have to do with how we present the outlook and communicate our intentions.  Other questions for Brian.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a nuanced discussion about the difficulty of generalizing and the importance of effective communication.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 232.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Yes.  I just want to make a comment about what President Geithner said and follow up on President Evans’s question.  One thing that the simulation doesn’t get at is the adverse feedback loop.  It’s just not built into the model.  So the benefits of pursuing a risk-management approach are not as clear as they would be if they were included in the simulation.  However, I would like to focus on President Evans’s issue because I think it really is critical.  He asked about how we might know whether or not we should reverse and talked about things like the yield curve.  But one thing that is important to recognize in this scenario is that I think it is very unusual in terms of this Committee’s past behavior.  But I don’t know.  Don, you are my man who is the ancient mariner here.  Have we ever reversed this quickly in past episodes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker disagrees with the simulation, stating that it does not include the adverse feedback loop and therefore the benefits of pursuing a risk-management approach are not clear. Additionally, the speaker expresses uncertainty about the Committee's past behavior, questioning whether they have ever reversed quickly in past episodes.


Passage number 233.
 MR. KOHN.  By “this quickly,” what do you mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a question and does not indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 234.
 MR. MISHKIN.  What the path of the prompt reversal is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 235.
 MR. KOHN.  I think it depends.  As the Chairman was saying, there hasn’t really been a typical recession.  Right.  We have had two recessions in the past twenty years, and I think in both cases we stayed down longer because of the circumstances.  So in 1992-93, we had a zero real funds rate while the economy was growing for two years.  Then when we started raising, we did raise very quickly.  So I think that was mixed.  I can remember presenting to the Board, as a staff member, charts in 1990 showing how interest rates always reversed with the trough of the recession, a couple of months this way, a couple of months that way.  And that was just wrong.  I mean, it was just a different circumstance because of the 50 mile an hour headwinds.  So it is going to be very hard to set expectations about what we are going to do that will influence people in the future because each episode is so different.  As the Chairman was saying, we were very worried in 2003-04 that people would generalize from 1994 and see us reversing rather quickly, so we got into this verbal gymnastics to try to modify their expectations because we thought the rapid reversal in that case would not be consistent with macroeconomic stability.  This is a case in which we are just going to have to judge when we get to the circumstances what is necessary without knowing ahead of time what the pattern is going to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is providing their own perspective on past recessions and their uncertainty about future patterns, but there is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 236.
 MR. MISHKIN.  So let me turn back to President Evans’s question because there is an issue about what kind of information might tell us that we took out insurance and then it wasn’t needed.  I think some pieces of information that the staff has been looking at are relevant.  Particularly important in this regard is that there are a lot of indicators of financial stress.  What is different about this episode is that the reason we are so worried about downside risk is the financial strains, and there are a lot of pieces of information that the staff has been producing that could be very important in terms of looking at this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 237.
  They have a financial—I don’t know what you call your indicator, but you have something that you have been using in your model, Dave, that takes up spreads and volatility and—   MR. STOCKTON.  Principal components.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply describing a financial indicator or model that takes into account spreads, volatility, and principal components.


Passage number 238.
 MR. MISHKIN.  —principal components of these things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Mishkin is discussing the principal components of something, but there is no statement or indication of any disagreement or opposing views.


Passage number 239.
 MR. STOCKTON.  There are a lot of financial variables.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that there are a lot of financial variables without presenting any opposing arguments or disagreements.


Passage number 240.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Also an issue that the Chairman raised yesterday was that the housing market is a big component of our downside risk.  The market’s concerns about future declines in housing prices are causing a very sharp decrease in demand for housing.  That could turn around very quickly as well.  Even now we should be thinking about these issues, and Governor Kohn’s use of the word “nimble”—I like “flexibility,” but I think “nimble” is probably a better word—is really I think key here.  It is somewhat of a departure from normal—exactly what the Chairman said.  This episode is different from past episodes.  So we do need to start thinking about this, and the staff will need to think about exactly these issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any obvious contention or disagreement. It is discussing the Chairman's concerns about the housing market and the need to be agile in addressing potential declines in housing prices. There is no contradicting or conflicting information presented.


Passage number 241.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole, you had an interjection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. An interjection is a sudden or brief interruption in speech, so it does not imply any contention or disagreement in this context.


Passage number 242.
 MR. POOLE.  Yes.  I am older than Governor Kohn, so I can answer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Poole is older than Governor Kohn, allowing him to answer a question.


Passage number 243.
  [Laughter] MR. MISHKIN.  It is not age.  It is how long you have been in the System.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The conversation is lighthearted, indicated by the laughter, and Mr. Mishkin provides a statement without any opposing views or disagreement.


Passage number 244.
  MR. POOLE.  1958 was just about like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it is simply stating a fact without any opposing views or conflicting statements.


Passage number 245.
  MR. LACKER.  Like what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for examples or further clarification on a particular topic without expressing any opposing views.


Passage number 246.
 MR. POOLE.  Like that prompt reversal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply describes a prompt reversal.


Passage number 247.
 MR. LACKER.  Oh, interesting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. It simply shows the speaker expressing interest in the topic being discussed.


Passage number 248.
 MR. POOLE.  It was very much a sharp V.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating a fact about something being sharp and V-shaped.


Passage number 249.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without the actual text. Please provide the passage so that I can analyze it and provide an answer.


Passage number 250.
 MR. EVANS.  I just wanted to point out that the reason I asked the question about how you think about the exit strategy is that, since we are putting a lot of discussion weight on the reversal, it is going to color how you think about the next move potentially, if not today then another day.  So I think it brings the future into the present very quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the speaker's intention and their belief that discussing the exit strategy will impact future decision making.


Passage number 251.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage only mentions President Lacker without providing any information about his views or any potential disagreement or contention.


Passage number 252.
 MR. LACKER.  If I could just continue the dialogue with Governor Kohn.  It has been observed by some that the past two recessions differ from previous post-war recessions in some key dimensions, and some have drawn the conclusion that it is the changing nature of the business cycle after the Great Moderation.  Both have been characterized as shallow and longer lasting.  I take the point that one’s inferences about a third instance are going to be very tenuous, naturally.  But it is also natural to look back to those episodes and see what we can draw out of them.  You mentioned headwinds in 1990, and we had some special stuff that kept us from raising rates with nimbleness in 2003 and 2004.  To what extent do you think that is likely coming out of this episode, that the types of things that kept us from raising rates in the 1990s and in both of these episodes are likely to recur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is simply a continuation of a dialogue between Mr. Lacker and Governor Kohn, where they discuss the past recessions and the factors that may have contributed to their characteristics.


Passage number 253.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  May I answer that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "May I answer that" is a request for permission to provide a response, so it does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 254.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, I asked Governor Kohn, but if he gets to respond.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they asked Governor Kohn a question.


Passage number 255.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I will follow Don.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's intention to follow someone named Don.


Passage number 256.
   MR. KOHN.  I think we are really getting into the policy discussion right now, and the issue, really, will be the headwinds, the financial market restraint.  So it is reasonable to think that we are facing at least 25 mile an hour headwinds.  I also think that it is going to take a while for the headwinds to abate.  It is going to take a while to rechannel these credit flows, to restart many of the secondary markets in mortgages.  So my personal view is that I wouldn’t be surprised to see us having to run with a real federal funds rate that is below the historical average for some time.  But as everyone has been saying, it is highly uncertain and very dependent on how the financial markets evolve and how the real economy responds to those markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This passage is stating an individual's personal views and opinions on the current economic situation and the potential future actions that may be necessary. It does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 257.
 MR. LACKER.  For follow-up before President Geithner responds, to the extent that we place greater likelihood on that, should these simulations suggest that we should take that into account in how rapidly we cut now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply stating that "if these simulations suggest that we should take that into account in how rapidly we cut now." There is no explicit disagreement or contention being expressed.


Passage number 258.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t think so.  I would just point out that with the 1990-91 episode, inflation after the recession—after the whole episode was over—was significantly lower than in the period before it.  So if there are headwinds that are bringing the economy below potential and are causing high unemployment, for example, there has to be a mechanism.  Expectations have to be tied to something, and there has to be some way in which excessively low interest rates are stimulating inflation, through either commodity prices or wage pressures or some other mechanism.  If those pressures aren’t there because of headwinds or some other factor, then unusually low interest rates will not by themselves create inflation.  Vice Chairman, did you have anything else you wanted to add.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting a logical argument and explaining a cause-and-effect relationship. They are not opposing or contradicting any other viewpoint.


Passage number 259.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I really couldn’t tell, President Lacker, what inference you were going to draw from that.  But I would just reinforce the point that, if you are more worried and uncertain now about the magnitude of the headwinds and the duration, I think it has to mean that you err on the side of going lower sooner.  But the main point is that we just don’t know much about it, and I think it is worth a lot of humility.  I mean, think how surprised we have been by so much over this period, even with all our thinking through three years ago about alternative paths for housing.  So I would just vote for humility.  But the basic point is that we have to err on the side of being worried about reducing the risk that you end up with 75 mile an hour headwinds rather than 25 for a long period of time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is emphasizing the importance of being cautious and humble in their approach due to the unpredictability and uncertainty of the situation.


Passage number 260.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Could we start our policy round.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states a request to start a policy round and mentions President Pianalto, without providing any conflicting views or opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 261.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the Greenbook, my projection for the real economy incorporates a sharp decline in the equilibrium real fed funds rate.  Given the large risks facing the real economy, I think we need to take precautions against having a restrictive fed funds rate target.  I think a 50 basis point cut in the target fed funds rate today may be large enough to eliminate that possibility, although there is plenty of uncertainty around that estimate, as we have been discussing.  Based on my analysis, comments from my business contacts, and what I have heard from all of you at this meeting, I feel very comfortable supporting this position today.  The economic environment has been volatile and highly uncertain, and I realize that my outlook could change appreciably in the weeks and months ahead.  I can imagine that my economic projections will evolve in a way that supports even further reductions in the fed funds rate target. At the same time, as I said yesterday, I am concerned about inflation risks and that they may now be elevated.  I can also imagine scenarios that would lead me to want to pursue a more restrictive policy than would be appropriate based on the downside risk to growth alone.  At some point, on the margin, inflation concerns could become my dominant concern.  We know that inflation expectations play a crucial role in determining the inflation outlook.  We have been talking about that.  But, unfortunately, we don’t really know all that much about what it is going to take to unanchor inflation expectations.  It is hard to know for certain how far out on the ice we can skate without needing to worry that the ice has become too thin.  I know that we are bringing our best thinking to bear on this issue by developing diagnostic tools such as the decomposition of inflation compensation into its component parts, as we talked about yesterday and this morning.  I hope that we are going to come to learn that these tools are useful guides to policy, but we just don’t have enough experience with them to know how much confidence to place in their estimates. Yesterday Governor Kohn told us about his conversation with Paul Volcker and that Paul Volcker told him that unfortunately we do have experience of seeing the erosion of public confidence in our ability to meet our price stability objective, and we know from this experience that it makes the attainment of price stability more costly.  But today I support the policy directive expressed in alternative B.  My concerns today are more with the downside risk to economic growth.  Given what I know today, I think it is the right course of action.  I have discovered during the past couple of weeks that I can be very nimble when it comes to the reduction in our fed funds rate target.  If inflation developments require, I want to be just as nimble in the other direction.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: In this passage, Ms. Pianalto expresses her support for a 50 basis point cut in the target fed funds rate, citing the risks facing the real economy. However, she also mentions that she is concerned about inflation risks and that they may now be elevated. She states that at some point, inflation concerns could become her dominant concern, indicating a potential disagreement or contention regarding the appropriate monetary policy stance.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named President Hoenig.


Passage number 263.
 MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the discussion I have heard so far, it is apparent to me that we will most likely move to a 3 percent fed funds rate today.  If we do so, I think we should be prepared to stop at this point and let the market work through the disturbances that only time and market adjustments will correct.  While I would not pre-commit to no further cuts, I would give no hint of them either.  I think that is important.  The discussion we just had around this table is that we cannot know the future, there are always headwinds, and we will make a mistake.  Therefore, we should limit ourselves to some extent.  As I have expressed in this Committee before, I think we should narrow the range to which we are willing to move the fed funds rate.  My judgment is that to move to levels outside the reasonable range that, yes, I know would be debated, but a reasonable range of neutral, is as likely to introduce disturbances into the economy as it is to moderate the economy’s performance. I find an approach to policy that focuses on the real equilibrium rate compelling.  I think it is good theory, and it is common sense and can be explained to the public.  I understand that we cannot observe the equilibrium rate, but we cannot observe the NAIRU, potential GDP, or most other criteria.  The real rate is at least related to the policy tool that we focus on, which is interest rates.  When you systematically move below or above the neutral rate, you systematically stimulate or restrict the economy.  With that in mind, and since monetary policy works with a lag, I would recommend that we follow a policy in which we stop moving rates and let the market work once we are notably below or above the long-run neutral rate based upon a reasonable estimate.  This is a credible approach to policy.  Today, a nominal 3 percent fed funds rate would provide for an actual inflation-adjusted rate that is less than 1 percent.  That is quite stimulative.  That will serve to support the real economy as the financial sector adjusts, and it has to adjust.  To stimulate the economy further at our current inflation rate is to invite, or at least to increase the probability of, higher inflation or encourage the next asset bubble or both, and it will undermine our credibility in the long run. Turning to the press statement, I have three brief comments.  First, in paragraph 2, I would begin by putting the economic rationale before the financial market reference, which would most appropriately align our recent actions with our concern for the downside risk to the economy and place our concern for financial market stress in better perspective.  Second, I believe that a detailed discussion of inflation risk may not be helpful at this time, and the less said the better.  Therefore, I prefer the language in paragraph 3 of alternative B rather than any other of the options.  Finally, I believe we should modify the risk assessment to provide more flexibility for future decisions.  Most important, it should place less emphasis on the possibility of future rate cuts and better position us to return to a neutral position later this year and early next.  Therefore, I would rewrite paragraph 4 along the lines that President Plosser suggested.  To summarize, I suggest that we act at this meeting, explain our action as I suggested, and hold at that point.  Thank you.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "Thank you. President Rosengren" does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a simple expression of gratitude directed towards President Rosengren.


Passage number 265.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B, though I think a case can be made for alternative A.  The Boston model indicates that even after a 50 basis point reduction, we still need more easing to return to an economy with both full employment and inflation below 2 percent.  Taking out insurance against more-severe downside risks would imply even more easing than our baseline forecast.  Given our recent move and the additional easing in alternative B, I am comfortable waiting to take more aggressive action only if incoming data warrant it.  However, I will not be surprised if we find further action is indeed needed. What would be the arguments against taking an aggressive tack.  Certainly, one argument might be that elevated oil and commodity prices and core inflation currently above 2 percent warrant a more restrained approach.  However, I would note that in previous recessions the inflation rate has declined significantly, even in the 1970s, in the midst of historic surges in energy and food prices.  Whether we skirt a recession or experience a recession, I expect core inflation to trend down.  A potential second argument is that we have responded too slowly to the need for tighter policy in the past, so we should be more reluctant to ease in the present.  While it may be true that we raised rates too slowly at the onset of previous expansions, I see no reason for this Committee to behave in a manner that it believes is suboptimal.  As a Committee, we seem to have consensus on the importance of maintaining low inflation rates, and I am confident we have the will to raise rates with the same alacrity that we reduced them, should economic conditions warrant such action.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B, but also acknowledges that a case can be made for alternative A. They mention arguments against taking an aggressive approach, but ultimately express confidence in the committee's ability to make the right decision based on economic conditions.

Passage number 268.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the best course of action today is to lower the fed funds rate by 50 basis points as in alternative B.  I’ve heard cogent arguments that 50 basis points would be restrictive and likewise accommodative.  Yesterday I had a chance to look at the disabilities-related display in the elevator lobby on the Concourse Level, and I took some comfort in the fact that many great people are or were bipolar.  So whether it’s restrictive or accommodative, I can be convinced either way.  I can live with the idea that this does not incorporate a great deal of insurance against the downside, provided that the language doesn’t preclude further timely action as we have been using the word “timely.”  So regarding paragraph 4, my preference is for language that, first, serves to signal that the Committee is fully aware of the situation and not behind the curve, a signal that’s reassuring and confidence enhancing, and, second, preserves our nimbleness, our flexibility, meaning that it doesn’t preclude any options to respond to developments, including further moves and intermeeting actions.  I think the straightforward phraseology “downside risks to growth remain” as opposed to what was suggested in alternative A, which included “may well,” is preferable because the alternative A language strikes me as a bit too clever and risks appearing out of touch.  I also think that repetition of the “in a timely manner” language from the January 22 statement preserves the options to move in an intermeeting action if necessary.  So I think alternative B language is acceptable because it is spare, straightforward, and familiar, and it’s the least likely to confuse the markets in the near term.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Thank you. President Yellen" is simply expressing gratitude towards President Yellen.


Passage number 271.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B in the Bluebook.  If we cut the federal funds rate a further 50 basis points today, we will have done a lot in just a week and a half, but I think these actions do represent an appropriate response to a substantial deterioration in economic conditions.  As I said in my comments on the economic situation, I basically agree with the Greenbook forecast for this year and perceive the risks to be to the downside.  With the fiscal package, a funds rate of 3 percent will likely promote growth in the second half of this year that’s moderate after a brush with recession in the first half.  I’m comfortable with this action because I believe our inflation objective is credible, and I do have confidence that we will be able to reverse the accommodation we’re putting in place when it’s appropriate to do so.  But our discussion does highlight the important point that alternative B seems to be appropriate monetary policy in the context of the modal forecast.  It just brings the real funds rate down to the Greenbook estimate of neutral, around 1 percent.  If the economy were to go into a recession, additional easing would be needed and would be appropriate.  Also, as Governor Kohn and others have emphasized, alternative B still doesn’t seem to incorporate much of anything for insurance against recession.  So, indeed, there is a case for doing more than B.  There is a case for A, but I wouldn’t go there today.  I think we can wait, and I think we can watch as developments unfold and monitor data. With respect to language, the skew in the risks toward a downside surprise and the possible need for insurance against that possibility, especially if we see some further deterioration in financial conditions—that strongly inclines me toward the assessment of risk sentences in alternative B with their asymmetry toward ease.  We need to be absolutely clear, to state clearly today, that we recognize the continued existence of downside risk and communicate that we stand ready to cut further if necessary.  Therefore, I would definitely retain the sentence in alternative B, paragraph 4, that states, “However, downside risks to growth remain.”  However, I could see a case, following President Plosser’s suggestion, to substitute the wording from the last sentence of the December 11 statement to the wording in the last line in alternative B.  That is, we could substitute the words “will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth” for the words “will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.”  This seems to me to be a small change that would, taken together with the new first sentence in paragraph 4, slightly dial down the perceived odds of further cuts relative to the proposed wording in B.  Even without the change that President Plosser suggested, though, the fact that we have added the new first sentence in paragraph 4 does seem to me to change the wording of the assessment of risk enough relative to our intermeeting statement to communicate to markets that we will view future policy moves after the one today somewhat differently going forward.  Today’s move and the intermeeting move are essentially catch-up, to put us where we think we need to be, and moves going forward will respond to the evolution that we see in the markets.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Evans.


Passage number 274.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor 50 basis points today.  I think that a 3 percent funds rate may be reasonably positioned for the economy given our forecast.  That’s the Greenbook path assumption.  That certainly seemed reasonable, and today’s data gave us no indication that reasonably changed that path.  I, like President Geithner, did find it remarkable that risk-management paths were not really that different either way.  Now, surely risks abound, and it’s tough to capture that in models, and I’m all in favor of humility.  I just don’t know which direction humility argues for in this case—more action or less action.  Anyway, those are my preferences.  We have talked a good bit about the potential of reversing our policy action sooner than we often have done in the past.  I just think that it’s going to be difficult in the moment.  The Bluebook path that I’ve been looking at has this reversal starting when the unemployment rate is peaking.  I think it’s unknowable that it is actually the peak.  There will be a lot of uncertainty, but still, that’s the situation that we face, and so I sort of accept that.  But because of that, I would prefer to be a little more careful about how far down we go.  Three percent could be the bottom of a funds rate cycle.  It’s very difficult to know.  From here on out, I’d like to be hopeful for positive news but mindful of further deterioration that we would certainly act on. In terms of the statement, I guess from some discussions over the weekend, I wasn’t expecting to hear much movement in that.  But the suggestions of President Plosser and President Yellen seem to make a lot of sense from my standpoint.  So I think it would be nice if there were a little more discussion of that, and I thought President Poole’s suggestion on inflation was also helpful.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

Passage number 276.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our Vice Chairman urges humility.  I strongly support that.  I agree with President Evans that it’s not obvious that the greater one’s humility, the greater one should favor ease.  I think we should be humble about the path of inflation going forward, whether it’s likely to fall on its own.  I think we should be humble about our understanding of the output gap.  I think we should be humble about whether that’s even a sensible way to think about how real and monetary phenomena interact.  The Phillips curve itself embodies a relationship.  It is uncertain, but it embodies expectations of our future behavior.  I think we should be humble about what those expectations are in the present circumstance.  Times in the past when we’ve gotten in trouble on inflation have often been when we were oversolicitous about weak economic growth, and I think we should be humble about whether we’ve completely gotten past those inflation dynamics or not.  I think we should be humble about the willingness of our future selves to reverse course, and a lot has been said about that.  For some it seems to counsel greater ease now, but I think the opposite argument can be made that the extent to which we think we may be hindered or feel impeded in raising rates, even if we think it’s warranted in the future, should cause us to be more cautious about lowering rates now.  It always seems in recoveries that there’s always something that looks fragile, that looks likely to threaten economic growth.  You know, one month it will be the commercial paper market and CDO writedowns, and this month it’s monolines.  There will be headwinds.  I predict we’ll be talking about headwinds a fair amount in the next couple of years.  But if those are genuinely going to impede us, we need to be realistic about that, and I think we need to take it on board now.  I agree with President Poole.  We need to be humble about our ability to prevent a recession.  I think we should also be humble about the extent to which what we see in terms of both growth and financial markets is presumptively inefficient and needs remedial action on our part.  You spoke several meetings ago, I think a year or two ago, Mr. Chairman, about our need to retain a concern about inflation but not be seen as inflation nutters.  I think we need to care about financial fragility but not be fragility nutters.   If left to my own devices, I could have chosen a 25 basis point cut today.  I recognize that would surprise markets, but judging from the policy paths that you all have submitted for your projections, a whole lot of us think that we’re going to have to surprise markets some time in the year ahead.  Having said that, I can support a 50 basis point cut now.  But more broadly I think inflation is just going to have to keep influencing our policy path.  I don’t think that episodes of weakness in real growth mean that we put part of our mandate aside.  I think it has to temper the extent to which we lower rates and temper our behavior on the other side as well.  As for semantic tactics, I support President Plosser’s suggestion, seconded by President Yellen, and I support President Poole’s suggestion as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement with several other individuals and supports their suggestions.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude to President Stern.


Passage number 278.
 MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We had a fairly extended discussion yesterday about concerns about the condition of various financial markets and some financial institutions and their implications for the economic outlook, and I certainly share those.  In this environment, I favor alternative B—a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target.  My own forecast is below the Greenbook forecast for this year and next, and so my guess is that we’re going to wind up moving further before we’re done.  But that said, I don’t have enough confidence in my forecast to advocate that we do more right now. As far as language of alternative B is concerned, I am certainly happy in general with what we have as written, and I share President Hoenig’s view, although perhaps for a different reason, that the less we say about inflation right now, the better.  The reason is that, in some sense, we haven’t adequately expressed to at least some market participants that we understand where the risks lie right now.  In trying to remind people that we are not inflation nutters but are serious about maintaining price stability, we’ve kind of garbled our message, in my opinion, and I think people in the marketplace know this central bank is committed to price stability.  I don’t think we have to remind them with every statement.  Thank you.

Passage number 282.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B for several reasons, not least of which because it actually seems to reasonably capture what we talked about yesterday.  So I think it has that benefit.  To state the obvious, we are in a very tough spot.  There are clearly risks on both sides of the mandate, and for folks who are of differing opinions, I don’t think that they would either deny the tough spot we’re in or say that we have a lack of worries on either side.  I think President Geithner said in the Q&A at the beginning of this round that we’re choosing which policy error we’re prepared to make or, more charitably, we’re deciding where our worries are the greatest.  It does strike me that alternative B does that reasonably well.  To step back for just a minute, I think that the tough spot we’re in is a function of issues that were very long in the making and will take a long time to work out.  That probably has two implications.  First, as to what Governor Kohn said, it’s easy for me to feel more comfortable with our judgment by saying that we’ll be able to undo it really, really soon; but if it is going to take a long time for this to work out, I don’t want to take any false comfort in that.  The other implication is that, when I say that this is long in the making, I mean particularly for financial institutions.  It has taken them a long time to dig themselves into this hole for the credit-intermediation process to be as deeply disturbed as I take it to be at this point.  So when I think about what policies we would make on the monetary policy front, I wouldn’t want to excuse or somehow allow them to get off scot-free; by going with alternative B, I don’t think that would be the case.  Financial institutions have far more work to do than we have yet to do on monetary policy.  I think they are further from recognizing where they need to get.  That will take some time. In listening to other people’s perspectives on the elixir of a 3 percent fed funds rate, I think it would be a nice luxury to give 3 percent a chance, but it’s probably not practical for the following reasons.  I have tried to convince myself that the monetary policy moves in the last nine or ten days were a one-time step-function change, by which we were setting a level based on where we think the real economy is, and we need to get back to normal monetary policymaking.  I think dropping the word “appreciable” as in alternative B is one way to do so.  The goal would be for monetary policy to get back to sort of normal business in tough times.   Another point, just of commentary, is that, by taking this action along the lines of alternative B, it would be nice if we weren’t going to be lowering the value implied by the markets of where the rate will end up.  So my support of alternative B is nonetheless with this worry as well—that the markets might think that we have more-dramatic actions and that we will have to go lower longer than is currently implied.  I don’t mean to give them additional credit there, but I don’t think that we have a great alternative.  As to the point about market expectations, I would note that we will—and necessarily at some level should—during the course of our next several meetings disappoint market expectations, and that is not something I think we need to run from.  I think that will be part of the discipline function, but this is probably not the right time to do it. As a final point, alternative B is consistent with the narrative that we’ve started based on the data we saw in mid-December, based on the Chairman’s speech earlier this month, and based on our meetings over the past several weeks.  It strikes me that it would be prudent at this time of financial stability risks and uncertainty in the markets for us not to add volatility—not to throw out a different nuance or try to be too clever.  So while I have sympathy for some of the ideas and amendments that have been suggested in this discussion, we’ve come to a pretty tough place, as I said at the outset.  It’s a tough fork in the road.  We should all feel to some degree uncomfortable about the choice we make, but the choice we’re making today needs to be as clear as it can be.  Even if we’d get some comfort in being a little cute, a little clever, and a little nuanced, I’m afraid we might be undoing some of the clear bet that we have to put on the table.  So with that, I support alternative B as written.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses support for alternative B and provides reasons for their support. They also acknowledge the difficult position they are in and the risks involved. They also mention their concerns about the market's interpretation of their actions and the need for stability and clarity in decision making.


Passage number 283.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply consists of two sentences expressing gratitude towards Governor Kroszner.


Passage number 284.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  I also support alternative B.  I think by any measure 125 basis points of easing within a month is a lot and perhaps it is a nearly unprecedented level of insurance that this Committee has purchased in such a short period of time.  But I think it makes sense to have done it in these circumstances because we have the risk of a substantial tightening of credit and financial market conditions.  There are still lots of shoes that may be left to drop and, in Nellie Liang’s great phrase yesterday, “unplanned asset expansions can occur.”  Just today we heard that UBS increased by $4 billion the report of their expected losses from what they reported last month, and that is not their final report.  They’re not going to come out with the final numbers for another month, and so it’s certainly conceivable that more could be there.  The SocGen situation is obviously another thing that is potentially unsettling, and so I think it’s very important to be buying some insurance, particularly when the slow-burn scenario that I’ve talked about for a long time is the one that I see as the most likely.  There is not going to be just some immediate credit crunch or some immediate problem of impairment of capital at an institution.  But just given the increase in the cost of raising capital, given the difficulty of getting things off the books, given that other things have to come on, or given just that the old securitization machines that at a given level of capital sustained a very high level of activity, which can’t be done now because you can’t get the things off the books, the machine can’t churn at the same rate that it did even with the same amount of capital.  Then with all these other challenges, we have to be wary of that.  So the fragility is still there.  As we talked about before, we had some dramatic improvements in October, through early November of last year, and suddenly they reversed, and I just don’t feel comfortable that I understand where those went. That said, however, I think the very recent data that we have gotten provide just a glimmer of hope.  I mean, we’ve had relatively low claims numbers.  The ADP number was relatively low.  I’m not sure how much information content is in that, but with the claims number it makes a not-implausible case that there wouldn’t be a dramatic negative number in the employment report and potentially it could be on the positive side.  I don’t think GDP is quite so miraculous, as we heard the very humble Dave Stockton tell us that they nailed it.  But also look at some of the places in which there was some weakness now that may come up next quarter.  Over the next couple of quarters probably we’re going to see a payback in government spending, whether it’s through direct stimulus or through more expenditures on the military.  The advance durable goods number, which no one really mentioned, was on the positive side.  I don’t want to put too much weight on that, but it suggests that there are at least some mixed signals going forward.  So I think that means that we need to leave our options open.  We need to worry about those downside risks, but we shouldn’t dismiss the possibility that the forecast that Dave and the team have put out not only has nailed it for this quarter but also has not done such a bad job for the quarters going forward.   That means we have to think a lot about what we want to say in the statement.  How do we get that balance right.  Clearly, it’s important that we take out the word “appreciable,” and the markets will see that.  The concern that President Fisher raised is a real one.  If we continue to talk about “appreciable risks” after 125 basis points of cutting in a month, I think that would be unsettling to market participants.  But I think the markets are expecting us to take that back.  Actually if I could just for a moment get clarification from President Yellen.  My understanding was that what she suggested about the change to the fourth paragraph and the assessment of risk was to change only the last sentence back to the December 11 statement.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 287.
 MS. YELLEN.  He proposed, as I recall, changing two sentences, eliminating the one that referred to downside risks and also changing the last sentence.  I would not want to see the downside risk sentence eliminated; I would change only the very last sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Yellen disagrees with the proposal to eliminate the sentence that refers to downside risks.


Passage number 288.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Yes, I would agree that I would not want to see that sentence changed.  I’m open to the possibility of simply changing the last sentence to go back to December 11.  Now, that clearly would be taken by the market as a signal that we were moving back. Another proposal that has been put on the table is to add something about inflation concerns or acknowledgement of the inflation situation in the rationale, starting off with something like “although inflation pressures remain.”  I’d probably end up coming down with President Stern on that—at this point, I’m not sure we gain that much by saying that.  That is something we may need and want to say the next time that we undertake a policy action.  I’m not sure it’s necessary to do so now, although if there were a strong desire to say something like “although inflation pressures remain,” I would not be opposed to that.  But I do think it might be reasonable to at least consider moving back to the December 11 formulation for the last sentence of paragraph 4, but that’s certainly a step back.  I don’t think that closes off options for us going forward, but I’m certainly open to those concerns because I don’t want to close those options off. Finally, on the broader issue of communications, particularly with respect to reversals, something that worries me is that there has been a lot of discussion about Japan.  After they would provide more liquidity or a rate cut, they would say, “Well, we really didn’t want to do that, and we’re going to take this back as soon as we can.”  So they kept providing more and more liquidity, and it had less and less effect.  It was the classic pushing on a string.  I think that shows the very important role of expectations.  So at this point, given that I think we want to leave our options open, I don’t think we want to be emphasizing that.  It’s extremely healthy for us to be discussing that internally, but until we see how things play out, I’m not sure it’s wise to do that because we could really undermine the effectiveness of our monetary policy actions.  That is the last thing we want to do because that might force us to go down further than we would otherwise like and cause more volatility in the markets, more uncertainty with more potential for unanchoring expectations.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 289.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It consists of a polite greeting and expression of gratitude.


Passage number 290.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Poole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple expression of gratitude from President Poole.


Passage number 291.
 MR. POOLE.  Just very quickly, given the number of people who have talked about reversals, it seems to me that the minutes need to say something about it because the minutes have to be true to the ultimate transcript as published.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting that the minutes should include information about reversals, indicating a need for accuracy and completeness in the minutes.


Passage number 292.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "Vice Chairman" does not indicate any conflicting opinions or contrasting statements. It is simply a designation or title without any inherent disagreement.


Passage number 293.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just say that I am completely comfortable with the way you just framed the case, not just for thinking about and talking about strategies for how we take this back at the appropriate point, but I also don’t have any problem with the way you talked about how you’d frame it in public.  I thought that was fine.  When I talked about the need for humility, it was just in our capacity to design optimal strategies for the timing and the slope of the path to reversal at this stage.  I think it’s going to require more time. A few things about the policy action and the statement.  Obviously I support 50, and I support the language in alternative B, paragraph 4, as written.  The Chairman laid out in public earlier this month a basic strategy that said that policy would be directed at providing an adequate degree of insurance against the downside risks, given the nature of those risks.  It was said with more nuance and eloquence, but basically that was the thrust of the strategy.  I think that the balance of evidence we have—even with all the uncertainty about what equilibrium is, what the appropriate level of the real rate is, and what it actually is—suggests that we have not gotten policy to that point.  Therefore, getting that strategy in place is likely to require further action.  It’s very hard to know when or how much.  It’s very hard to know what should frame that choice now for us, I think.  As many of you said, markets have to go through a further set of adjustments, and I think that has to work through the system.  Our job, again, is not to artificially interfere with that process or to substitute our judgment for what the new equilibrium should be in that context.  Our job should be to make sure that adjustment happens without taking too much risk that it tips the financial system and the economy into a much more perilous state that would be harder for us to correct and require much more policy response.  There’s a big difference between a world in which housing prices fall 20 percent and one in which they fall 40.  If everybody thinks they have to prepare for a world in which they fall 40, we’re going to take much greater risk that we have a scale of financial trauma and credit crunch that would produce the odds of a deeper recession. What we face now is not the choice, as I think President Poole said, between a mild recession now and higher-than-expected inflation over time.  The risk we face, as the Chairman said several times, is the choice between a mild, short recession and a deeper, more protracted outcome.  The scale of financial market fragility we now face, you could even say solvency in parts of the financial system, is a function of the confidence we create in our willingness to get policy to a point that provides meaningful protection against an adverse outcome.  I think the experience of the past five or six meetings suggests that we cannot carefully enough design a message that can lean against expectations in the market about the likely path of policy that we judge to be excessive and that makes us uncomfortable without taking too much risk that it will just undermine confidence in our willingness to get policy right.  We just don’t have that capability.  We thought about it and tried it in lots of different ways, but everything we experienced over the past four months justifies the judgment that we can’t lean against those expectations without taking too much risk that we undermine confidence in our capacity to get policy to the point at which we’re giving some insurance. It would be a mistake to try to recalibrate expectations now relative to the stance of policy as stated in the Chairman’s statement and our statement last week.  It would be a mistake to recalibrate back to a point that looks more like October.  Everything we know suggests that it’s probable that the data will get still worse from here and that the financial markets will be in a state of considerable fragility and tenuousness for some time.  To sort of zig at this meeting, to recalibrate more toward a sense of balance in the face of that reality, just means that we’re likely to have to zag back again.  I just think that would risk our looking as though we’re ambivalent and have to correct again because of that.  That would just be uncomfortable.  It’s hard to know—I think Governor Kroszner said it right in many, many meetings—whether we face the risk of a grinding, downward, self-reinforcing set of pressures on balance sheets that raises the risk of deeper trough in housing and creates more caution and deleveraging and the economy moves slowly down or whether we face the risk of much more acute cliffs in asset prices with much greater consequences for confidence and the fragility of the financial system.  It is hard to know, but I think both would be very uncomfortable for us. Again, I strongly support the language in B as it is.  Even though I understand the rationale, I’d be very uncomfortable with dialing back that statement as it now exists to something that suggests we’re closer to balance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and support for the Chairman's framing of the case and the policy action. They also express their belief that further action may be needed in the future.


Passage number 294.
 MS. DANKER.  Yes.  The vote is on the language for alternative B as it is in the Bluebook and in Brian’s handout and on the directive from the Bluebook, which I will read. “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating the language and directive from the Bluebook.


Passage number 295.
” Chairman Bernanke   Yes Vice Chairman Geithner  Yes President Fisher   No Governor Kohn   Yes Governor Kroszner   Yes Governor Mishkin   Yes President Pianalto   Yes President Plosser   Yes President Stern   Yes Governor Warsh   Yes  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  We’ll take just a very quick recess for the Governors to meet, and then we’ll come back for our presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individuals mentioned are all expressing agreement by saying "yes." They are likely indicating their agreement with a proposal or decision being discussed before the recess.


Passage number 296.
 [Meeting recessed] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Let’s reconvene.  We have a special presentation on policy issues raised by financial crisis.  Let me turn to Pat Parkinson to introduce the presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply indicates that the meeting was temporarily paused and is now resuming with a presentation on policy issues raised by a financial crisis. Pat Parkinson is mentioned as the individual responsible for introducing the presentation.


Passage number 297.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there questions for Pat.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply asks if there are any questions for Pat and mentions President Lacker, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 298.
 MR. LACKER.  You characterized underwriting as weak, and I guess the document circulated had some heavy criticism for the credit rating agencies.  I want to understand more what the nature of that assessment involves.  Basically is it ex post regret, or do we have objective evidence about the quality of the decisionmaking ex ante.  That evidence, of course, would involve assessments of the probability they should have placed on things we saw.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is simply describing a question being asked by Mr. Lacker, there is no contention or disagreement present.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 299.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Mike is going to address that in his briefing.  I guess I’d prefer to delay and just simply say that I think we can point to aspects of their methodology that look fairly weak so that it wasn’t simply an ex post result but one that should have been foreseen at least to a degree if they had had a stronger methodology ex ante.  Obviously that’s Monday morning quarterbacking, but still you can point to specific things that were weaknesses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage reveals a disagreement or contention as the speaker expresses their preference to delay and criticizes the methodology used by someone else. They also mention specific weaknesses in the methodology.


Passage number 300.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple response to a statement or question.


Passage number 301.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I would need more context or the specific passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the statement about President Poole.


Passage number 302.
 MR. POOLE.  I have a question on exhibit 2, the top right corner:  Are those AAA examples rated as of January 1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about a specific exhibit.


Passage number 303.
  MR. PARKINSON.  I think that was the rating at origination.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion on a specific topic but there is no opposing view presented.


Passage number 304.
 MR. POOLE.  At origination, not afterward.  Okay.  The other question I have is really a comment.  On exhibit 1, the middle panel, it seems to me something that needs to be explored here, given that this is not the first time that banks have made a lot of bad bets, is the way in which the management incentives are designed.  I just get the impression—and there has been some stuff in the paper recently, the Wall Street Journal or somewhere—that a lot of people are really given incentives to push these products and to make these deals.  They walk away with big bonuses, and who in the heck cares what happens some time later.  So I think that the management incentives are something very important to investigate in order to have an idea of how that works, and we might be of some assistance in designing something that would be helpful here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Poole expressing a suggestion and his belief that exploring management incentives is important.


Passage number 305.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply mentions the title or position of President Hoenig without presenting any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 306.
 MR. HOENIG.  Yes.  Your exhibit 4 and your risk-based capital ratios, fourth quarter, are those as of December 31.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 307.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The word "Yes" is a response to a statement or question, indicating agreement or confirmation.


Passage number 308.
 MR. HOENIG.  Okay.  And do these reflect losses already taken in capital rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating information in a straightforward manner.


Passage number 309.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Yes.  They reflect the developments in terms of the changes in their financial statements during the fourth quarter until the year-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the reflection of developments in financial statements during a specific time period.


Passage number 310.
 MR. HOENIG.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the given statement. It simply conveys gratitude for something.


Passage number 311.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you have a question, President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a direct question with no indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 312.
 MS. YELLEN.  I wanted to support President Poole’s comment.  I remember very well back at Jackson Hole in 2005 that Raghuram Rajan presented a paper in which he emphasized the misalignment of incentives between investors and managers and the fact that almost everyone down the line right up to the investors themselves should have had incentives here.  I don’t know what they were thinking, but everybody was rewarded for the quantity and not the quality of originations.  He warned us before any of this happened that this could come to no good, and I think he did have some suggestions about compensation practices.  These were not popular suggestions.  So I think this is worth some thought.  I don’t know what the answer is in terms of changing these practices.  Maybe the market will attend to them, but it seems to me that we have had an awful lot of booms and busts in which this type of incentive played a role.  Your presentation and the paper started from the fact that you note the deterioration in underwriting, but we should go one step backward.  I suppose another issue here is what we saw in our supervision and whether we acted appropriately given what we saw.  That raises a number of issues that I won’t go into at the moment but that I think we need to be sensitive to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Yellen, is suggesting that there were warning signs and the misalignment of incentives played a role in the financial crisis, but she doesn't know what the answer or solution is. This statement implies a disagreement or lack of consensus on how to address the issue of incentive alignment and compensation practices.


Passage number 313.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no mention or indication of any contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement about President Rosengren is missing important context or additional information to determine any potential contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 314.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a question on exhibit 4, the bottom two panels.  You have the four banks there, and when you look at the capital ratios, it doesn’t look that discouraging.  But when I look at the credit default swaps, it looks a little less encouraging.  So if I put Wachovia on this, I believe Wachovia’s credit default swaps now are up to 166, which would be much higher than your scale is right now.  So it would be interesting actually to add Wachovia to that list.  The second thing is what you take from the fact that the capital ratios don’t look so bad but the credit default swaps and what the markets are looking at indicate that, in the past month and a half, people—despite the capital infusions—are actually exhibiting more concern about the default experiences that might occur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that the capital ratios of the four banks mentioned don't look discouraging, but points out that the credit default swaps indicate higher concern. This suggests a disagreement between the two sets of data and the perception of the situation.


Passage number 315.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Right.  Well, particularly with respect to developments in the last month or two, obviously the economic outlook is cloudier.  As you know, I don’t think we try to reflect that fully in the capital ratios, and there is an element of stress testing and whatnot, but your other important effects are essentially looking through the cycle.  So that may be part of it.  Also, if you look at the credit default swap spread behavior compared with that for lots of other financial intermediaries out there, these look like very modest changes.  I don’t know—if Mike or someone could help me out—to what extent these would translate into significant increases in actual implied default probabilities, but I wouldn’t think it would be all that large an increase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and seeking clarification, but there is no clear indication of disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 316.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The phrase "Vice Chairman" does not provide enough context to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 317.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you.  I agree with President Poole and President Yellen about the need to focus on compensation structures and incentives, but just two observations.  One is that, if you look at compensation practices among the guys who actually look as though they did pretty well against those who didn’t do so well—I’m not talking about in a mortgage-origination sense but in the major global financial institutions—the structure of compensation doesn’t vary that much.  What varies a lot is how well people control for the inherent problems in the basic compensation structures.  Remember Raghu’s presentation was mostly about hedge fund compensation, and I think he is mostly wrong when you think about that and the incentive structure.  The difference really is how you design your limits to make sure that your traders’ incentives are more aligned with the incentives of the firm as a whole.  The biggest errors and differences are in the design of the process of the checks and balances to compensate for the inherent problems in the compensation structure.  That’s important to know because a lot of these things, if you look at the formal attributes of the risk-management governance structure across these firms, don’t look that different.  What distinguishes how well the guys did is much more subtle around culture, independence, and the quality of judgment exercised at the senior level, and this is important because, when you think about what you can do through supervision and regulation, to affect that stuff is hard. I have a question for Pat.  Pat, not to overdo this, but where do you put in your diagnosis of contributing factors the constellation of financial conditions that prevailed during the boom and what those did to housing prices.  You know, there’s a tendency for everybody to look at regulation and supervision and the incentives that they have created or failed to mitigate, but there is a reasonable view of the world that you wouldn’t have had the pattern of underwriting standards of mortgages without the trajectory of house prices that occurred.  Sure, maybe what happened in the late stage of the mortgage-origination process contributed to the upside, but if you look at a chart, the rate of house-price appreciation started to decelerate about the time you had the worst erosion in underwriting practices.  Anyway, my basic question is, Where do you put the constellation of financial conditions, not so much just what the Fed was doing but what was happening globally that affected long rates, expectations of future rates, et cetera.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 318.
 MR. PARKINSON.  Well, partly what I would say, in general, about the pricing of risk is that many, many people, including people in the Federal Reserve, were concerned about how narrow spreads were, were concerned about some of the slippage of practices, and were predicting that trouble lay ahead.  But—and I’m certainly speaking for myself—I never expected this magnitude of trouble.  What I’ve been focusing on are some of the factors that essentially made a bad situation much worse than we expected it to be.  But there is no question that we entered the period with risk being priced very cheaply and a fundamental reassessment of risk.  Again, I think that shouldn’t have surprised anyone, but almost everyone except the most extreme pessimists has been surprised by just how much trouble that repricing of risk has caused.  Some things that we have focused on certainly were not anticipated, and we think they made the situation markedly worse than we expected it to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there were concerns about the narrow spreads and practices in the financial market, and that many people, including those in the Federal Reserve, predicted trouble ahead. The speaker also admits that they did not expect the magnitude of the trouble that occurred. Overall, the passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 319.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there other questions for Pat.  Okay.  We can continue the presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement and does not involve any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 320.
  MS. HIRTLE.  Mike has described how the rating agencies treated structured-credit products; a closely related issue is how investors used these ratings.  Did investors rely too much on ratings in making their investment decisions.  Did they take false comfort from ratings and not really appreciate the risks they were assuming, leading to excessive growth of the market for subprime structured credit.  As noted in the top panel of exhibit 7, our approach was to examine these questions through the lens of one representative type of institutional investor:  public pension funds.  Public pension funds are an informative example of investor use (and misuse) of credit ratings for several reasons.  First, public pension boards of directors are composed largely of representatives of the employees and retirees covered by the pension plan and have only limited financial expertise in some cases.  Second, survey evidence suggests that a high portion of these funds use credit ratings in their investment guidelines.  Finally, relative to some other investors, many public pension funds provide significant public information about their activities.  While we need to be cautious in generalizing, we believe that practices in the pension fund sector reflect the tensions faced by other institutional investors in making risk assessments and investment decisions.  We examined the investment practices and fund governance of 11 public pension plans.  These plans ranged from the largest fund—CalPERS, with $250 billion in assets—to six much smaller plans with assets of $6 billion to $11 billion.  We used the funds’ 2006 comprehensive annual financial reports, which were generally the most recent available, and the funds’ websites to generate our information.  We focused specifically on the funds’ fixed-income segments, since this is the asset class in which structured-credit products would likely be held and for which credit ratings are used. The middle panel lists some key conclusions from this review.  The first is that these funds have developed workable market solutions to address inexperience or lack of financial sophistication among their managers and board members.  These include hiring professional investment managers to make investment decisions on their behalf and, perhaps as significantly, hiring investment consultants to structure asset-allocation strategies, to select investment managers and develop mandates guiding their actions, and to monitor and assess fund performance.  While these funds clearly obtain significant professional advice in managing their investments, our review suggests several ways in which these arrangements could be improved in light of recent financial innovation.  Specifically, the mandates guiding investment managers have not always kept pace with the growth of structured-credit markets.  These mandates typically require managers to meet or exceed returns on a benchmark index or of a peer group of investment managers, while constraining the risk the managers may assume.  Credit ratings play an important role in these risk constraints—for instance, by imposing a minimum average rating for the portfolio or a minimum rating on individual securities.  However, few of the funds we profiled made significant distinctions between structured-credit and other securities in these credit-rating-based constraints, although there were sometimes other limits on the aggregate share of asset-backed positions.  The failure to make this distinction provides scope for investment managers to generate higher returns by moving into structured-credit products, without raising warning signals about the additional risk these positions entail.  This is not necessarily a “naïve” use of credit ratings by investment managers, as they could well have recognized that higher-yielding structured-credit products embodied significant additional risk relative to similarly rated corporate debt.  Instead, it reflects a previously effective mechanism used by fund boards to convey risk appetite to these managers falling out-of-date with the emergence and rapid growth of a new form of credit instrument.   As indicated in the bottom panel, our key recommendation is that the pension fund industry and other investors should re-evaluate the use of credit ratings in investment mandates.  In a narrow sense, these mandates should distinguish between ratings on structured credit and those on more traditional corporate credit.  However, the more fundamental point is that mandates would do a better job of enforcing desired risk limits on the overall portfolio if they acknowledged differences in risk, return, and correlation across instruments rather than relying on generic credit ratings.  A second important point is that investors should ensure that their investment consultants have independent views of the quality and adequacy of credit ratings for the types of positions in their portfolios.  This is particularly important if mandates guiding investment manager behavior feature credit ratings as a key risk constraint.  That completes our prepared remarks.  We would be happy to take your questions before we proceed to the final presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

In this passage, there is contention or disagreement regarding the use of credit ratings by investors. The author suggests that investors may have relied too much on ratings and not fully appreciated the risks they were assuming, leading to excessive growth in the market for subprime structured credit. However, the author also argues that investment managers may have recognized the additional risks associated with structured-credit products and used credit ratings as a mechanism to generate higher returns without raising warning signals about the risk. The author recommends re-evaluating the use of credit ratings in investment mandates and ensuring that investment consultants have independent views of the quality and adequacy of credit ratings.


Passage number 321.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Questions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions the presence of questions and President Lacker, but does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 322.
 MR. LACKER.  I am still confused.  How much of these weaknesses would have been identified by an impartial observer in January 2006, say, without knowledge of what has happened since then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing confusion and asking a question about the identification of weaknesses by an impartial observer in January 2006.


Passage number 323.
 MR. GIBSON.  Are you talking about the credit rating agency weaknesses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is a simple question asking for clarification about credit rating agency weaknesses.


Passage number 324.
   MR. LACKER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, I cannot provide an answer for this question as it requires understanding the context and content of the passage, which is not provided.


Passage number 325.
 MR. GIBSON.  There are plenty of investors who said, “We are staying out of that ABS CDO market because we don’t trust the ratings and we don’t think we have an ability to model it.”  But there are also enough who were willing to take on that risk.  So I think it is a combination.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents two different perspectives on the ABS CDO market but does not express any disagreement or argument between them.


Passage number 326.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage based solely on the provided information, as the passage only states "President Fisher" without providing any context or surrounding details.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 327.
 MR. FISHER.  Going back to exhibit 5, the second panel, your point that we have no evidence of conflicts of interest having an effect on ratings, I am thinking about the investor-practices presentation.  There is an inherent conflict of interest because the issuers pay the raters.  By one account, Moody’s earned 44 percent of their revenue in 2006 from rating structured products.  I have always wondered—and by the way, I have been on the side of the table that has worked a rating agency and have gotten what I wanted—what about just a common sense solution, which is that the investors rather than the issuers pay the rating agencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is expressing disagreement with the point that there is no evidence of conflicts of interest influencing ratings. He suggests a different approach where investors, rather than issuers, pay the rating agencies in order to mitigate the conflict of interest.


Passage number 328.
 MR. GIBSON.  That used to be the way it was before 1970—the investors paid.  I think the common explanation for why that model faded was that, once photocopy machines came into existence, there was no way to constrain the information that they were providing just to subscribers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a widely accepted explanation for the fading of a certain model.


Passage number 329.
   MR. FISHER.  I am well aware of that.  But is there an inherent conflict of interest in the process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 330.
 MR. GIBSON.  There is.  We are not denying that there is a conflict of interest.  We looked at some of the mechanisms that rating agencies have put in place to address conflicts of interest, and that is something that every rating agency is aware of.  The only question is whether the mechanisms that are in place to address conflicts of interest were working or whether they need to be enhanced.  Our conclusion was that we don’t really have the detailed information to know whether there were specific conflicts of interest, and we are looking to the SEC to provide that detailed information.  But lots of other things seemed to go wrong with the rating agencies that don’t rely on conflicts of interest as an explanation.  I think people who have looked at the question of the issuer’s paying versus the investor’s paying feel that, given how costly it is to rate these things even in the mediocre way that it has been done, it would be difficult to generate enough revenue through a pure investor-pay model.  That is not to say there couldn’t be more competition between the two kinds, and there are some proposals out there to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The passage acknowledges that there is a conflict of interest but states that there is disagreement on whether the mechanisms in place to address conflicts of interest were effective or need improvement. Additionally, there is mention of differing opinions on the issuer's paying versus the investor's paying model. Therefore, there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 331.
 MR. FISHER.  Again, remember how costly it has proven to investors to have that built-in conflict of interest.  That’s all.  That’s my say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is giving their opinion or perspective and highlighting the potential drawbacks of a built-in conflict of interest for investors.


Passage number 332.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Mishkin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions Governor Mishkin without stating any statements or actions that might indicate contention or disagreement. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 333.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Actually, I wanted to focus on the same issue—conflict of interest.  This is something I did a little work on in the past.  When you look at the standard corporate ratings market, the move to have the issuer pay really did not create a problem in the market.  There clearly is an inherent conflict of interest, but there are things that can counter that—in particular, reputation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges the presence of a conflict of interest but also highlights that there are factors, such as reputation, that can mitigate its negative effects.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 334.
 MR. FISHER.  Arthur Andersen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage does not provide any information about Arthur Andersen or any disagreement or contention related to it.


Passage number 335.
 MR. MISHKIN.  We could talk about Arthur Andersen, too, because I am going to talk about the more complicated issues of conflicts of interest.  With plain vanilla conflicts of interest, if there is enough information, the market frequently can solve the problem because if you know that if you do what the issuer wants and you give a good rating, then you lose your reputation.  Then, if it has no value, issuers won’t pay for it.  What is interesting here is that for the subprime market, you didn’t find any evidence of conflicts of interest, and I am not surprised by that, because those securities are much more straightforward.  Where I really do worry about the conflict of interest is in the structured products because one thing that happened was that it became less plain vanilla.  You actually had consulting practices inside the credit rating agencies; these structures are very complicated, and you need to slice here and dice here, and consultants were providing advice on structuring them and making a lot of money, and then it was much less transparent.  What I wondered about here is that you didn’t say this for the first one, subprime RMBS.  You said you didn’t find the evidence.  I buy that.  But what about the CDOs and the SIVs, for which I would expect that this problem would have been more severe.  In the book that I wrote with others on conflicts of interest in the financial services industry, we actually said that there was not a problem with the plain vanilla products because the markets have the information, but we worried about exactly this issue in terms of the structured products.  I am just wondering whether or not it was an accident that you said for the plain vanilla that there was less problem.  Could there have been an issue here.  The reason this gets complicated is that the standard view of conflicts of interest in Arthur Andersen was in the firm’s compensation scheme.  Actually, the conflict of interest was that the Texas unit did not worry about and weakened—not their ethics, but what is it.  The center has rules for its branches so that they don’t screw the overall firm, and that is what got weakened during the fight between the consulting part and the auditing part. So do you have any information on these very complicated elements, particularly the nontransparent parts.  Was it an accident that you said for subprime that you didn’t find evidence, and for these is there more possibility that there was a problem.  That really does have important implications for the nature of the regulation and accreditation agencies and also their ability to give good ratings for these very complex nontransparent products.  You talked about investor practices later, Bev, when you said that we should differentiate between plain vanilla and this very complex stuff.  I don’t know whether or not you have views on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for more information on a specific topic and expressing curiosity about why certain evidence was not found. There is no argument or disagreement present.


Passage number 336.
 MR. GIBSON.  There is certainly a possibility that conflicts of interest were occurring in all these areas.  We are taking a somewhat neutral position because we don’t really have the detailed information to say more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker explicitly states that they are taking a neutral position because they lack detailed information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 337.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Right.  But this is the typical Federal Reserve cautiousness, and I am pushing you a little harder.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is some level of disagreement or contention between Mr. Mishkin and the person he is speaking to. Mr. Mishkin is pushing the other person to provide a stronger or more assertive response than the typical cautiousness of the Federal Reserve.


Passage number 338.
 MR. GIBSON.  I know, but I am a Federal Reserve economist.  I would agree with your point that separating out these nonrating businesses from the rating businesses is important, and rating agencies have announced some changes along these lines.  When we looked at our recommendations, we didn’t really feel as though, even if they separated out rating businesses from nonrating businesses and even if they did all the things that people who are concerned about conflicts of interest want them to do, it would solve the problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges the importance of separating nonrating businesses from rating businesses and agrees with the point being made. They also express a shared concern about conflicts of interest.


Passage number 339.
 MR. MISHKIN.  There would still be problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply indicates that there would be problems.


Passage number 340.
 MR. GIBSON.  We think the real problem is that they didn’t differentiate well enough between structured-finance ratings and corporate ratings, and that is where we would like to put the focus.  Securities regulators are already focused on conflicts of interest, and there are codes of conduct regarding how rating agencies have to behave, and those are monitored.  So, coupled with the SEC’s already doing examinations, that wasn’t an area we chose to focus on, but we really can’t say for sure what was going on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their perspective on the problem and where they believe the focus should be. They also mention that securities regulators and codes of conduct are already addressing conflicts of interest and monitoring rating agencies' behavior. The speaker acknowledges that they cannot say for sure what was going on.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 341.
 MR. MISHKIN.  One quick follow-up on that—is one implication that we might take from this that structured products are just so complicated that they may never get good ratings or sufficiently good ratings, so the market really has to shrink.  Could the rating agencies just fix themselves up so that they actually could do decent ratings.  I’m trying to get a feel for this.  It really relates to the issue that Bev raised, which is you want to differentiate between the two.  But is there something inherently problematic so that maybe people should just realize that these structured products are just not such a great thing.  Financial engineering can go too far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting that structured products are so complex that they may never receive good ratings, implying that the market for these products should shrink. However, the speaker also questions whether the rating agencies could improve themselves to provide better ratings for structured products, indicating a disagreement or debate over whether the problem lies with the products themselves or the rating agencies' ability to evaluate them accurately. Additionally, the speaker raises the viewpoint that people should realize that structured products may not be as beneficial as believed, suggesting a potential disagreement over the value or desirability of these products.


Passage number 342.
 MR. GIBSON.  I agree.  In fact, ABS CDOs are disappearing or have disappeared.  Investors don’t have any appetite for them.  SIVs are disappearing as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Gibson, agrees that ABS CDOs and SIVs are disappearing or have disappeared, indicating there is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 343.
 MR. MISHKIN.  But they could come back.  I think subprime lending will come back under a different business model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 344.
 MR. GIBSON.  Really, the question is, What sort of market forces would produce that outcome.  It certainly seems as though things should move in that direction, and we feel that some of the recommendations we are making on the differentiation between structured-finance securities and corporate securities would encourage the rating agencies to put more scrutiny on the structured-finance side of it.  Yes, those ratings should be lower, especially when you factor in things like the complexity and the uncertainty.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It presents the speaker's viewpoint and his belief that certain recommendations could encourage rating agencies to evaluate structured-finance securities more critically. There are no conflicting perspectives or arguments provided.


Passage number 345.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot provide an answer as the passage provided is incomplete.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 346.
 MR. HOENIG.  My comment is on the conflicts of interest as well.  The only thing I would like to add is that this is not the first time the rating agencies have miscalculated the risk and put that out there.  The incentives are designed to do exactly that, and it will occur again.  I think this statement is too generous to the rating agencies.  The incentives are driving them to do this, they did it, and they will do it again in the future.  It is just inherent that, when you are going to make that kind of money and if you can get it down to working with them and pushing this stuff out, it really is a matter, for those who use them, that you get what you pay for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The first statement by Mr. Hoenig acknowledges the conflicts of interest and suggests that this is not the first time rating agencies have made mistakes. However, the second statement disagrees with this, asserting that the statement is too generous to the rating agencies and claims that they intentionally manipulate risk assessments for their financial gain.


Passage number 347.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Poole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 348.
 MR. POOLE.  I didn’t know anything about SIVs before last summer, but I must say when I began to learn something about them, I was astonished because it would seem to me that, in Finance 101, you don’t finance long-term, risky assets with short-dated paper.  There’s a maturity mismatch, and there’s a rollover risk, and we’ve known about that kind of thing for 100 years, I suppose.  So my question is, Could these things have been marketed as standalone entities without the banks’ sponsorship, which was there in, I guess, most cases.  Second, if they wouldn’t really fly as standalone entities, it would seem to me that the regulators should have insisted that they be consolidated on the books of the bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. Mr. Poole is expressing his disbelief and astonishment at the practice of financing long-term, risky assets with short-dated paper and questions whether these entities could have been marketed without the banks' sponsorship. He also suggests that regulators should have insisted on the consolidation of these entities on the banks' books.


Passage number 349.
 MR. GIBSON.  A lot of the SIVs were standalone entities managed by independent asset-management companies that were set up to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the structure of SIVs (structured investment vehicles) being standalone entities managed by independent asset-management companies. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 350.
 MR. POOLE.  And they collapsed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "And they collapsed" is a simple statement of fact.


Passage number 351.
 MR. GIBSON.  All the SIVs are in the process of winding down now, and in the immediate aftermath of what happened in August, that was when there was a crunch in the ABCP market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the status of SIVs and the ABCP market without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 352.
 MR. POOLE.  But when you say the asset-management companies, are they providing at least in principle some liquidity support or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Poole is seeking clarification on whether asset-management companies provide liquidity support.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 353.
 MR. GIBSON.  SIVs had partial liquidity backup lines from banks covering one week’s maximum withdrawal or two weeks’ maximum withdrawal.  That was the way to a rating.  The SIVs were operating under the regulation of the rating agencies.  The rating agencies modeled their portfolios, and they modeled the inflows and outflows, so I think it’s fair to blame the rating agencies at least partially for allowing the SIVs to grow to $400 billion or whatever it was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is attributing partial blame to the rating agencies for allowing the SIVs to grow to a significant amount.


Passage number 354.
 MR. PETERS.  There is a large, independent SIV not affiliated with a bank, named Gordian Knot, that is still in existence.  It’s under severe pressure, but it has been weathering the storm.  One can argue it might have been more conservative than some of the other SIVs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It merely provides information about an independent SIV and suggests that it may have been more conservative than other SIVs.


Passage number 355.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage only mentions Governor Kohn without providing any information about a specific topic or any potential contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 356.
 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question is on exhibit 6, and the question is, Are we making any progress here.  In particular, are the rating agencies stepping up to the process of doing different ratings, different nomenclature for the structured finance.  My impression is that  there is a lot of resistance, at least there was as of a few weeks ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is contention or disagreement regarding whether rating agencies are making progress in implementing different ratings and nomenclature for structured finance. The speaker suggests that there has been resistance from the rating agencies.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 357.
 MR. GIBSON.  Your impression may be more informed than mine, but I would say that the rating agencies are doing a lot of self-examination now.  I haven’t seen them willing, in my opinion, to go far enough in the directions that we’ve outlined.  A lot of their recommendations focus on managing conflicts of interest and doing a better job of separating compensation from the rating and things like that.  I would say that I haven’t seen enough on the sort of recommendations that we are pushing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is disagreement or contention between Mr. Gibson and the rating agencies about the recommendations they should be implementing. Mr. Gibson believes that the rating agencies are not going far enough in the directions that he and others have outlined.


Passage number 358.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Did you have any questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is a simple yes-or-no question and does not indicate any disagreement or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 359.
 MR. WARSH.  I’d add only that I think where the rating agencies are now is trying to come up with cleaner boxes and better governance—Sarbanes-Oxley types of structures, ombudsmen, liaisons, Chinese walls.  The core issues that Mike and his team bring up seem highly resistant to change, but you know, there will be nothing like three months of public hearings, if not hangings.  [Laughter]  That could change that dynamic, but that’s in the early stages.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 360.
 MR. MISHKIN.  Torture works.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The phrase "torture works" suggests that there is a claim being made about the effectiveness of torture. This statement is controversial and can be subject to disagreement and contention, as opinions on the subject of torture can vary.


Passage number 361.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Kroszner.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement mentioned in the passage. The statement "Governor Kroszner" simply identifies a person without providing any information about their views or actions.


Passage number 362.
 MR. KROSZNER.  A few different points.  One, on the conflict of interest issue, with respect to traditional corporate credits, it seems that credit rating agencies do pretty darn well and certainly have done very well before this.  So it’s clear that it’s not just fundamental to the model that it can’t work.  I think it’s clear enough to remind people of that and that people trusted those ratings throughout all the turbulence during the summertime.  But that said, it gets back to some of the other points that have been raised.  What was special about these particular areas that led to a breakdown.  The question is, Well, why did they have bad models.  If they were able to develop good models for these other things, in principle they are capable of developing good models, but they seem to have developed poor models here.  Now, that could be succumbing to a conflict of interest, or it could be something specific in this area. I am reminded that another area in which they are perceived to have done a very poor job was in sovereign ratings back a couple of decades ago.  I don’t know whether it’s worthwhile to drill down into the characteristics of where this model seems to be successful and doesn’t seem to be subject to significant conflicts of interest or where it does, whether it relates to particular information issues.  Also, one thought that I had with respect to these structured products—and you should tell me whether this is true or not—is that most times when a corporation comes to get a rating they’ve decided to issue a particular security—that is, if GM comes, their CFO has decided to issue ten-year debt.  If you come to a credit rating agency, however, the credit rating agency can say, “Well, why don’t you issue six securities rather than one.  If we chop it up in these different ways, I can make more revenues off that, so I have more of an incentive to work with you on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Kroszner expressing his thoughts and raising questions about the credit rating agencies and their models.


Passage number 363.
”   MR. GIBSON.  I definitely agree with you that it’s more difficult to rate structured-finance securities than corporate securities because with structured-finance securities you have a lot of quantitative modeling of future cash flows with a lot of uncertainty.  Clearly the ABS CDOs are very complicated structures because it’s a two-layer securitization—a securitization that invests in securitizations—and the rating agencies didn’t drill all the way down to model the ultimate underlying loans.  They relied on simplifying assumptions and aggregations that were very crude.  But because they were branded as CDOs, people usually understood them to be corporate CDOs that invest in 100 corporate bonds, which is a simpler, one-layer structure.  So the rating agencies were willing to rate these much more complicated things and investment banks were willing to market them to investors who were willing to buy them because they all were willing to believe that a CDO is a CDO is a CDO, and, in fact, that wasn’t really true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply explaining the complexity of rating structured-finance securities compared to corporate securities and discussing the mistaken belief that all CDOs are the same.


Passage number 364.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Yes, it might just be interesting to drill down and see where the successes are and where they haven’t been successful and whether it has something to do with the model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the possibility of analyzing and identifying the successes and failures of a particular model without any opposing viewpoints presented.


Passage number 365.
 MR. GIBSON.  Oh, it’s definitely not a random sample of asset classes that we chose to look at.  The rating agencies have done a great job in many other places, I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 366.
 MR. KROSZNER.  Right, but just thinking about those differences, I think sometimes the rating agencies may be excessively maligned.  They actually do provide something that’s very useful, and we don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water.  But also on that, there is a severe lack of competition among rating agencies, and we’ve tried to address that through some legislation, which doesn’t seem to have been very successful at addressing that issue.  This is getting back to Governor Mishkin’s point and some other points about why competition doesn’t get us to a better solution.  It seems that part of it is a regulatory structure that strongly discourages competition.  Did you think about addressing that issue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no clear contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges the usefulness of rating agencies, but also points out a lack of competition among them and the failure of legislation to address this issue. The speaker then suggests that the regulatory structure may discourage competition. Overall, there is a discussion of different aspects related to rating agencies and competition, but no direct disagreement or contention.


Passage number 367.
 MR. GIBSON.  The regulatory structure has been changed now as a result of the law that was passed in 2006, at least if you’re talking about getting the regulatory stamp of approval from the SEC to become a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  That’s now just a notification process by which, if you meet some minimum requirements, the SEC is required to okay you.  So entry is now easy whereas before it used to be restricted by the SEC.  In some sense there’s a bit of a natural monopoly going on because, if you really had a couple of rating agencies that you trusted, it’s not clear why someone would be willing to transfer from an established to a new one.  But if you were to take some of our recommendations to the next level and talk about how you would actually implement this and how you would go about making this have some success, one thing people have suggested is that maybe we should help investors set up their own rating agencies—maybe they don’t want to do that now—and maybe more transparency from the existing rating agencies and from the issuers.  It would then be easier for a new rating agency that’s funded by investors to get going and get some traction if there were more transparency around the whole process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and discussing potential recommendations for improving the rating agency system.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 368.
  That’s just one possibility MR. KROSZNER.  For sure, although I think we tried something like that with the Sarbanes-Oxley issues of independent research—because this in some sense is a parallel to independent research—and even required funding of that, and that doesn’t really seem to have taken off.  So it seems as though the model, even with its flaws, is the only one that seems to be sustainable.  But drilling down more into where those flaws are, in some sense we’re seeing a privatization—I’m not quite sure what the right word is—with some of the very sophisticated investors effectively building their own internal credit rating agencies.  That’s what hedge funds do, and so you’re getting in some sense a loss of the public rating—a kind of free rider problem or whatever is the right way to characterize it.  In some sense there may be a loss because you’re getting this to be just purely private, but maybe that’s a gain because those are the only guys who should be in this game.  It certainly makes it difficult to sustain the credit rating agency or industry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the current model of credit rating agencies is flawed but still the only sustainable option. However, they also mention the potential issues with private investors creating their own internal rating agencies, leading to a loss of public rating. This suggests a disagreement or debate about the best approach to credit rating agencies.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 369.
 MR. GIBSON.  We have kind of a dual problem in that we want investors to do a better job of evaluating the risks, and maybe better ratings would help on that.  At the same time, the existing rating agencies did a bad job, so we have to criticize them.  We have to find some way to reconcile those.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents two conflicting ideas. On one hand, it suggests that investors need to do a better job of evaluating risks, and better ratings could aid in that. On the other hand, it acknowledges that the existing rating agencies did a bad job, indicating a criticism of their performance. These two ideas need to be reconciled, implying a contention or disagreement.


Passage number 370.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have President Evans for a two-hander and then President Lockhart and President Lacker.  I also see that President Plosser has a two-hander, and I think at that point we should probably go onto the last presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states the order in which different presidents will speak, without any disagreement or contention being expressed.


Passage number 371.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I can pass if it gets too long.  That’s okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 372.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  All right.  So President Evans, President Lockhart, and President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrases "Okay" and "All right" indicate agreement or acceptance.


Passage number 373.
 MR. EVANS.  I had an elementary question that Governor Kroszner’s question kicked off.  The background briefing was very well written and very clear, which made me think that I understood things, and I probably don’t.  But you used the term “get a rating,” and at other times you talk about it as if it’s a sufficient statistic and how the agencies were warned that it’s not a sufficient statistic.  There are transition matrices to downgrade, and yet they violated that themselves because you said that for the ABS, they thought of it as a sufficient statistic themselves.  Is a lot of this inherently a multidimensional risk model that’s required for some of these structured-finance vehicles, whereas for the corporates it’s closer to a single dimensional risk model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Evans expressing his confusion and seeking clarification on the topic being discussed.


Passage number 374.
 MR. GIBSON.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: As there is no context or accompanying information provided in the passage, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement. Therefore, the answer is "I don't know."


Passage number 375.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Thank you" does not contain any content or opinion that could lead to contention or disagreement.


Passage number 376.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 377.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I’d like to ask as a practical matter what weighting we should put in our expectations or even our recommendations on reform of the rating system versus the expectation that investors would actually reduce their reliance on ratings.  My impression is that many institutional investors, especially public pension funds, are notoriously understaffed.  Then they work for, as you pointed out in your presentation, boards that either represent the beneficiaries or in some respects are quite political in nature and not necessarily financially sophisticated.  That would lead me to the conclusion that, as a practical matter, they’re going to be highly reliant on ratings.  The ratio of professional employees to the volume of investment is so low that they have to choose their restaurants by stars because they don’t have time to do the tasting themselves or they’re not given the budgets to do that now.  So I’m curious about this tension between getting the rating system right versus having the investors reduce their reliance on ratings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their viewpoint on the practicality of reforming the rating system versus the expectation that investors would reduce their reliance on ratings. They mention their impression that many institutional investors, particularly public pension funds, are understaffed and not financially sophisticated, which leads them to believe that these investors will continue to heavily rely on ratings. There is no explicit disagreement or contention present in the passage.


Passage number 378.
 MS. HIRTLE.  Well, I think you’ve identified the key problem that many of these funds face, and the important entities in many ways are these investment consultants.  At least the funds we looked at all hire one or more of these investment consultants.  Many of them are from large, globally active firms, and the role that those consultants play is precisely to address the issues that you’ve raised.  They help them select the asset manager who is doing the investing.  They help them design the mandates or instructions.  They help them monitor what the asset managers are doing and assess their performance.  So to some extent those consultants are a kind of sweet spot for these funds in terms of where the additional layer of sophistication that doesn’t run just off the rating could come from.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation and supporting the idea that investment consultants play a crucial role in addressing the key problem faced by these funds.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 379.
 MR. LOCKHART.  But is your impression that those supplemental parties, the consultants and the asset managers themselves, have the credit analysis and valuation capability to address sophisticated structured products.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there may be a disagreement or contention regarding whether the supplemental parties have the required credit analysis and valuation capability for sophisticated structured products. The phrase "is your impression" indicates that there might be differing opinions on this matter.


Passage number 380.
 MS. HIRTLE.  We didn’t do an evaluation of them, but some of them are from very, very large firms.  They are advising funds in the trillions of dollars across all their different clients.  That is the service they are selling, and so they should be—they had better be—in a position to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states a fact about the qualifications of certain professionals without expressing any disagreement.


Passage number 381.
 MR. FISHER.  May I just suggest that you reexamine that proposition.  They usually evaluate performance principally after going through initial screening devices.  They almost never, that I’m aware of, provide the kind of analysis that you’re assuming.  So I would reexamine that proposition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that the proposition be reexamined based on their own perspective and experience.


Passage number 382.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no mention of any disagreement or contention in the passage because it only mentions President Lacker without any context or information about any discussions or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 383.
 MR. LACKER.  My memory of Finance 101 is that you don’t buy long-term, risky assets funded by short debt without sufficient compensation.  So the neglected aspect of the whole episode we went through was how people would have been compensated in other circumstances, but that’s a different discussion.  I think these recommendations make sense, and confirmation of that is that the market is moving in that direction anyway.  I don’t know how many of these recommendations were put forward by those market participants you cited who two years ago were not trusting these ratings—I think that’s a key question.  But the broader thing here is that the world of finance now is a world of competing econometric analysis, and we’re never going to rate the model risk if you ask the question, What would you expect the behavior of a market like that to display.  You’d expect occasional big misses from erring assumptions.  You’d expect those misses to be corrected by people reflecting and improving practices going forward.  A sort of Schumpeterian process in this is going to generate model risk and big model misses, and so I think it’s being careful to keep track of whether the insights we’ve gleaned are hindsight or should have been known ahead of time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 384.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  Why don’t we continue with the final portion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking to continue with the final portion.


Passage number 385.
  MR. ANGULO.  The top panel of exhibit 12 sets forth the question we sought to address—namely, to what extent did regulatory incentives contribute to or fail to mitigate weaknesses exposed by the recent turmoil.  In doing so, we defined the term “regulatory incentives” to encompass both regulatory capital and financial reporting requirements.  In addition, we distinguished between policies that may have mattered for the buildup to the market turmoil and those that have made managing the turmoil more challenging.  Our conclusions are summarized in the middle panel.  Not surprisingly, incentives to minimize regulatory capital are a much more important driver of bank behavior than financial reporting incentives.  Moreover, the current regulatory capital framework is not neutral as to how banks structure risk positions.  Both the leverage ratio and the Basel I risk-based capital framework have encouraged banks to securitize low-risk assets and, importantly, to support securitizations of higher-risk assets through instruments with low mandated capital charges, such as 364-day liquidity facilities.  Financial reporting incentives were not critical to banks’ decisions, although certain financial reporting issues—particularly disclosure practices—have been a factor in how the turmoil has been unfolding.Before I turn to specific recommendations, it is important to emphasize that improvements were already in train even before the market difficulties emerged last summer.  Most significantly, the Basel 2 advanced approaches and related improvements greatly enhance the risk sensitivity of the regulatory capital framework and create incentives for better risk management.  In the bottom panel are three examples relevant to the issues we have been discussing this morning.  First, capital charges for most unused short-term credit and liquidity facilities have been increased to more adequately reflect the risk exposure.  Second, new standards for banks to hold capital against the default risk of complex, less liquid credit products in the trading book are being finalized, as the Basel Committee is currently seeking public comment on principles for calculating a so-called incremental default risk charge against such products.  I should note that the work to develop the incremental default risk principles was done by a joint Basel Committee–IOSCO working group co-chaired by Norah Barger.  Third, the securitization framework in Basel 2, which builds on previous unilateral U.S. enhancements, establishes a more risk-sensitive capital treatment for securitization exposures—it bases capital charges on estimates of underlying risk rather than on an exposure’s legal form.I will now turn to recommendations in exhibit 13, beginning first in the top panel with those related to regulatory capital.  First, notwithstanding the improvements brought about by Basel 2, there is scope for reassessing the treatment of securitizations involving ABS CDOs.  The risk weights and resulting capital charges for these “re-securitizations” were calibrated under the assumption that loss correlations within a pool of securitized assets would be no greater than those exhibited by CDOs backed by traditional corporate bonds.  It is now apparent that the actual loss correlations within such re-securitizations—especially for the most highly rated tranches—may be much higher.  At its December 2007 meeting, the Basel Committee agreed to take up this issue.  The second recommendation addresses the issue of “reputational” risk.  There have been several occasions over the last 6 months in which banks have elected to purchase assets from, or extend credit to, off-balance-sheet vehicles they had organized and money market and other investment funds they managed, even though they were not contractually obligated to do so.  Whether a bank management will provide support in excess of its contractual obligations is a business decision.  Thus, it is not practical to attempt to design an explicit capital charge for reputational risk.  Instead, supervisors should exercise supervisory oversight to ensure that banks sufficiently consider reputational risk and its implications for capital and liquidity buffers.  The third and fourth recommendations deal with the issue of the procyclicality of capital regulations.  The existence of fixed capital requirements (as well as rating agency expectations for capital ratios) discourages banks from drawing on their capital cushions in times of stress.  It is therefore very difficult to devise changes in capital regulations that would allow capital to function more effectively as a shock absorber without compromising safety and soundness objectives.  Nonetheless, these last two recommendations are aimed at mitigating the potential procyclical effects of a more risk-sensitive capital framework.  The third recommendation is based on elements of the Basel 2 framework that were designed to allow supervisors to address both safety and soundness and procyclicality concerns.  The advanced internal ratings based approach of Basel 2 requires that banks’ loss-given-default estimates reflect economic downturn conditions and that stress tests of their advanced systems include consideration of how economic cycles affect risk-based capital requirements.  Rigorous supervisory evaluation of these two elements can help ensure that (1) regulatory capital embeds forward-looking forecasts of recovery rates and (2) banks manage their regulatory capital positions in a manner that enables them to accommodate variations in the amount of minimum required capital over an economic cycle.  The fourth recommendation is to explore ways to encourage inclusion in the regulatory capital base of debt instruments that mandatorily convert into equity when a banking organization is under stress.  The automatic conversion of debt instruments into equity under such circumstances is appealing from a supervisory perspective as well as from a broader macroeconomic policy perspective.  This concept has not yet been examined in depth by the staff, but we believe it merits further study, including an assessment of the past experiences of banks with such instruments, to determine its feasibility.Let’s now move to the recommendations in the bottom panel.  These deal with improving disclosure practices, which can help to reduce the uncertainty that has been a key feature of the recent turmoil.  First, financial institutions—especially those in the United States—improved their disclosures about subprime-related exposures as the turmoil wore on.  Nonetheless, supervisors and regulators should continue to push market participants to make timely and detailed disclosures about the size and composition of subprime-related exposures.  The second and third recommendations focus on disclosures related to asset-backed commercial paper programs.  In view of the potential exposure associated with reputational risk, market participants appear to desire additional details about banks’ dealings with ABCP programs.  Disclosing information about the distribution of assets underlying such programs by type, industry, and credit rating would bring the disclosures on par with those provided for on-balance-sheet assets.  Similarly, in view of the extent to which investors in asset-backed commercial paper have retreated from rolling over or purchasing paper that they suspect may be supported by subprime-related assets, banks and asset managers that sponsor ABCP conduits should improve disclosures to investors, particularly for conduits other than the traditional multi-seller programs.  That completes our prepared remarks.  We would be pleased to take your questions at this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is providing information about regulatory incentives and recommendations for improvements without expressing any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 386.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it consists of a polite expression of gratitude and a request for information.


Passage number 387.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  It is great to see some bank supervision people at this table, and I would just highlight one of the comments that you made about silos.  It is interesting that this morning we have been discussing issues of bank balance sheet constraints and how that would occur, and it might be useful to think structurally within our own organization whether there are ways to do a better job of getting people in bank supervision to understand some of the financial stability issues we think about, and then vice versa.  Maybe having some bank supervision people come to FOMC meetings might be one way to actually promote some of this. In terms of the things that you were talking about, another issue that I think has been important is that we’ve been talking about the effect of dropping housing prices.  I know a horizontal stress review was done about a year ago, and I’m sure Brian or Jon remembers that the large financial institutions did the stress testing.  When they did that stress testing, what was striking was that there were four institutions—I think it was Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wachovia, and Bank of America—in that stress test, and all four concluded that a housing-price reduction of between 10 percent and 20 percent would affect earnings but wouldn’t affect capital.  Obviously, in retrospect that doesn’t seem to have been a good forecast.  One, since we do think that stress testing is useful, maybe understanding that and going back to those same four institutions and understanding their stress testing might be a useful exercise to do.  Two, if you did that exercise, we’d learn something about how they’re thinking about housing prices and the indirect effects that might occur because one of our concerns around the FOMC table is that there may be unintended consequences if housing prices drop more than they have historically.  Just as the banks have to think about those kinds of stress tests and what they have already learned from the fact that they didn’t pick up some of the indirect effects, our own knowledge would be supplemented if we thought about some of those indirect effects as well. So the horizontal stress testing was interesting in that I think some of those institutions are on the good side and the bad side of your things.  The horizontal stress testing isn’t what generated the decisions—and I do agree with your conclusion that most of the decisions were made by senior management.  Some organizations didn’t do subprime mortgages at all.  I’m not so sure it was generated from the stress testing as much as a gut feeling by senior bank management that they weren’t going to engage in subprime mortgages.  I think that’s true for a lot of these activities.  It’s interesting who’s at the top of the list and who’s at the bottom of the list for a lot of these activities.  Ideally, over time, both bank supervision and bank risk management would get to the point that it’s not just a gut decision by a person at the top but is a little more systematic and that the risk-management process does that.  Are you thinking of ways that we could actually encourage that kind of interaction so that it becomes less gut from senior management and more integrated into the risk management.  I know that was kind of a long entry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 388.
 MR. ANGULO.  Well, I would just comment on the first point that you made in terms of silos.  I guess we would fully agree we’re having a great time here, so we would love to see more interaction between supervision and the FOMC.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Angulo is expressing agreement with the first point made about the need for more interaction between supervision and the FOMC.


Passage number 389.
   VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Be careful what you wish for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The phrase "Be careful what you wish for" is a warning that implies caution and consideration rather than expressing any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 390.
   MR. ANGULO.  You know, when people debate whether to have supervision with a central bank or not, one of the key arguments is that only we can bring to bear the resources of the entire central bank and also provide input from the supervision side.  So clearly, that’s something I think we need to do more of.  In terms of the second question, do you want to take a fresh crack at that, Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the speaker's belief in the importance of having supervision with a central bank and the need for more input from the supervision side.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 391.
 MR. PETERS.  Yes.  My perception is that the people who were further down on the list made active decisions to get out of the business or reduce their scale of the business, not necessarily just on gut feeling but because they had invested earlier on in the staff and the models to evaluate the product space.  So they understood that the economics of the subprime business had deteriorated and that the risk relative to the return was rising, and they made an active decision, usually, to retract a bit from that space.  Now, they may have made those decisions gradually and incrementally over the year from mid-2006 forward.  It wasn’t one stress test, but it was a thorough understanding of the economics of the actual business that drove their decisionmaking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is disagreement or contention regarding the reasons for people getting out of the subprime business or reducing their scale. The speaker, Mr. Peters, believes that these individuals made active decisions based on their understanding of the deteriorating economics and rising risk. However, there may be others who have a different perception or explanation for the actions of these individuals.


Passage number 392.
 MR. ANGULO.  I would also agree that your general point about banks being more exacting in their stress testing is a good one because it’s something we and other supervisors, to be honest with you, continually look at, and many times the response that banks get internally from either owners or managers or through supervisors is that, well, if it’s too extreme, it’s not really plausible, and you can’t really act on it.  The other argument you sometimes hear is, well, it costs a lot of money to integrate that across the firm and do it the right way, and that’s a tough sell.  So I agree with your point that we need to do more and then push harder on stress testing.  The way that you suggest is kind of novel:  You do a back test and show it to them.  That’s an interesting concept.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the general point being made about banks being more exacting in their stress testing and acknowledges the challenges and arguments against implementing more rigorous testing. The speaker also expresses interest in the novel suggestion of using a back test to demonstrate the need for improved stress testing.


Passage number 393.
 MR. GREENLEE.  I might add one thing to that.  In interviews we did with some firms, one point that they made was that stress testing was informative and important, but a next step they’re trying to take is what it would take to cause that stress event to happen for different types of assets.  So they are trying to anticipate—not so much that they just assume a 10 percent drop but how they would get to a 10 percent drop.  What would be the events that would cause that to happen.  Then they think that through in a more systematic way.  I know some companies have learned what their highly rated things are that are viewed as stable-value assets elsewhere on their balance sheets and are thinking about how those could start to unwind or to deteriorate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply adding additional information and explaining what some firms are considering in relation to stress testing.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 394.
 MR. PETERS.  We need to be careful with the nomenclature.  Stress testing right now in the industry encompasses a lot of things, and people will tell you that they do stress testing, but they are really doing static shocks.  What we are talking about is not a historical analysis but a kind of forward-looking scenario that builds in your view of the world.  Those are the firms that, again, made more-active decisions to reduce their exposures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: Within the passage, there is a disagreement or contention regarding the definition and scope of stress testing in the industry. Mr. Peters argues that many people claim to do stress testing but are actually conducting static shocks, implying that their approach is not comprehensive. He suggests that true stress testing should involve a forward-looking scenario that incorporates a firm's view of the world.


Passage number 395.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the passage as it only states "President Hoenig."


Passage number 396.
 MR. HOENIG.  I think this was very interesting, and I have a suggestion and then a question.  The suggestion is that this morning we had the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  This afternoon we should have the Federal Market Oversight Committee meeting, and that is what we’re doing right now in looking at some of these institutions.  My question is, As you look at these and you compare the most effective and least effective, are you in the process and shouldn’t we be in the process—because we go back and look at these horizontal reviews—of looking at what lessons we’ve learned about more-effective institutions and less-effective institutions during the horizontal review so that we can be more proactive in terms of the outcomes that we’re now seeing.  If we do that in a systematic fashion over time, we could anticipate not all—we learned a long time ago that you cannot anticipate it all—but some of these differences and put more pressure on some institutions that were not doing good risk analysis to step up to it before it becomes a crisis.  I don’t know if we’re doing lessons learned for ourselves in that regard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement followed by a suggestion and a question. The speaker is simply asking if a certain process is being followed and if lessons are being learned from previous reviews.


Passage number 397.
 MR. PETERS.  I would say we’ve looked at a lot of that.  The one place I would highlight most articulately is the degree of international coordination and cooperation we’ve had under way.  The core firms in the United States are one portion of this system now, with a number of very significant global competitors.  So the coordination between us, the OCC, the SEC, the U.K. FSA, and the other senior supervisor groups has been really necessary for everyone to get a good understanding of practices.  It’s perhaps more valuable to some of the foreign supervisors who have only one or two large firms under their jurisdictions.  But even from our vantage point of what our direct supervisory responsibility is, the consolidation within the industry has collapsed the number of firms that we view directly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement evident in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the degree of international coordination and cooperation that has taken place in the banking industry.


Passage number 398.
 MR. GREENLEE.  I might add that we are trying to look at this.  It’s not just an issue of guidance, but we are going back through the supervisory process in terms of what we’ve learned through these interviews and challenging our beliefs and prior assessments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that they are actively reviewing their past assessments based on the new information and are open to challenging their beliefs.


Passage number 399.
 MR. HOENIG.  I think that is good because, if you think about it, we have the Basel capital standards coming forward, which involve the advanced method—relying on those institutions to a great degree in terms of judging their capital and their capital levels.  When they are under pressure, they will tend to work the model.  It is natural.  As we have said before, the incentives are that they will work the model.  So if we are not taking lessons learned from this in terms of anticipating those behaviors, I think we will repeat history in the surprises that we get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement.


Passage number 400.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement mentioned in the passage. The term "Vice Chairman" alone does not provide any indication of conflict or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 401.
 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Just very quickly, you did a terrific job.  I think it’s important, though, to recognize that this isn’t done yet, and we’re not going to know fundamentally how we feel about the relative strengths and weaknesses in the system until we see how this plays out.  Don’t let these initial presumptions—either the diagnosis or the prescription, particularly your list of prescriptions—harden too much because there are some judgments that we’re just not going to be able to make until the dust settles and we have a little time for reflection in that context.  I think a lot of damage has been done to the credibility of our financial system.  It’s not clear how much damage because we don’t know how this is going to play out.  But damage has been done, and we are going to bear a lot of the burden of figuring out how to craft a compelling policy response, recognizing of course that regulation may be part of the problem and won’t necessarily be part of the solution.  Anyway, mostly I just meant to compliment you.  You did a great job, and I think it’s helpful really to have this much work done early on in getting us to the point where we know what we’re going to do to the system to make it less vulnerable to this in the future.  Even as we manage the crisis, I think it’s good to have made that investment and a good tribute to the strength of the system that we were able to devote these quality resources even though we’ve all been busy managing the storm.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker acknowledges that damage has been done to the credibility of the financial system, but there is disagreement or uncertainty about the extent of the damage and whether regulation will be part of the solution. There is also an acknowledgement that judgments cannot be made until the situation settles.
