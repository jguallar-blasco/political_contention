Passage number 1.
 Hetzel, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond  Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on January 28–29, 2014 January 28 Session [Sustained applause] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We thought we’d just do this for a couple of hours.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 2.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you for that.  Thank you very much. Good afternoon.  Welcome to our annual organizational meeting.  First, let me welcome Presidents Pianalto, Plosser, Fisher, and Kocherlakota to the Committee. Item 1 is the election of Committee officers.  Following precedent, I’m going to turn the floor over to a senior Board member, who will handle the nominations and elections of the Chairman and Vice Chairman.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply introducing individuals and explaining the agenda for a meeting. There is no expressed disagreement or contention.


Passage number 3.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Because of the impending change in leadership and the position of Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, I’ll be calling for three sets of nominations and votes this afternoon rather than the usual two.  First, I’d like to ask for a nomination for FOMC Chairman to serve through January 31, 2014—which is to say, Friday—which happens to be Chairman Bernanke’s last day in office.  Any nominations.

[No response] I can take items 3 and 4 together.  Item 3 is “Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.” You received a memo on this.  Item 4 is “Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.” I think there were only technical amendments here, but let me ask Simon if he has anything to say about these two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if there are any objections or comments regarding certain items on the agenda, and when no response is given, they proceed with their statements.


Passage number 21.
 MR. POTTER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a prepared text. I’ll try to get through it pretty quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that Mr. Potter has a prepared text and plans to get through it quickly.


Passage number 22.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The word "Okay" alone does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply an expression often used to show agreement or affirmation.


Passage number 23.
 MR. POTTER.  At its first meeting each year, the Committee reviews the authorizations you just spoke about.  And, with regard to the domestic open market operations, I recommend that the Committee approve the authorization with one small wording change that would make the structure of paragraph 1A similar to the structure of paragraph 1B. In addition to this change, I’d like to update the Committee on two items related to the domestic authorization.  First, as you know, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it is conducting transactions in MBS.  As such, I recommend a continued suspension of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues. Second, the current authorization codifies the Open Market Trading Desk’s ability to transact in agency MBS for the SOMA through agents such as asset managers.  This year, we plan to remove this service from our agreements with the asset managers, which would allow for the removal of paragraph 3 from the domestic authorization next January.  No Committee vote is needed related to these two items. Turning to foreign currency operations:  The Desk conducts such operations under the terms of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations. I recommend that the Committee approve these documents with three   sets of amendments.  Please note that the vote to reaffirm these documents will include approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.  The first amendment is to remove paragraph 8 in the foreign authorization, which discusses the transmission of pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  I propose that this type of communication instead be governed by the Program for Security of FOMC Information, which currently governs the transmission of similar information.  The memo circulated ahead of the meeting titled “Proposed Amendments to FOMC Organizational Documents” detailed how the staff recommends that this be addressed in the Program for Security of FOMC Information. The second set of proposed amendments pertains to the central bank swap arrangements.  At the October 2013 meeting, the Committee approved standing facilities with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England (BOE), the Bank of Japan, the ECB, and the Swiss National Bank.  As a result, new language in the three documents is intended to incorporate these liquidity swaps and, where appropriate, align the treatment of the liquidity swaps and that of the reciprocal swaps that were put in place with the central banks of Mexico and Canada as part of the North American Framework Agreement (NAFA).  There are five specific changes I’d like to highlight related to the swap arrangements.  First, I propose aligning the review and approval process for any changes in the terms of existing NAFA swap arrangements with those for the liquidity swap arrangements.  Under this proposal, changes in the terms of existing swaps would be referred for review and approval to the Chairman instead of the Committee.  The Chairman would keep the Committee informed of any changes in the terms, and the terms shall be consistent with the principles discussed with, and guidance provided by, the Committee. To enact this change, I propose moving the language in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Authorization on “changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements” to the Procedural Instructions with the addition of paragraph 1D.  I also propose replacing the reference to “the proposed terms of any new arrangements” in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Authorization with broader language that states, “Any new swap arrangements shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.” Second, I propose eliminating references to the maximum term of any drawing under the NAFA swaps in the Foreign Authorization in light of the previous proposal to have the procedural instructions govern the terms of all swap drawings.  The swaps will remain “subject to annual review and approval by the Committee.” This affects paragraphs 1C and 2A of the foreign authorization. Third, I would like to align the annual review process of the liquidity swaps with that of the NAFA swaps by subjecting the liquidity swaps to “annual review and approval” instead of just “annual review.”  This also affects paragraph 2 of the Foreign Authorization.  While small, this change will require an annual vote on the liquidity swaps.  I plan to ask for this vote at the third or fourth FOMC meeting of the year along with the vote on the NAFA swaps.  This is consistent with the approach Steve Kamin and I proposed in the October 21, 2013, memo on this topic.   Fourth, I would like to expand the current arrangement for consulting with the Committee prior to initial liquidity swap drawings.  Specifically, I propose that the Chairman or the Foreign Currency Subcommittee will consult with the Committee when possible.  The resolution states that just the Foreign Currency Subcommittee will consult with the Committee when possible.  I address this change with the proposed addition of paragraph 2A in the Procedural Instructions. Lastly, I would like to clarify that any changes in the terms of existing liquidity swap arrangements shall be referred for review and approval to the Chairman, consistent with my earlier proposal for handling changes in the terms of the NAFA swaps.  The resolution approved by the Committee in October specified the approval process for changes to the rates and fees only.  I address this change with the proposed addition of paragraph 2B in the procedural instructions. The third set of proposed amendments clarifies the link between the Procedural Instructions and the Foreign Authorization through additions to the wording in the new paragraph 3A.iii and paragraph 4 in the Procedural Instructions. I would also like to update the Committee on one item related to the foreign portfolio.  Paragraph 6 of the Foreign Authorization requires that all foreign operations “be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.” The Desk performs a wide variety of tasks within its mandate to manage the foreign portfolio, and the reporting time varies by each specific operation, depending on the nature of each activity.  The memo we circulated ahead of the meeting titled “Request for Votes on Authorization for Desk Operations” included an appendix that clarifies the New York Fed’s Markets Group staff’s reporting practices related to operations conducted under the foreign authorization.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply providing recommendations and updates to the Committee. There is no conflict or disagreement presented.


Passage number 24.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  In designating these changes as technical, I certainly didn’t mean to preclude any questions or discussion.  Are there any questions for Simon.  Any comments.  [No response]  I have no objections, then.  [No response] All right.  We will take those as approved. Item 5 is “Proposed Revisions to the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” What we have before us was circulated before the meeting.  It is the statement that we have approved in the two prior years, with only two, nonsubstantive changes—changing “judges” to “reaffirms its judgment” and updating the central tendency for longer-run unemployment where that number comes up.  So this is essentially identical to the statement of  policy that we have approved the last two years. Because this is our third time through, I’ve conferred with Governor Yellen, and I think we agree that this year would be a good time to review this statement and to see if we’re satisfied with it, if it is saying what we want it to say, and if it’s consistent with our policy approach.  Governor Yellen tells me that she intends to ask a new subcommittee on communications, which—I assume, because Stan Fischer’s not here— will be headed by Stan if he is confirmed and willing, to look at this statement and consult with the Committee and see if there are any more substantive changes or questions that should be raised. Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and seeking input from the audience.


Passage number 25.
 MS. YELLEN.  That is, indeed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any statement or claim that can be contested or disagreed with. It simply states that "That is, indeed" without providing any argument or point of contention.


Passage number 26.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Today we have before us the statement as amended.  Does anyone want to comment on the statement. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply introducing a statement that has been amended and asking if anyone wants to comment on it. President Plosser might offer comments or insights on the statement, but it is not indicated whether there would be contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 27.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you very much.  I don’t have any objections to the first change, in terms of “reaffirms its judgment” versus “judges.” I’m not sure the nuances there will be picked up by the marketplace, but, nonetheless, I’m fine with that. Regarding the second change, though, there remains considerable uncertainty both in the marketplace and around this table about what we mean by true maximum employment and what it actually is.  And I think we struggle with understanding what it means and how it varies over time. I’m concerned that, unfortunately, over time, the markets and the public have come to think of what we report in the SEP as somehow our target as opposed to some information about our assessment, despite what we’ve said.  We had a discussion about this when we first launched this statement—and maybe this is a topic for the Committee coming up—but I’d be inclined to try to drop the last two sentences of that paragraph altogether so that we don’t find ourselves having to change the unemployment numbers every time the SEP changes.  We ought to thinkabout doing that—at least dropping the last sentence even if we don’t drop the second-to-last sentence.  So I’d like to put that on the table as something for discussion and for consideration by this Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows disagreement or contention. Mr. Plosser expresses concerns about the meaning of "true maximum employment" and suggests dropping certain sentences from the paragraph. This suggests that there is disagreement or at least differing perspectives on the issue among the members of the committee.


Passage number 28.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think it’s something that the subcommittee would have to look at. It’s certainly a very substantive change.  We do say, in the course of the statement, that this is our assessment of the long-run normal unemployment rate and that it can change.  This, of course, illustrates that it, in fact, can change. President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and acknowledging that the long-run normal unemployment rate can change.


Passage number 29.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I indicated last year—and I won’t go through my thinking again—I found the statement—and, in particular, the fifth paragraph—very useful in guiding my own thinking about policy.  But I’m very glad to hear that a subcommittee will be formed to evaluate the statement in its third year of use.  In particular, I think that—and I mentioned this last time at our meeting—as time evolves and we get closer to maximum employment and inflation gets closer to target, financial-stability concerns are likely to play more of a role in our deliberations.  And financial stability is mentioned explicitly in the second paragraph as being a factor that we take into account when we think about policy.  But it is not linked back to our description of the monetary policy strategy in the fifth paragraph.  So I think that is a potential opportunity for improvement that the subcommittee could take into account; that was the only comment I had.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is an individual expressing agreement with the statement in question and suggesting an area of improvement for future evaluation.


Passage number 30.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you. Other comments.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply expresses gratitude and mentions that there may be other comments. The mention of President Rosengren does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 31.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I’d like to follow up on that comment.  Thinking about financial stability in the fifth paragraph is something that is worth considering.  Also, maybe taking a fresh look at the inflation paragraph would be worth doing in two respects: first, maybe clarifying a little bit more the difference between a target and a ceiling and how the Committee feels about that; and, second, thinking about deviations below as well as deviations above and how we think about that.  So when it’s time for this Committee to rethink this whole strategy, in addition to the two other suggestions, those would be things to consider as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. The speaker is suggesting additional considerations and clarifications that could be made in the future, without expressing disagreement with any existing points.


Passage number 32.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We will put all of these suggestions before the new subcommittee when that deliberation begins.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 33.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will again abstain from the vote on the adoption of this statement.  On the one hand, I continue to believe that it doesn’t actually reflect a strong enough consensus among Committee members to permit a more effective communication of our policies to the public.  On the other hand, I don’t think it’s done any particular harm, and, particularly as interpreted and explained by the current Chairman—and, I’m quite confident, the future Chair—I’m very comfortable with those explanations. I do welcome the prospect of further discussion of the entire statement.  Some of you may recall that my original concerns a couple of years ago were focused on the absence of what I thought to be an explicit enough statement of our having a symmetrical loss function with respect to the two policy aims of the dual mandate set forth in the Federal Reserve Act, which is, after all, the source of this Committee’s powers. I continue to have those concerns, although, more recently, I join Eric in having some concerns about the way in which the inflation number is actually understood—whether it is understood as a target, properly stated, or as more of a ceiling.  I dare say that some members of the Committee would be distressed with a forecast that inflation would be 2.6 percent, 2.4 percent, and 2.3 percent, respectively, over the next several years.  But, as we sit here today, we have a forecast of inflation at 1.4 percent, 1.6 percent, and 1.7 percent, respectively, over the next three years—that is to say, deviating on the downside by exactly the amounts hypothesized as upside deviations a moment ago.I want to be clear:  I pose this hypothetical not to argue for a specific policy response, but just to draw attention to what I think is at least a latent issue with respect to the stated goal of 2 percent inflation in the current statement. So when it comes time for Committee deliberation on this, I would be very interested in hearing an elaboration of not only the points that have already been made by some of our colleagues but also, I hope, the points that will be made by others of you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states their belief that the statement does not reflect a strong enough consensus among Committee members but also acknowledges that it has not caused any harm. They express concerns about the understanding and interpretation of the inflation number and call for further discussion on the entire statement. This indicates a differing viewpoint or opinion within the Committee.


Passage number 34.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Anyone else.  Governor Tarullo has noted his abstention if we take a vote now.  Is there anyone else who would like to abstain or vote no. [No response]  Seeing none, may I take it, then, that we approve the statement.  [No response] Thank you. Item 6, “Proposed Revisions to the Rules of Procedure, and the Program for Security of FOMC Information.”  Again, without prejudice, I would say that both changes were mostly technical; a memo was circulated. I think the most substantive item here is to create a deputy manager for the SOMA.  Did you have anything to say on this, Simon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if there are any objections or abstentions before moving on to the next item.


Passage number 35.
 MR. POTTER.  No, I think the memo discussed the role of the deputy manager.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 36.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  The memo was circulated.  Are there any questions or concerns.  [No response]  If not, may I take this as approved.  [No response]  Okay.  Thank you.   Item 7, following on item 6, would be the selection of the manager and the deputy manager.  Simon Potter is again willing to serve as manager.  Given that the new deputy manager position has been approved, Lorie Logan is willing to serve in that role.  Let’s have some discussion.  I’ll give the floor to Vice Chairman Dudley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 37.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Lorie is a fine choice. She played a very important role in the Markets Group when I was head of the Markets Group back in the darkest days of 2007 and 2008.  She was Brian Sack’s chief of staff when Brian was the head of the Markets Group, and today she’s essentially Simon’s direct deputy on the SOMA and the Treasury operations in the Markets Group.  So she’s extraordinarily well qualified to be the deputy manager.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing support and agreement with Lorie's qualifications for the position of deputy manager.


Passage number 38.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any other questions or comments. [No response] Without objection.  Thank you. All right.  We’re going to get into the substance of our policy discussion.  Item 8, “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.” Let me turn to Simon Potter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 39.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I propose that we take up this resolution on the overnight RRP facility first. After we finish with that, we can come back and ask questions about the financial markets.  Just to clarify, the proposal is as follows:  First, extend this exercise for one year in order to allow more continuity with counterparties so that they can count on having a relationship that extends more than meeting to meeting.  Second, raise the allotment cap in steps.  The recommendation is to approve full allotment, but increases in the allotment would require the Chairman’s approval, and the staff has said that it will come back to the Committee to get further input before going to full allotment.  Finally, continue to manage the rate within 0 to 5 basis points to minimize interference with the federal funds markets and other money markets. Let me say that, in parallel to that—and again, I have conferred with Governor Yellen— staff work is under way that will look at the intermediate operating procedures that we might consider, the long-run operating procedures that we might consider, the effects of these types of facilities on the funds rate and the federal funds market, and the possibility of switching to a different interest rate indicator for our monetary policy communication. All of this work is under way, and, on the current schedule, the Committee would discuss these matters at the April FOMC meeting.  So that’s the proposal.  Let me open the floor for comments and discussion.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is presenting a proposal and seeking comments and discussion.


Passage number 40.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, when you talk about perhaps seeking or finding another market rate that we might use as our reference point, I presume that, again, despite the recommendation that was made, it would still be a decision of the Committee.  Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is seeking clarification and confirmation of a statement made by the Chairman.


Passage number 41.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without the passage, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 42.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you very much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a simple expression of gratitude and does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 43.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Others.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 44.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Simon, the higher allotment, which, if it were to persist, sort of amounts to temporary reserve drains—do you perceive that there’s any need to educate the market that this isn’t a small form of tightening in some way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and seeking clarification.


Passage number 45.
 MR. POTTER. We’ve been remarkably lucky in that sense—people seem to view this as an exercise.  It’s rearranging the liabilities on the balance sheet of the Fed.  No one has associated this with tightening yet.  That’s one of the concerns we had back in September, but so far, there’s been no notice of that.  I think the range of 0 to 5 basis points is really important, because that means that you’re not really affecting financial conditions in a broad sense.  What we are seeing is some effect in overnight markets, where we’ve seen low rates recently over year-end and where the usage goes up, but that’s really affecting functioning within those money markets and not affecting broader financial conditions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is presenting the speaker's observations and opinions without contradicting or opposing views.


Passage number 46.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, as the passage only mentions the position of "Vice Chairman" without providing any information or context that would suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 47.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I had a question.  If you raise the bid limit, presumably the actual take-up would probably be pretty modest, as the chart that shows that most people aren’t even close to their limit today.  Is that correct. Is that a reasonable inference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking a question and seeking clarification on whether their inference is correct. There is no indication of conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 48.
 MR. POTTER. I looked back at the transcript of the last meeting, and I said $30 billion to $40 billion.  And we’re averaging $66 billion—we did $94 billion today.  So I’m a little bit wary of what that would actually look like, depending on where market rates are.  What we’ve seen is a lot of people bidding between $1 billion and $3 billion.  We’ve seen more people bidding above $1 billion than you would have predicted from who was capped out.  That could just be due to the Treasury bill supply issue and year-end.  The highest usage we’ve had is $198 billion, and it would surprise me if we went above something like that.  And then you have to   think about how that feels relative to the $2.5 trillion of reserves out there.  But so far, no one has viewed this as a draining operation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their own observations and thoughts, without any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 49.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear disagreement or contention mentioned in the given passage.


Passage number 50.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement simply expresses gratitude and identifies the speaker.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 51.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support further exercises.  As Governor Stein and I have been predicting for a few meetings, short of full implementation, we’re always going to be left wanting to know some more about the effects of this.  I have some serious concerns about how we’re going about this, though.  I think we’re putting the cart before the horse to expand the time frame and to authorize full allotments at this time, even with the check-in that they talk about, before having the benefits of the staff’s analytical work, which I support and strongly encourage.  We should have the benefit of that work.  If we’d commissioned that in September, as I’d suggested, I think we’d be in a good position now, and I’d feel comfortable authorizing the steps the way they’re laid out in this resolution.  But I’m not, given the open questions we have.  President Plosser outlined a lot of them.  One thing I’d add is that the staff seems to view increasing the bargaining power of some financial market participants as an important benefit of that.  I find that really puzzling because it implies a diminution of someoneelse’s bargaining power, and you don’t usually think of monetary policy operations as targeting the allocation of bargaining power. There are two elements of irreversibility to the path we’re on that give me pause.  One was mentioned by the manager, and it’s that some market participants have been reluctant to join the program, not knowing how long we’re going to be committed to this.  That’s one of the reasons he advocates a one-year extension.  I think that, in some of the documentary material, he refers to that reluctance as due to switching costs—costs of severing counterparty relations.  Well, by the same token, should that switching occur, we’ll be in a situation in which backing away from the program would impose switching costs again, and that would raise a hurdle and would impede us from changing course if we weren’t ready to go full steam ahead in this direction. I think it’s too soon to go raising barriers to our changing course.  It’s too soon to commit on that basis. The other thing is the fed funds market.  Yes, 5 basis points is below generally where we’ve seen things, but this is a collateralized transaction, and you’d expect that to trade a little bit below an uncollateralized transaction like federal funds.  The risk here is that we suck all of the large dollar transactions out of the market—the Federal Home Loan Banks and the GSEs— and what we’re left with is the odd-lot stuff. Now, on a day-to-day basis, federal funds trades range up to 30 or 35 basis points.  So there are a bunch of trades up there in the 20s and low 30s, and they could dominate the effective rate.  The effective rate could conceivably go from low, from about the middle single digits, up to more than 20.  I don’t know—the Desk obviously has the data on it, and I don’t think we need to get into that.  But the principle here is that if we expand too rapidly, we could trigger the shift out of the federal funds market that the staff is, I think, rightly concerned about and that we need some analysis of.  We’ve got legal contracts,  OIS and the like, that are pegged to and that write in, as with LIBOR, this effective rate, and here we’re risking changing drastically the meaning of that rate.  We ought to be really cautious as we tiptoe up to that. So I’d prefer that we shorten the time frame to a horizon just after a meeting at which we’re confident staff analysis can come back to us, and that we not authorize full allotment at this time and we just authorize $5 billion.  I think that would be enough for another round of operations.  Clearly, we learned a lot at year-end, but, since year-end, there’s been a step-up in usage that we’re learning from, in terms of the effect of this program on the structure of money markets.  So that would be my suggestion for this resolution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses his concerns about how the committee is going about implementing their plans and suggests an alternative approach. He disagrees with expanding the time frame and authorizing full allotments at this time without the benefit of the staff's analytical work. He also disagrees with the staff's view on increasing the bargaining power of financial market participants and raises concerns about the potential consequences for the fed funds market.


Passage number 52.
 MR. POTTER.  Mr. Chairman, could I respond.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. Mr. Potter is simply asking for the opportunity to respond to something, which does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 53.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without the actual passage, it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 54.
 MR. POTTER.  I think it’s true that interest on excess reserves can achieve the goals that you want.  It will be somewhat messy, I believe, in the current structure.  There’s no doubt that we could raise rates.  The urgency here is, we’d like to learn how to raise rates in the smoothest possible way.  And if you are raising rates at the start of next year—a possible time frame under some measures—we don’t have that much time to learn about how to do that in the smoothest way, which is why we’d like the exercise to be extended in a way that we think we can learn the most. I think this is the discussion we had last time, President Lacker, on this issue. When we were thinking about it, we thought this was the best setup in which to learn the most in the next few months, particularly if there are operational changes that we need to make to make this more effective.  And the big change we’re not making is changing the rate structure; that’s 0 to 5 basis points for the moment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their belief and preference regarding interest on excess reserves and the smooth implementation of rate increases.


Passage number 55.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions President Fisher without providing any context or information that would suggest there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 56.
 MR. FISHER.  May I ask a question, Simon.  Is it critical that we go to full allotment in order to achieve what you just described.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 57.
 MR. POTTER.  It is not critical.  If you think of taking $10 billion or $20 billion as the cap and multiplying by 120 counterparties, that’s a lot of money.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is made by someone (Mr. Potter) and no opposing viewpoint or disagreement is presented.


Passage number 58.
 MR. FISHER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not state any disagreement or contention. It simply states "Right" as a response, without any indication of disagreement or argument.


Passage number 59.
 MR. POTTER.  I think one of the tensions here is between how much we want to be intrusive in the counterparty relationships that are there right now and how much we want to be intrusive at a later date if this is something that we use at a later date.  What we’re doing means if market rates go up a lot and they’re well above 5 basis points, you shouldn’t see that much take-up of the facility that we have, and it should be the case that you do get market rates moving up a little bit if the bargaining power does go up.  So that’s the bargaining power that people get.  Some people have less bargaining power, and that means that we’re not transmitting the rate structure fully through the way that we’d like to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 60.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, as you know—and I’ve expressed it in the media—I have enormous confidence in the way you—and your deputy, by the way—operate.  But I do think President Plosser and President Lacker have some good points, and I am a little uncomfortable going to full allotment.  I would like to have this Committee fully briefed; a lot of this is quite esoteric for all of us.  Again, this isn’t questioning our confidence or my confidence or any participant’s or member’s confidence in you, because we have enormous confidence in you.  But I do think, Mr. Chairman, that President Plosser and President Lacker raise a very good question.  I’m uncomfortable with full allotment for the same reasons that they expressed.  Again, I want to underscore—and Simon knows this, and you know this because you’ve seen it in the New York Times—that I have tremendous faith in you.  But I think we need to be educated in the process  along the way, and if it’s not critical that we go to full allotment in order to achieve a better understanding of this exercise, then, unless you were to say it is critical, I would argue the same as President Plosser and President Lacker.  I’d feel uncomfortable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses discomfort and disagreement with the idea of going to full allotment, agreeing with President Plosser and President Lacker who also have concerns. However, the speaker emphasizes that the disagreement is not a reflection of a lack of confidence in the person being addressed.


Passage number 61.
 MR. POTTER. We cannot say that it’s critical right now.  We can still learn more by increasing the cap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter states that it is not critical right now and suggests increasing the cap to learn more, indicating a potential course of action rather than a conflicting opinion.


Passage number 62.
 MR. FISHER.  And we want you to learn more.  That’s a key thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing a desire for the audience to learn more.


Passage number 63.
 MR. POTTER.  I’d say that I would find it harder to learn in a way that’s neutral if we didn’t have a long horizon over which to do that.  Setting up these speed bumps is a worrying thing to do, particularly if the speed bump is sometime in the summer and you see markets getting worried about the forward guidance.  They will be hypersensitive to some of the things we try to learn about at that time.  That’s why probably the 12-month extension is a bigger deal than going to full allotment right now.  I do think that something like $10 billion to $15 billion, looking at the chart I have here, allows us to learn more than $5 billion would, and that’s very close to full allotment. It doesn’t have what people have expressed—this feeling that we have to be going down this road.  I would say, personally, that the chance that you will choose this as one of the main tools that you use to control interest rates is close to 100 percent once all of the memos come back, but you might want to wait and find out.  That’s fine, because it’s your choice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and discussing the potential consequences and impact of different choices, but there is no direct disagreement or contention with anyone else mentioned.


Passage number 64.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to recommend that we not go to full allotment—again, just in terms of being fully comfortable with this exercise—although I do agree with Simon that this is going to be a critical tool for us to use.  Personally, I actually see it replacing the federal funds rate.  But I think we should be cautious, if only in order that we have a full understanding and because it is not critical that we go to full allotment to achieve a better operating understanding.  So that would be my recommendation—say, do the $10 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, initially expresses agreement with Simon's point about the critical importance of using the tool in question. However, he also recommends caution and a lack of full allotment, suggesting that it is not crucial to go to full allotment to achieve a better operating understanding. This is not a disagreement or contention, but rather a suggestion for a cautious approach.


Passage number 65.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Would you be comfortable with $10 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 66.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir, I would.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that Mr. Fisher agrees with something or is willing to do something. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 67.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the word "Vice Chairman" alone. It is a neutral title that does not imply any conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 68.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I agree with Simon that the time period is more important than $10 billion versus full allotment, but I also think that this suggestion that we shouldn’t learn more prior to April doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, because that’s actually going to inform the discussion in April.  Learning as much as we can by April is actually going to lead to a better discussion in April.  I also do have the same concerns as Simon that the more we can do now to put this in place reduces the risk of doing something later whereby this is seen as part of the exit strategy.  So I can live with the $10 billion cap, but I feel very strongly that having a 12-month time horizon is much better than a 6-month time horizon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. The speaker agrees with Simon on the importance of the time period and also agrees with their suggestion of learning more before April. They also share the same concerns about the potential risks of implementing certain strategies. The overall tone of the passage is one of agreement and support.


Passage number 69.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only states the title or position of President Kocherlakota, but it does not provide any information or context that would indicate the presence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 70.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, would prefer to have the $10 billion cap at this time.  I appreciate the remarks that the Vice Chairman just made.  On the other hand, I think we have to balance that against some of the costs that President Plosser pointed to—that going down the path of experimentation creates potential costs for us in terms of irreversibilities that might lead us to be more reluctant about certain choices regarding long-run operating frameworks.  So there’s an interaction between our experimentation now and our choices later that we should be taking into account as well. On balance, for me, the way to compromise between these tensions is a cap at $10 billion but an extension for a full year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges and appreciates the remarks made by others, but presents their own perspective and suggests a compromise.


Passage number 71.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  The proposal—$10 billion cap and one year—is on the table.  Is that acceptable.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a proposal and asks if it is acceptable to President Lacker.


Passage number 72.
 MR. LACKER. The concern about the time horizon that I hadn’t heard before has to do with the possibility that an announcement we’d make at the end of that period about extending the exercise further could become confused with a signal about the exit strategy.  Two things.  First, I think we can communicate the separation. We’ve done that with all of our experimental stuff so far—successfully, I believe.  I don’t think the Desk has reported problems in conveying the separation of these experimental things from policy signals.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker acknowledges a concern and suggests a solution, stating that the separation can be communicated successfully. He also mentions that there haven't been any reported problems in conveying this separation in the past.


Passage number 73.
 MR. POTTER.  Probably because we’ve been careful to try to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states a possible reason for some outcome without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 74.
 MR. LACKER.  Right, and I trust that we’d be careful again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing trust and agreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 75.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The passage indicates the presence of contention or disagreement through the use of the word "Yes" in response to an unknown statement or question.


Passage number 76.
 MR. LACKER.  But, second, it strikes me that there’s no less risk of confusion a year from now than there is six months from now at announcing something that might be confused with a signal about exit.  So I just don’t see the argument on that ground.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply presenting his own opinion and is not contradicting or challenging anyone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 77.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The term "Vice Chairman" is simply a position or title and does not involve any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 78.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, the second reason to have a longer time horizon is, of course, that people will take this as something that is going to be more long lasting.  So they’re actually going to adjust their counterparty relationships in a way that makes the test more realistic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a reason for having a longer time horizon.


Passage number 79.
 MR. POTTER. Which is the controversial part.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is because the passage consists of a simple statement or question by Mr. Potter without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments presented.


Passage number 80.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. That is the controversial part, but you want something that’s actually going to behave in testing how it’s actually going to behave in substance if you   move to substance subsequently.  So I think the 12-month time horizon is also appropriate because it’s going to make the value of the information we get better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their belief that a 12-month time horizon is appropriate for testing in order to obtain better information.


Passage number 81.
 MR. POTTER. We can also use rates if we want to ease the switchback. We can operate at zero rates.  You could decide to offer negative rates only.  There are lots of things you could do if you wanted to use prices to smooth people back out of it.  There’s maybe a six-month horizon on the typical relationship.  So going a bit past six months is helpful for people.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing potential options and strategies without presenting any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 82.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 83.
 MR. LACKER. Can I ask when the staff work is expected to be ready for us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question.


Passage number 84.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The April meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 85.
 MR. POTTER. We had a test of the federal funds market over year-end in which there was a reduction in the FHLBs’ supplying fed funds.  You saw a very small decline in the federal funds rate.  One story we’ve heard is that the overnight RRP actually helped with that because it was propping up rates.  So market participants definitely believe that it is providing a somewhat firm floor at the moment—just at this level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 86.
 MR. LACKER.  That’s great, but we’re talking about the advantage of a long period being building up momentum in participation, and that’s exactly what makes it a little bit irreversible. It strikes me that April is less likely, if anything, to be confused on the exit ground.  So the 12-month period from this April to next April seems more attractive than the coming 12 months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is giving their opinion and stating that the 12-month period from April to April seems more attractive than the coming 12 months. There is no opposing view or disagreement present.


Passage number 87.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, if you want to do this in a parliamentary way, you could make an alternative amendment.  We could compare your amendment with the $10 billion amendment and then vote that against the original proposition.  Does that seem fair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting a parliamentary approach to making an amendment and proposing a fair process for comparing and voting on amendments.


Passage number 88.
 MR. LACKER. Sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 89.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. What’s your alternative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "What's your alternative" does not express any type of contention or disagreement. It simply asks for an alternative solution or option, without indicating a disagreement with any previous statements or ideas.


Passage number 90.
 MR. LACKER.  April, $5 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "April, $5 billion" appears to be a statement of a specific amount and date, without any conflicting information or opposing views.


Passage number 91.
 MR. POTTER.  Through April 30.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence simply states the date "April 30" without expressing any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 92.
 MR. LACKER.  At the April meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage only mentions Mr. Lacker attending a meeting in April.


Passage number 93.
   MR. POTTER. And when’s the FOMC.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough context or information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 94.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s April 30.  Can we make it the end of the month. Is that what you want.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for confirmation or agreement about the date.


Passage number 95.
 MR. LACKER.  Sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker's response indicates agreement or confirmation.


Passage number 96.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  So we have the proposal of $5 billion through April 30, and we have the $10 billion.  I’m going to ask for a show of hands from all participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating the different proposals and asking for a show of hands from all participants.


Passage number 97.
 MR. PLOSSER. That’s $10 billion with a January date.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it simply states a fact about the amount of money and a specific date.


Passage number 98.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I meant $10 billion with a one-year extension.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the passage. The statement simply indicates a monetary amount and a duration of one year.


Passage number 99.
  MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple response to a statement.


Passage number 100.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We’ll take the winner of that and then ask whether we want to amend the original proposal.  All right.  So there are now two potential amendments on the floor.  Who’s in favor of $5 billion and April.  [Show of hands] That’s 1, 2, 3, 4. Who’s in favor of $10 billion and one year.  [Show of hands]  I count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.  Okay.  So the proposed amendment is $10 billion and one year.  We are now asking who is in favor of making that amendment as opposed to the original proposal.  Those in favor of making that amendment—that is, to change the original proposal to put on a $10 billion cap—please raise your hand.  Those in favor.  [Show of hands]  So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  Those in favor of the original proposal, which was no cap. I see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  Okay.  So the amendments are rejected.  Barney Frank would be proud of me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply taking a vote and tallying the results to determine the group's preference for two potential amendments.


Passage number 101.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  You need a few more jokes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The quote is simply expressing the desire for more jokes.


Passage number 102.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, I need a few more jokes.  Finally, we’re going to take a vote on the proposal versus negating the proposal.  All right.  All in favor of the proposal, raise your hand.  [Show of hands]  Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Those against the proposal.  So, 1, 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply describing a voting process.


Passage number 103.
 MS. YELLEN.  Is this just voters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the speaker's name (Ms. Yellen) and poses a question about voters.


Passage number 104.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Participants.  Should we do it again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The participants are suggesting doing something again, but there is no opposition or conflicting opinions mentioned.


Passage number 105.
 MS. YELLEN.  Yes, I think we should.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: This passage does not show any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 106.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s go again.  It should be just voters.  All right.  For the record, let’s have voters on approving this original proposal.  Voters in favor of the original proposal.  [Show of hands]  I count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  Those voters against the proposal.  Okay, 1, 2.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for a vote and recording the results.


Passage number 107.
 MR. FISHER.  The usual suspects, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the usual suspects, without expressing any disagreement or contradicting any other point of view.


Passage number 108.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Fine.  Well, nevertheless, I think the Desk heard some of the concerns. We will go slowly.  We will come back to the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage doesn't show any signs of contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a willingness to address concerns and take things slowly.


Passage number 109.
 MR. POTTER. At the start of the morning tomorrow, I would like to go through the Desk statement that we would release because the discussion suggested we might want to make some changes in that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is simply expressing his desire to review and potentially make changes to the Desk statement before it is released.


Passage number 110.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  And we’ll be very careful not to disturb existing markets unduly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the speaker will be careful not to disrupt existing markets too much. There is no mention of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 111.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: The passage does not mention any contentions or disagreements. It simply states that Mr. Potter is present or responds affirmatively to something.


Passage number 112.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you for that.  Now let’s go back.  Are there any questions for Simon on financial market issues. President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple request for questions related to financial market issues.


Passage number 113.
 MR. FISHER.  Simon, I want to come back to the very beginning of your presentation.  You mentioned, within the first three exhibits, that the decision we took at the last meeting was very undimensional and had little or no impact on Desk operations. You also mentioned, and we have the table in front of us, that the 10-year yield has actually come down.  The last time I looked, it was 2.77 percent, but the point is, it’s come down to close to the 3 percent area.  But you did mention, and we saw, a significant—I think that was the word you used—recent selloff in risk assets. I think that we have to keep this in perspective because we had about a 30 percent rise last year. The S&P is now two and a half times its March 9, 2009 low , and we see that, since the previous FOMC meeting, the S&P index is up 0.5 percent, even though it was up a little bit higher. You can see that in the right-hand chart. I drill on this only because I think we have to be mindful of the fact that we’ve had an enormously robust, bullish market.  There are going to be corrections, and they might be much more severe than what we had. Of greatest interest to me is that the 10-year Treasury bond yield has really not moved that much.  In fact, it’s come off a little bit. But I’m personally more interested in what happens in the bond markets.  And you would expect a reaction, of course, in the equity markets.  I would just like the Committee to be aware of the fact that it would not be at all surprising to see a not insignificant correction in equities—on the order of 10-plus percent— just because of the single direction it’s been going in for an awfully long time.  And I wouldn’t want that to condition policymaking, unless we see something very odd in the fixed-income markets.  I mention that, Mr. Chairman, because I think it’s an important point.  And if we were   to take chart 2 and stretch it out to March 2009, we would see a different picture entirely.  I think it’s an important thing for us to bear in mind.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and expressing their personal opinion about the state of the market.


Passage number 114.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions for Simon.  [No response] I need a motion to approve the domestic open market operations since December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply indicates that there is a need for a motion to approve the domestic open market operations since December.


Passage number 115.
 MS. YELLEN.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 116.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  Without objection. Let’s turn now to item 9, “Economic Situation,” and I’ll call on David Wilcox for the presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of polite and cooperative statements indicating agreement and cooperation among the participants.


Passage number 117.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Are there questions for David or Steve.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a expression of gratitude followed by a request for questions. The mention of David, Steve, and President Kocherlakota does not indicate any disagreement.


Passage number 118.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I want to compliment David on the inclusion of the alternative view in the box in the Tealbook A.  I thought that was a very positive step forward.  It’s very important for the Committee to be kept abreast of the debates that are being held within the Board staff, and so I found that very helpful. I follow with a question.  Over the last six months or so, there’s been, I think, a relatively large gap developing between what we see in the establishment survey and what we see in the household survey with respect to employment.  I was wondering what the staff’s thoughts about that gap are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses a positive step taken by David and asks for the staff's thoughts on a gap between two surveys.


Passage number 119.
 MR. WASCHER. You’re right, and I think the answer is, we don’t really understand why there’s such a difference.  Because they’re different surveys, there could just be measurement differences in the two surveys. The BLS tries to adjust the household survey to the payroll concept.  But in this particular case, that doesn’t really help very much. I think the other possibility is that there tend to be cyclical patterns in the difference between household and payroll employment.  When the economy is very weak, household employment tends to fall less than payroll employment, and the reverse occurs in recoveries.  One possible explanation for that is, in a weak economy, you may have a lot of people working off the books for a few hours a week.  They report themselves as employed in the household survey, but they’re not really on anybody’s payroll in a technical sense.  So they’re not picked up by the payroll survey.  It’s possible that what’s going on over the past year or so is that, as the economy continues to improve, you’re getting more people who are moving back into payroll jobs even though they were already in jobs in the “informal” sector, if you will.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents various possibilities and explanations without arguing against each other.


Passage number 120.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. To maybe sharpen my question, your sense is that what’s going on in the establishment survey is more a sign of the evolution of labor market health than what’s going on in the household survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question asked to gain clarification or further understanding of the speaker's perspective.


Passage number 121.
 MR. WASCHER.  Right.  Over periods like that, six months or so, we tend to pay a lot more attention to the trends in the payroll survey than to those in the household survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their preference for paying more attention to the trends in the payroll survey over the household survey over a specific time period.


Passage number 122.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you." This is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 123.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. "Vice Chairman" is a title or position, and it does not indicate any disagreement or conflict.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 124.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I had a really—almost silly—technical question.  David, the question is about the 1.9 percent assumption on expected inflation in the last chart, in the bottom right of your handout—and it was discussed in one of the memos.  Because the  methodology changed, and therefore it lowered the longer-run average by one-tenth of 1 percent, you lowered expected inflation to 1.9 percent.  I think that’s a weird way of doing it.  Given that consumers think our target is 2 percent, wouldn’t you think they would still think our target was 2 percent.  I didn’t understand the logic of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses their disagreement with the methodology used to lower expected inflation to 1.9 percent. They argue that consumers would still think the target is 2 percent, which suggests a difference in opinion or viewpoint.


Passage number 125.
 MR. WILCOX. It’s an annoying situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply describes a situation as annoying without expressing any opposing views or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 126.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I just didn’t understand it.  I wouldn’t have done it that way, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The statement "I wouldn't have done it that way, I guess" suggests a contrasting opinion or perspective. The use of "I just didn't understand it" also implies a lack of agreement or confusion about the subject being discussed.


Passage number 127.
 MR. WILCOX. Yes, I’m sympathetic to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage implies that Mr. Wilcox is understanding or supportive of something, which does not indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 128.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Okay. I wasn’t missing something, then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is a simple acknowledgement and confirmation, indicating that the speaker did not overlook or overlook anything. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage.


Passage number 129.
 MR. WILCOX.  No.  But here’s the conundrum. We thought we had a thermometer outside that said it was 32 degrees. We took a survey of people, and we asked them, “How cold does it feel.”  They said, “Well, it feels about 32 degrees outside.”  We changed the thermometer.  Now the thermometer reads 31.  The survey expectations still were unchanged, as before.  How do we handle that situation. That’s a crude analogy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting a situation and asking for advice on how to handle it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 130.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But we’re telling them, on the new thermometer, that we’re going to still be at 32, not 31, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is disagreement regarding the temperature reading. The speaker is saying "we're telling them" which implies that there is another party involved who may disagree or have a different view regarding the temperature measurement.


Passage number 131.
 MR. TARULLO.  No matter what it feels like, it’s 32.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Tarullo.


Passage number 132.
 MR. WILCOX.  I think that’s right, but I don’t want to debate it excessively because what we’re talking about is 10 basis points on the inflation rate.  Perhaps with this discussion we could feel that we’ve done our job of alerting—and you’ve helped to alert—the Committee to the issue.  To the extent of 10 basis points on the inflation rate, we think that, at the margin, you’ll need to run that much of a more expansionary monetary policy in order to get inflation, as  actually measured, up to your 2 percent objective.  And that’s the reason why we felt duty bound, constrained by intellectual integrity, to reduce expectations to 1.9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses their belief that a 10 basis point increase in the inflation rate would require a slightly more expansionary monetary policy to reach the 2 percent objective. There is no disagreement or argument presented by any other party.


Passage number 133.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess what I’m concerned about is, I would be hesitant in future meetings to have the chart continue to show 1.9 percent inflation expectations in perpetuity when we’re targeting 2 percent.  It just seems inconsistent. I’m going to drop that.  I have a question for Steve that’s more substantive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their concern about the inconsistency of the chart showing 1.9 percent inflation expectations when the target is 2 percent. They then decide to drop that concern and move on to a more substantive question for Steve.


Passage number 134.
 MR. KAMIN.  I hope so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a positive sentiment, hoping for something positive to happen.


Passage number 135.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Well, this is clearly relevant, though, to what you show going forward.  EMEs—you’ve seen the turbulence recently. We have a forecast of acceleration in economic growth.  How nervous are you about that forecast, given that we’ve seen some very sharp market moves in recent days. Not knowing what’s going to happen, do you put much weight on what’s been happening over the last week in terms of a risk to the forecast, or do you put very little weight on it. I just want to get your sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for the opinion or viewpoint of the person they are addressing.


Passage number 136.
 MR. KAMIN.  I would say that we put more than very little weight on it. The way I would put it is, as we moved into the second half of the year, when emerging markets were obviously in a more turbulent situation, responding to expectations of tightening in the United States and other advanced economies, we perceived the volatility and we assumed it would last for quite some time, moving into the coming year.  What’s been happening recently is a little bit outsized in comparison with our expectations, because we wouldn’t have expected so much volatility both to erupt so quickly and to have such a marked impact on advanced-economy equity markets and bond markets.  In that sense, it’s been a little faster and more marked than we would have expected.  But these things happen.  And, that said, the upswing in volatility is more or less consistent with our sense that there were going to be these bumps in the road, and that this is one of them.  In that sense, if we had to redo our Tealbook forecast right now, we might shave it down just a touch to acknowledge this, but we probably wouldn’t move it very much.  So that’s the baseline. All of that said, we know from experience that seemingly trivial events, like a Thai devaluation in 1997, can unexpectedly lead, through contagion in investor perceptions, to much more egregious events.  So there’s no way we’re going to claim right now that, no, that cannot happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply discusses their perspective on the volatility in emerging markets and acknowledges that unexpected events can have significant impacts.


Passage number 137.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Right.  Fair enough.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the previous statements and expresses gratitude for the conversation.


Passage number 138.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Governor Tarullo" does not provide enough context to determine if there is any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 139.
 MR. TARULLO. Mr. Chairman, can I just piggyback on Bill’s question.  Steve, have you incorporated in your baseline economic growth forecast any sense of the reaction that emerging market countries may have in order to stave off more financial problems.  That is, if they follow normal prescriptions, they’re going to do some tightening of monetary policy and maybe implement some austerity measures, which will presumably bring growth down.  And although that may have the salutary effect of holding off a set of currency problems, it would presumably be reducing economic growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

There is disagreement or contention in the passage because Mr. Tarullo is questioning whether the baseline economic growth forecast has taken into account the reaction of emerging market countries. He suggests that if these countries follow traditional measures such as tightening monetary policy and implementing austerity measures, it could reduce economic growth. This implies that there may be differing opinions on whether these measures are necessary and the potential impact they will have on growth.


Passage number 140.
 MR. KAMIN. Both in the December Tealbook and in previous Tealbooks dating back to the middle of last year, we had already built into our emerging market growth forecast the expectations that there would be some volatility and financial stresses, which would directly restrain economic growth, and, on top of that, prospective increases in interest rates, particularly in countries such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia, which would have to raise their rates in order to rein in inflation and to respond to the financial volatility.  So we had built in all of that.  The effect on EME growth is relatively small.  It’s on the order of ¼ percentage point.  And so far, we have not felt the need to, in some sense, increase the amount of drag we put into our forecast  in response to these developments.  Assuming that, in fact, markets calm down over the next week or two, we’d still be good with the adjustment we’ve put in.  If markets go a different way, then we’ll have to respond.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the forecast and the actions taken based on that forecast, without mentioning any differing opinions or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 141.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not display any contention or disagreement. Instead, it seems to be a polite response expressing gratitude.


Passage number 142.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 143.
 MR. FISHER. On Steve’s side, on the real economy side, one thing you might want to look at is what’s happening to the lease rates for Capesize and bulk shippers.  They’ve come up significantly.  China drives that market, as you know, and the build market.  They’ve replaced the Koreans to a significant extent, and the Japanese are now building for their own consumption.  So there’s a capacity expansion, and yet lease rates are coming up.  Purchase prices are coming up.  From what I understand from talking to shippers, a lot of this, of course, is driven by—even though it’s slower—a still-significant pace of import demand for iron ore, pulp, and whatnot by the Chinese.  As Simon pointed out in his excellent briefing, the Shanghai composite is not a very useful indicator.  And a lot of changes are taking place with respect to the shadow banking system and so on, as was pointed out.  So I think we have to be careful, but, as you say, we should be watchful. The point I wanted to make, though, is that, first, I want to agree with President Kocherlakota.  I think Mr. Wilcox has done some great work.  I like the devil’s advocate box, being a devil’s advocate; I also want to congratulate staff members on their very honest and straightforward paper on price inflation.  I have just one question that I didn’t see answered in that paper—and we can talk about it offline—but my question is, when we talk about measures of slack either in the EDO model or the FRB/US model, are you all focused on changes in slack or just the level of slack. It’s not clear to me what we focus on or what we input.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with others and offering congratulations to staff members.


Passage number 144.
  MR. WILCOX.  For the most part—and I’ll look to Jeremy Rudd, who was one of the authors—it’s the level of slack, but we do have some specifications that have a speed effect. We inspect those specifications from time to time.  Jeremy, do you want to add anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking Jeremy if he wants to add anything to the discussion, indicating a collaborative and non-contentious conversation.


Passage number 145.
 MR. RUDD.  I’d say that our main focus is going to be on the level of slack.  As David said, we do look at specifications that have a speed effect. We find that particular speed effects are present for some of the less-finished goods prices—commodity prices and that sort of thing.  But we find, in general, that our main emphasis is on the level of the gap, which is the level of the unemployment rate relative to a natural rate construct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Rudd is simply stating that the main focus will be on the level of slack and the unemployment rate relative to a natural rate construct.


Passage number 146.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  We’ve done some work on it—Evan Koenig, sitting behind me, has done some work on that difference—and maybe we could be of some help there. Finally, on housing, you mentioned single-family permits and starts.  Because the fly is in Garrison Keillor’s ointment, am I correct that, in terms of the four census areas, the West actually had pretty good numbers in December compared with the three frozen areas, as it were. So could you deduce that this might have been weather-related.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information and asking a clarifying question.


Passage number 147.
 MR. WILCOX. It could be.  Normally, the permits numbers are much less affected, and so when we’re looking to explain an anomaly for starts, we often take refuge in referring to permits.  Generally speaking, the anecdotes from builders and others are that they can get down to city hall and file a permit application pretty much regardless of what the weather conditions are.  So when it comes to looking at the permits numbers, those, historically, have been less affected by weather anomalies than the starts numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the general agreement that permit numbers are less affected by weather anomalies compared to starts numbers.


Passage number 148.
 MR. FISHER.  I agree with that, but I just did note it.  There was a differential, particularly in the starts.  And then you mentioned examining the pace of future homebuilding.  You have some questions about that.  For what it’s worth, again, I take a deep dive with thehomebuilders in my go-round before this meeting.  What I found interesting is that, first, their biggest concern is labor supply, which has a direct correlation to immigration policy and, second, their expectation, of course, is that the spring season started early.  But where they’re really finding cost pressures or frictions is in the ability to retain labor.  As you know, most homes are built by Mexicans—I’ve talked about how there’s a little Costa Rican contingent—whether it’s in Maine, Seattle, or Dallas, it doesn’t matter. But I’m hearing this across the board, for what it’s worth.  And it also has a price impact.  So that’s one thing you might want to examine.  It’s outside the realm of monetary policy, but, according to the builders themselves, it’s not insignificant.  That’s just a point I wanted to put on the table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of one person's observations and opinions. There is no clear contention or disagreement between different parties.


Passage number 149.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes, we’ve been a little surprised. To put exactly the same idea, I think, in slightly different vocabulary, we’ve been a little surprised about how steep the short-run supply curve is, and that it looks as though the industry may be undergoing some greater adjustment costs in getting back up to the kind of capacity that we saw before the recession.  Our guess is that those short-run supply restrictions will ease over time, and that we’ll get back to a situation in which builder capacity is much greater than it seems to be today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply describing their surprise and prediction about the industry undergoing adjustment costs and eventually improving in terms of builder capacity.


Passage number 150.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, and again, thank you for this good work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and appreciation without any indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 151.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you. President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Evans.


Passage number 152.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  Let me ask one and get an answer and then try the second one, if I may. I’m interested in the alternative simulation in the Tealbook related to low inflation, and I guess I’m maybe worried that our analysis doesn’t assign a very high cost to low inflation relative to our target.  So let me try to get that out.  In the simulation, the inflation rate is knocked down, and it stays there.  So the real rate would be high, and that would be bad for economic growth.  But because the funds rate was going to startmoving up, it has the ability not to move up quite so much, and it can basically offset that increase in the real rate because the zero lower bound is not really binding anymore.  That is, if you compare the real outcomes in this simulation with the baseline outcomes, they’re spot on.  There’s no loss of economic growth; there’s no additional unemployment; there’s really no real cost. So I guess I’m wondering whether there is a significant cost in these analyses to having a low inflation rate if the zero lower bound isn’t binding.  Just so that people aren’t concerned that this is only a low-inflation question, I think it’s symmetric. If we had a higher inflation rate and we could offset that higher run of inflation with a different funds rate, we might also have the same type of outcome.  I’d be interested in your reaction to that and what its implications might be for how we specify our loss function with regard to missing our inflation target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Evans, who is expressing his concerns and asking a question about the cost of low inflation.


Passage number 153.
 MR. WILCOX.  I would agree with you.  This is one version of a low-inflation scenario, and I think it would be possible to create versions that would be more pernicious in terms of their implications for economic activity.  We thought this one was among the range of possibilities, of which this is only one.  We thought this was one that was worth looking at.  The Japanese experience, for example, did feature a fairly lengthy period of very low inflation but not a cumulating downward spiral, and that’s what we had in mind here.  You’re right that, through the period in which the zero lower bound becomes less of a constraint, monetary policy is able to counteract much of the implication for real activity, but I entirely agree that, with other mechanisms, it’s possible to have a much more serious consequence for real activity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply agreeing with a point made by someone else and providing additional information to support their agreement.


Passage number 154.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes, I kicked this around with my staff a little bit, and so I understand the rules of the scenario, and it does seem reasonable.  You’re trying to have a run of low inflation.  I guess I was wondering the following:  If you told me that inflation in 2015 was going to be 0.8 percent after it had already been like that, would I then expect GDP growth in 2015 to be .4 percent. I don’t think I’d have that high a probability on that, and it is probably because I’d have a different scenario in mind—more like something that knocks down aggregate demand and does something.  But that’s a different scenario.  So I take your point of what you’re trying to get across here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of understanding and a question for clarification.


Passage number 155.
 MR. WILCOX.  I think a critical issue would be, what’s the precipitating shock that gives rise to the persistent low inflation, and is it conceivable to imagine a shock directly to inflation expectations, and hence to inflation, that doesn’t operate predominantly through weaker activity.  But there are other precipitating shocks that could do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents a statement made by Mr. Wilcox about a critical issue and suggests that there may be different types of precipitating shocks that could affect inflation. However, there is no indication of any conflict or disagreement among different individuals or perspectives.


Passage number 156.
 MR. EVANS. All right. Let me move on to the second question, and thanks to the staff for the inflation memo.  It was impressive analysis, as almost always—given the way that I refer to my own “somewhat expert” staff, I mean, how could you expect me to say something different [laughter].  Sorry.  All right.  Anyway, I’m going to tackle a bunch of tough issues, and I think that the inflation specification in your equation 1 makes a lot of sense for how you’re going about doing it. Okay.  But now, having said all of that, let me ask the unfair questions.  It’s also the case that global inflation is low, as Steve just mentioned.  And I guess there are at least two ways to think about that.  One hypothesis is what you lay out here.  There are a bunch of special factors—energy prices and things like that that show up as your colored boxes.  You’ve got anchored long-term inflation expectations, and it’s these anchored long-term inflation expectations that I really want to get your reaction to, because they’re playing an awfully large role in this. That’s the first hypothesis.  It’s a bunch of special factors.  They’re largely transitory—that’s why they’re special.  They’re going to work their way off, and it’s inevitable that we’re going to have inflation move up unless something else happens. The second hypothesis would be to back off the emphasis on the long-term inflation expectations.  And I appreciate how important they are for fitting the specification, but if you couldn’t have that, then the hypothesis might be that each country has a monetary policy that somehow just isn’t accommodative enough in order to get inflation up, because inflation ought to be monetary, and so everybody somehow is doing something similar.  It’s global low inflation.  So something that’s affecting inflation is happening in each and every country.  You think it ought to be a common explanation.  Those are two types of common explanations.  So we’re just not fighting hard enough in order to get inflation back up to its target. Now, after thinking that through, reading the memo, and looking at equation 1, I’m struck wondering what monetary policy does to keep inflation close to its long-run target. We’ve got anchored long-term inflation expectations, and we’ve got a relatively flat Phillips curve.  So we can debate the size of the resource slack for quite a long time, but it’s not going to contribute a ton right off the bat for quite some time.  And that’s exactly where you can see a role for monetary policy, on a meeting-to-meeting basis, to have some effect, but, instead, we’ve got long-term inflation expectations anchoring everything.  So that matters a lot, given the modeling choice.  The 1.9 percent question that Vice Chairman Dudley was asking about is another little annoyance in all of this once you link yourself to that anchored inflationary expectation.  I guess, when I think more deeply about it, the question is, what’s the role for monetary policy in this specification.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 157.
 MR. WILCOX. We think that monetary policy, as we said in the memo, plays a crucial role in supporting inflation expectations.  Predominantly, my overwhelming reaction to your remarks is, boy, that makes me feel really good, because it sounds as though the message of the memo came through very clearly.  We’re pinning a lot on this role of inflation expectations, andit’s an arguable proposition.  I think it’s fair to say that it survives only because, at this point, it beats any alternative that we’ve been able to come up with.  We’ve got a fundamental problem as social scientists here.  If we were attempting to build a model of inflation expectations, what would we normally do. We’d put the variable we want to explain on the left-hand side of an econometric equation.  We’d start out by probably putting a constant term on the right-hand side of that econometric equation.  And then we’d start looking for other explanatory variables.  Well, we’d quickly arrive at the conclusion that—oh, wait a minute—that constant term does a pretty good job of explaining the left-hand side variable.  You all, by running really good monetary policy over the past 15 or 20 years, have created a significant problem for us, from an econometric perspective. We don’t have any variation to explain in the left-hand side variable. Among other things, that immediately creates the difficulty that it’s very hard to posit a causal explanation for the role of monetary policy in influencing inflation expectations.  So I’m not going to offer any pushback, because, indeed, I think a main message of the memo was precisely that.  I believe I heard Governor Tarullo use the word “magic.”  Another possibility would be to say that it is, to a degree, unfortunately, an article of faith.  I wish I could represent it to you otherwise, but I think it’s important to acknowledge that. With regard to the global phenomenon of a downward drift in inflation, it certainly is very eye catching that, at the very same time that inflation drifted a little bit downward here in the United States, it was doing similarly in the euro area and in some other locations.  There I think Jeremy, again, and the others impressed on me the important point that our inflation errors over the past few years have, in fact, been two-sided.  Now, it is the case that, most recently, inflation has come in a little lower than our prediction.  In 2011 and 2012, the opposite was true.  It made me feel no more comfortable back then to come to the Committee and say, “Well, we’vehad a run of errors to the upside on actual inflation.” We put forward for the Committee an analysis that I think ultimately proved to be correct.  Past performance is no guarantee of future accuracy here, but our narrative now, for better or for worse, is very much the same as it was back then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining the difficulty of explaining the role of monetary policy in influencing inflation expectations, but there is no clear disagreement or contention between the speakers. They are discussing the challenges and limitations of their analysis.


Passage number 158.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you so much.  The memo and your response were extraordinarily useful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention in the passage. The phrase "The memo and your response were extraordinarily useful" shows appreciation and agreement, indicating that there is no disagreement present.


Passage number 159.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage "President Bullard" is just a statement of a person's title and does not provide any context or information that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 160.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me follow up on President Evans’s comment here a little bit.  I did like this chart in the “Forecast Summary” exhibit that shows the 1.9 percent inflation, although I do think it should be 2.0.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and appreciation for a chart.


Passage number 161.
 MR. WILCOX.  I think I know an adjustment we’re going to be making [laughter] for the March Tealbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that Mr. Wilcox has a suggestion or idea for an adjustment that they are going to make in the future, which elicits laughter from the audience.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 162.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  But I love your point, which is one I’ve tried to emphasize in the past—that a great inflation-targeting bank will keep inflation right at target all of the time, and then you won’t have anything to study other than the fact that inflation is at target all of the time. But maybe a way to put President Evans’s point is that if you look at a chart like this and you say that inflation expectations are anchored, then you get the impression that a situation like the one in Japan couldn’t develop in the United States because, well, inflation expectations are anchored, so it can’t happen.  But, as policymakers, I think what we want is some sense of, under what circumstances would we get stuck in a zero-nominal-interest-rate, low-inflation environment.  And I think we’ve struggled to be able to say something coherent about that and to be able to put a probability on that.  So I don’t want to put words in your mouth, President Evans, but I guess, in my interpretation of what he said, that what would be useful topolicymakers is some kind of statement about how likely that outcome is, what types of things might lead to that outcome in the United States, and, maybe beyond that, what could we do to avoid that. For that, you would need a model of why longer-term inflation expectations might drift, and we don’t really have that model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage contains some level of disagreement or difference of opinion. Mr. Bullard is emphasizing the importance of keeping inflation at target all the time, while President Evans seems to be suggesting that it is important to have a sense of when and how a low-inflation environment could occur and what actions could be taken to avoid it. There may be some contention or differing perspectives on the most effective approach to managing inflation.


Passage number 163.
 MR. WILCOX. It’s precisely with the Japanese example in mind that Jeremy and his coauthors put the figure on page 11, which demonstrates that, in the Japanese case, inflation expectations remained really quite stable, and, for a time, actual inflation, on a long moving-average, tracked those expectations quite well.  But then what’s worrisome and is intended precisely to put a pit in your collective stomachs is that actual inflation began to track lower and became detached from inflation expectations.  And so it’s with that in mind that we wanted to make sure to communicate the real doubt that we have about whether this will necessarily work out in the way that we’ve outlined in the baseline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining a situation and expressing concern, but there is no evidence of opposing viewpoints or disagreement.


Passage number 164.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 165.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Moving to a less existential level here on inflation, I have two sorts of questions.  First, I’d like to follow up on the comments of President Kocherlakota and others who have expressed appreciation for the alternative that was put forward in the Tealbook.  I think that’s a great contribution.  I look forward to other alternatives being laid out and discussed in a similar manner.  But I had one question about that, and this may be asking too much.  It would be interesting over time, as these scenarios are more fully described, for the staff to offer some guidance or thoughts about the broad probabilities they place on some of these scenarios.  Are they highly likely or very unlikely.  Clearly, they are not the modal forecast.  We understand that.  But the staff’s view of how the probabilities associated with these various scenarios may be shifting over time might be a very valuable source of discussion and insight as we move forward.  So I just put that out there.  I know it wouldn’t necessarily be trivial. The second question I had follows up on President Kocherlakota’s question about the household survey and the establishment survey.  One of the things we do know about the two is, a lot more revision goes on in the establishment survey, for all sorts of different reasons. Have you given any thought to the pattern of revised data that has occurred over, let’s say, the recovery. My sense is that, on average, we’ve seen a lot more upward revisions from the first print as we go through.  Is there evidence of any systematic patterns that arise in the revision process in the establishment data, particularly vis-à-vis the household survey. In other words, do they tend to move back, do they tend to move together, or how should I think about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 166.
 MR. WASCHER. The household survey isn’t revised, so it’s whatever it is.  It is the case, as I mentioned in response to President Kocherlakota’s question, that there do seem to be cyclical patterns in the difference between the two, and the household survey falls less than the payroll survey during weak periods and then increases less during recoveries.  So there are typical patterns.  They tend to move around and then move back toward each other over time. In terms of revisions, the big revisions are obviously the benchmark revisions.  We’re going to get the 2013 revision next month—we already know that it’s a downward revision if you adjust for some classification changes.  But the revisions in both 2011 and 2012 went the other way; the payroll survey was revised up.  And I think the general pattern is that, early in recoveries, you tend to see some upward revisions.  That’s probably due to increases in new business formation that aren’t picked up initially in the payroll survey.  Beyond that, there tend to be downward revisions during recessions and weak periods.  So, from 2007 to 2010, there  were downward revisions, and then in 2011 and 2012, there were upward revisions to the level of employment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any evident contention or disagreement. It is primarily providing information and discussing patterns in revisions to employment data.


Passage number 167.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I have one other observation.  I don’t want to make too big a deal of this, because I’ll get in over my head very quickly, but, in terms of the inflation issue, one of the things that many of the DSGE models have—and I think the New York model has this in it in some detail—is that the inflation process in those models depends a lot on the nature of the shocks.  In the financial sectors that they have, you can have these shocks to the return on capital or the marginal efficiency of capital.  And those things can actually work through the system in ways that can lead, at least in those models, to lower inflation than you might otherwise have anticipated.  It’s the nature of the financial sector and the restrictions in the financial sector that have given rise to some of that.  So I was wondering whether or not more work has been done in thinking about those types of models—as opposed to the classic, more traditional models that you report to us on—in terms of the effects that different types of shocks have on generating the lower inflation that we’ve seen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is merely expressing an observation and asking if further research has been done on the topic.


Passage number 168.
 MR. WILCOX.  I don’t know—is Egon Zakrajšek here. If he’s not, then I’ll attempt to characterize some recent research that he’s done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty about whether Egon Zakrajšek is present and stating their intention to summarize some of his recent research if he is not.


Passage number 169.
 MR. PLOSSER.  You’ll probably do better at characterizing that than I did in attempting to characterize my position here in the first place.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is acknowledging that the other person will be able to better understand and describe their own position than he was able to.


Passage number 170.
 MR. WILCOX.  I don’t know—Jeremy or Michael Kiley, are you familiar with this, before I launch into an attempt here.  Broadly speaking, what Egon and his coauthors are trying to explain is, why didn’t we have more disinflation. It’s a fascinating paper.  They are working with microeconomic data.  They split firms into two buckets:  One contains firms whose balance sheets were very adversely affected through the financial crisis, and the other bucket, the   complement.  What they find, I believe, is that the firms whose balance sheets were severely adversely affected through the financial crisis are much more resistant to allowing price reductions, whereas firms whose balance sheets were not particularly affected by the financial crisis behave in a more historically normal manner.  And it’s that mechanism that provides an alternative explanation, by the way, to the anchored inflation expectations that they put forward as a possibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a description of a paper and its findings.


Passage number 171.
 MR. PLOSSER.  That’s not exactly what I was asking.  But we can do this offline.  My question is whether some of these models with financial frictions of various kinds get movements in inflation rates that are not as closely tied to monetary policy as we normally think.  That was the gist of what I think some of these models are trying to tell us, but we can talk about this later.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser acknowledges that he was not asking the specific question, but suggests discussing it offline. He then clarifies his question, stating that some models suggest that movements in inflation rates may not be closely tied to monetary policy, and suggests discussing it later. There is no indication of disagreement or contention between the parties involved.


Passage number 172.
 MR. WILCOX.  Michael, do you want to offer any comments about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states that Mr. Wilcox is asking Michael if he wants to offer any comments. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 173.
 MR. KILEY.  It’s certainly the case that the staff did a lot of work on a variety of DSGE models with different types of financial frictions and shocks and on how the different shocks are transmitted through those mechanisms. You’re definitely right that those mechanisms and shocks can have effects on activity and inflation that differ from those of other demand shocks.  So it’s the case that financial frictions can alter the way in which shocks are transmitted both to the real economy and to inflation.  But I think it’s fair to say that there’s no common result across those models, because there are lots of financial frictions now.  And so I don’t think it would be fair to say that it’s a general feature that shocks, other than monetary shocks, become much more important in explaining inflation in some different way.  It’s a much more open area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that financial frictions can alter the transmission of shocks to the real economy and inflation, but states that there is no common result across different models. This suggests a lack of agreement on the importance of these shocks in explaining inflation.


Passage number 174.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Very model dependent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing that something is "very model dependent," indicating that it relies heavily on specific models.


Passage number 175.
 MR. KILEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. In this case, "Yes" is a response to a question and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 176.
MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 177.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don’t we take a quick coffee break and come back at 4:20 and start our go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 178.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. Let’s recommence, please. We’re ready for the economic go-round, and our first contributor is President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 179.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you. President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply expresses gratitude to President Rosengren.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 180.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The memos have done a very nice job of clarifying staff members’ positions on the important but difficult issue of which labor market and price anomalies reflect transitory movements and which reflect trends. The very low payroll number last month is assumed to be an anomaly, suggesting that much stronger payroll employment growth is imminent.  Similarly, part of the very low inflation numbers is an anomaly, suggesting that we will soon see PCE inflation moving toward our 2 percent target. In contrast, the large declines in labor force participation are assumed to be permanent, reflecting primarily demographic and cohort trends.  While the parsing of these data patterns into transitory or trend categories seems reasonable, I would note with the benefit of hindsight that we have not always been able to distinguish well between what is transitory and what is a trend. A simple example is the assumption that Internet investments during the dot-com phase reflected a change in trend productivity growth that could justify high stock prices rather than a transitory fluctuation, only to be revised down once the dot-com bubble burst. Thus, while assessments made by the staff are reasonable, our actions should reflect the inherent uncertainty around such judgments.  The payroll employment number was a surprise.  The 10-year Treasury rate moved down substantially after the announcement and has only fallen further with growing concerns around emerging markets.  Financial markets seem to have taken to heart at least some of the surprise information, at least for now.  The Tealbook makes clear that it is assumed that the low payroll employment is transitory, because it is incongruent with both the other labor market indicators and the stronger GDP growth we have seen recently.   However, the highly correlated movement of global stock prices surrounding emerging market concerns and the decline in the 10-year Treasury rate since our last meeting, despite strong GDP numbers and our strong GDP forecast, give me some pause about the forecast. The recent serially correlated misses on many of our PCE inflation forecasts are also assumed to be transitory.  However, the longer we miss significantly on our forecast, the less confidence we should have that inflation will be inexorably drawn higher by the gravitational force of our 2 percent target.  The staff highlights that in Japan the long-term expectations for inflation moved little despite inflation being below zero for over a decade.  The observation is very consistent with work my staff has done.  They show empirically that Japanese inflation data may have been more responsive to short-run inflation expectations than long-run expectations.  Similarly, the model that relies on well-anchored expectations fits the past 20 years of data reasonably well but is sensitive to the time period over which it is estimated.  If it turns out that, in very low inflation environments, short-run inflation expectations are more important than long-run expectations in describing the inflation process, we should be much less certain how quickly we will return to our 2 percent inflation target. The staff paper on labor force participation is good.  The paper provides a nice statistical summary of both demographic and within-cohort trends.  While I agree with the demographic exposition, the within-cohort trends seem tenuous. While there were sound economic reasons for the rise in labor force participation by women in the 1970s and 1980s, the economic rationale for a trend reduction in participation by prime-age male cohorts is less clear, and, thus, questions remain as to whether their lower participation rates will be reversed by a stronger labor market. In summary, we should be cautious about our inferences regarding which data reflect transitory influences and which reflect trends.  The implications of this uncertainty for policy,  which I will discuss tomorrow, suggest that a patient approach to removing accommodation is warranted. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker acknowledges the staff's assessment of certain data patterns as transitory or trend, but also raises doubts and concerns about the accuracy of such judgments. They point out past examples where assumptions about trends were proven wrong, and express caution in making inferences about data. This disagreement is evident in statements such as "However, the highly correlated movement of global stock prices surrounding emerging market concerns and the decline in the 10-year Treasury rate since our last meeting, despite strong GDP numbers and our strong GDP forecast, give me some pause about the forecast" and "The recent serially correlated misses on many of our PCE inflation forecasts are also assumed to be transitory. However, the longer we miss significantly on our forecast, the less confidence we should have that inflation will be inexorably drawn higher by the gravitational force of our 2 percent target."


Passage number 181.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

Passage number 182.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage simply expresses gratitude to President Lockhart, without any mention of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 183.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll start with some commentary reflecting input from our business contacts and directors over the intermeeting period.  Business sentiment improved, on balance, for the second consecutive intermeeting cycle.  Most of our directors expect economic growth will either be sustained at the current pace or accelerate over the next three to six months.  They are even more optimistic about the medium-term outlook.  The overwhelming majority of our 44 directors believe that the pace of growth will be higher in the next two to three years. Many think the downside risks to growth have diminished and uncertainty has dissipated.  This view and the associated optimism are pretty broad based.  We hear more reports of businesses becoming less risk averse, with greater willingness to place bets on capital projects and expenditures.  One small example is that companies that previously elected to rent heavy construction equipment are now beginning to buy the equipment instead.  At the same time, we did not hear reports of a notable pickup in hiring.  Hiring plans remained modest for the most part.  Hiring activity in energy and construction appears to be stronger than in other industries.  There continues to be a preference for overtime and automation before any consideration of hiring, and we continue to hear about difficulties finding certain types of skilled and experienced workers.  In regard to cost and price pressures, most contacts reported relatively stable input costs. We heard few reports of wage pressures.  Contacts in the construction industry were an exception.  In general, our business contacts report little or no pricing power.  The inflation expectations of most contacts were unchanged.  Overall, I’d say the opinions and anecdotal inputs of our contacts are reflective of the incoming data.  That said, I’ll note that public and business optimism has disappeared quickly before. Now to my outlook.  In the December SEP submission I had an economic growth forecast for 2014 and the remainder of the forecast horizon of around 3 percent.  Even with the increasingly positive reports I’m hearing from region contacts and the recent data that seem to confirm an impressive second-half growth rate, I’m leaving my forecast unchanged.  Basically I already had written in a shift to faster economic growth, and I think conditions remain ripe for stronger growth than we experienced, certainly, in the first four years of the recovery. My outlook for inflation also remains one of gradual convergence with the Committee’s target, although a little faster than in the Tealbook.  Regarding employment, like the Tealbook, I updated my projections for the unemployment rate, taking on board the drop from 7 percent to 6.7 percent. I now have the unemployment rate reaching the Committee’s stated full employment range of 5.2 to 5.8 percent in 2015, as does the Tealbook. That said, I have to express concern that the unemployment rate is separating from broader indicators of labor market health and may be losing its utility as it goes lower.  Influenced admittedly by anecdotal reports in the business community, I don’t see the declining unemployment rate as the leading edge of a burst of hiring.  When the unemployment rate was a lot higher, we could use it as a policy marker while ignoring the noise in the number.  In my opinion, it may be losing value as a communications vehicle as it falls.  I’m increasingly of theopinion that greater attention to wage and price developments may be more serviceable in the Committee’s communications.  The outlook I’m presenting is optimistic, but I think we need to see it soon in prices, wages, and income growth.  So far there has been no turn in the inflation numbers and little wage and income growth. I want to add my voice to those who thanked David Wilcox and his staff for the innovation of including an alternative view in the Tealbook A, write-up.  I found it quite useful because it brings into sharper relief the plausibility of different narratives with some support in the data.  In that vein, I worry about what the wage and price data may be suggesting about the actual strength of the economy and the sustainability of the recent improvement.  I’m concerned about an unemployment statistic that doesn’t match up with the broader employment picture— that is, participation, marginally attached workers, and underemployment.  So I’ll let that serve, Mr. Chairman, as my commentary on the balance of risks. Like others, I want to thank you for your superb leadership over these years, and it has been a privilege serving with you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 190.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The comments from my business contacts since our last meeting were more upbeat than they have been in quite a while.  Coupled with the better tone of the incoming data on the national economy, I am more confident that the economic recovery is on a self-sustaining trajectory.  And, consistent with the Tealbook, I think the economy is in better shape today than it appeared to be in December.  In addition, I have lowered my projected path of the unemployment rate, and I continue to expect that inflation will gradually approach our 2 percent objective. With that preface, I will focus my comments on two elements of the outlook that I believe bear most directly on our policy decision at this meeting—the labor market and inflation.  Starting with the labor market, my District contacts report a brighter picture for near-term hiring plans.  Compared with a year ago, the number of contacts reporting that they expect to expand employment during the next 12 months increased substantially.  While this information is anecdotal, it leads me to downplay the relatively tepid December employment report, and it increases my confidence that the unemployment rate should continue to fall going forward.  Of course, the unemployment rate did decline further since our last meeting. I recognize that December’s decline in the unemployment rate was associated with another dip in the labor force participation rate.  But the analysis of the participation rates by the Board staff supports my view that most of the recent decline in the labor force participation rate has been driven by longer-term trends, not the business cycle.  While some participants may have dropped out of the labor force in part because of the weak labor market, they also seem unlikely to quickly reenter the labor  market.  If this is the case, a moderate pace of job growth will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. Turning to inflation, over the course of the past year, inflation looks to have stabilized at a low level.  Translating the December CPI readings to their PCE equivalents, my staff estimates that year-over-year PCE inflation at the end of 2013 was 1.1 percent, both for headline and core, about where they have been since early last summer.  Meanwhile, the medium and trimmed mean CPI inflation rates have also stabilized, albeit at a higher level.  Looking ahead, it is most likely that inflation will gradually rise, in time, back toward our 2 percent objective.  But, as was discussed earlier, forecasting inflation is a challenging proposition, and the Board staff memo offers an interesting and helpful summary of the state of knowledge of inflation forecasting.  As the memo highlights, and as David Wilcox emphasized earlier, one of the key drivers of the Tealbook’s inflation outlook is long-run inflation expectations.  Research done by my staff supports that long-run inflation expectations can be helpful for forecasting inflation, and the model underlying my inflation forecast includes long-run inflation expectation as well.  Over time, inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent should help pull inflation up toward our long-run objective.  Longer-run inflation expectations, as measured by surveys, have been relatively stable in spite of recent low inflation readings.  Since last spring, inflation expectations from the Cleveland model have moved solidly into the 1½ to 2 percent range. In summary, when I think broadly about the outlook, uncertainty seems to have diminished some.  That is not to say that uncertainty is back to pre-recession levels.  Rather, uncertainty seems to be normalizing from elevated levels.  Nonetheless, I continue to judge the overall risks to economic growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly balanced.Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude my comments by also expressing my gratitude to you for the extraordinary leadership that you have provided this Committee and the Federal Reserve System.  I am one of only four FOMC participants at this table who were here before you became Chairman. Before you took office, you invited each president and each Governor to meet with you to talk about improvements that could be made to the FOMC deliberations.  At the meeting I had with you, you talked about making the meetings more interactive, you talked about improving transparency, and you said that you wanted to depersonalize the Fed.  In other words, you wanted to avoid becoming a “rock star.”  I want to compliment you on the many improvements that you have made to the policymaking process.  Unfortunately, the financial crisis and your creative and courageous leadership didn’t allow you to escape becoming a rock star.  In my view, you have handled your rock star status with great humility, and I have been very proud to have been a member of your band.  Again, I thank you for your extraordinary leadership.  It has been an enormous privilege to serve this great institution under your chairmanship.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 200.
 MS. GEORGE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The 10th District economy held steady overall since the last meeting, and bright spots in the region continue to be housing, construction, and energy.  Colorado is doing particularly well, and our contacts there report a fair amount of enthusiasm on two fronts:  brisk sales of a new legalized consumer product [laughter] and the upcoming appearance of the Mile High City’s team in the Super Bowl.  Aside from those transitory factors, consumer spending was mixed in late November and December, as automobile sales declined, while retail and restaurant sales slightly increased. Although most District contacts reported sales activity as lower than they had expected, retail sales actually increased compared with the prior month and were higher than at the same time last year.  Consumers have continued to pay down revolving debt balances while modestly increasing auto debt. The District’s unemployment rate, at 5.7 percent, is fairly close to its longer-run average and significantly below that of the nation.  Feedback from our business contacts shows net hiring plans moved upward for every industry for which data were collected, with the exception of bankers and mortgage lenders, which is likely because of the slowdown of the refinancing business last year.  When asked to identify the main reason for hiring more workers, respondents most often indicated that they expected more sales in the coming year.  Finding qualified workers to fill job openings continues to be a common complaint. My outlook for the national economy is unchanged from December.  I continue to expect above-trend economic growth of about 2½ percent in the first half of this year and then rising to 3 percent for the rest of the forecast horizon.  Certainly, a reduction in fiscal drag is playing an important role in my forecast for this year, as does, though, continued strength in consumer spending and expectations for business investment. I expect that consumer spending will be supported by an ongoing pickup in nonfarm payrolls moving closer to a 200,000 per month rate this year and next, which is similar to the January Blue Chip consensus, after growing at an average monthly rate of 182,000 last year.  Modest wage gains should also contribute to consumer spending.  The January Blue Chip consensus expects the rise in average hourly earnings to increase from 1.8 percent last year to 2.3 percent this year. These forecasts are consistent with the December Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, which finds that consumer optimism about future income gains continues to rise. I expect investment spending also should edge higher, as policy uncertainty fades and lending standards have eased.  Forward-looking indicators are positive.  For example, looking at Duke’s Global Business Outlook Survey, CFOs expect capital spending to grow 7.3 percent over the next 12 months, the highest rate since the first quarter of 2012.  Additionally, the fraction of small businesses planning on making capital expenditures in the next three to six months has picked up and is now at its highest level since June 2008. On inflation:  With measures of inflation expectations holding steady, the labor market continuing to gradually normalize, and import prices stabilizing, I expect inflation to firm next year and move higher over the next few years.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 202.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Fifth District economy has continued to show signs of improvement in recent weeks.  Manufacturing continued to expand, according to our January survey released this morning, which showed a third straight month of solid positive readings.  Our diffusion index for retail revenues swung from minus 15 in December to plus 18 in January.  In addition to these survey data, news on the housing market in our District was positive; new home sales and construction prices moved higher.  Furniture sales are showing some positive momentum again after sagging in December. Commercial real estate was more of a mixed bag, though, with improvement reported for warehouse, energy, and transportation projects, while retail and office construction remained fairly soft. Many of our business contacts are sounding guardedly optimistic.  Several bankers have said that credit metrics are improving and loan pipelines are growing.  In their annual canvassing of their loan customers, more of their customers reported a desire to expand this year.  One of our directors told us of a crane company that had its best year ever in 2013, and the largest builder in South Carolina is increasing its credit line. At the same time, firms have ample reason for caution.  A large department store chain based in North Carolina had very strong sales in October and November but poor sales in December and is now planning for only 1 percent sales growth this year.  Also, a large multilocation auto dealer said that 2013 was its best year ever, but that sales were down in December, especially the last week.  On balance, then, there has been a clear improvement in District economic activity, but we continue to hear notes of caution from our business contacts.  What optimism they do express is, as I said, distinctly guarded. In the national picture, the surge in economic growth in the second half of 2013 was striking.  A key question is whether that surge will be persistent or whether it will subside this year.  The recent data strengthen the case that the Tealbook has been making for some time now that GDP is going to be growing above 3 percent for several years, but I am still not completely convinced.  One of the most encouraging recent developments was the upswing in real consumer spending at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  We have seen similar swings before, though, and they turned out to be less persistent than we had hoped.  I would like to see an improvement in income growth to support the pickup in spending growth, but we haven’t seen that yet. Another reason for caution is that so much of the surge in growth in the second half of last year was attributable to inventory accumulation.  These additional inventories are only unwound over two years in the latest Tealbook.  It wouldn’t surprise me to see a much quicker reversal, particularly if consumer spending lost a bit of steam.  So I’m hesitant to sign onto a forecast of persistently strong GDP growth, even though much of the latest data have been encouraging. Turning to inflation, I’d like to also thank the staff for sharing the details of their framework for producing inflation forecasts, particularly their method for conveying the various components driving that forecast.  What was striking to me was both the importance of inflation expectations to the process and the stability of expectations in recent years.  Others have mentioned this as well.  Certainly, that stability is a good thing and no doubt is a reflection on our credibility that we have worked hard to earn. The staff notes that it’s essentially impossible to build an empirical model of expectations using data for the recent period in which they have been virtually constant.  I think it’s worth noting that we saw significant swings in expectations in the more distant past.  Extracting usable lessons from those data is obviously going to be difficult, but I think it’s worth trying.  The sense you get from the historical data, just looking at it roughly, is that dramatic and painful action would be required should expectations become dislodged. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I share the sentiment expressed by others around the table that you deserve our enduring gratitude for your dedicated service as Chairman during what turned out to be exceptionally trying times.  Thank you.

Passage number 205.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ve read the limited news that’s rolled in since the December meeting as positive, on net, but there have been some disquieting elements.  Most importantly, economic activity appears to be gradually strengthening.  That’s consistent with my expectation in the December SEP and with our Committee’s assessment when we decided to undertake our first measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  We’ve not yet  seen clear signs that inflation is moving back gradually toward our 2 percent objective, but it would be unrealistic to expect such signs to emerge in just a month or so of data. With respect to the labor market, there’s no denying that the payroll side of the December employment report was disappointing.  I’ve read a fair bit of discussion among the staff and outside analysts concerning the potential effects of bad weather, but I’ve not seen anyone make the case that this factor could explain the entire shortfall relative to expectations of more than 100,000.  In spite of the weak December payroll report and thanks, in part, to upward revisions to November’s gains, the three-month moving average stands around 170,000, a level that clearly is consistent with ongoing improvement in the labor market.  For now, my hope is that the December jobs reading will prove to be a temporary aberration and that payrolls, on average, will post stronger gains going forward. The household survey was more mixed, and I see the main question there as whether to interpret the large decline in the unemployment rate as signaling an equally large reduction in the degree of labor market slack.  This assessment is made more difficult by the accompanying 0.2 percentage point decline in labor force participation.  We’ve debated any number of times over the past year or so whether labor market slack is now becoming increasingly manifest in lower labor force participation rather than in measured unemployment, and there are arguments on both sides of this debate. It’s important for us to refine our thinking on this matter because, after declining about 30 basis points per year, from 2010 through 2012, the labor force participation rate declined a whopping 84 basis points last year. I found the staff memo on the behavior of the participation rate helpful in thinking through various potential explanations.  Concerning the role of demographics, the memo rightly highlights the fact that the shift in cohort sizes toward older cohorts with lower participation   rates dominates the modest increase in participation rates of older workers. But we are confronting a difficult identification problem, because these demographic changes coincide with the aftermath of a particularly deep recession. It’s conceivable that the demographic changes imply a steeper decline in the trend rate of labor force participation than the 0.3 percentage point per year assumed in the Tealbook baseline, but I remain reasonably optimistic that a substantial fraction of the decline in participation among younger cohorts would be reversed in a strong economy with a higher pressure job market.  In particular, I’m not at all convinced that many among the younger and prime-age cohorts who currently state they do not want a job would give the same answer if the job market were notably stronger, if, for example, quits and the pace of hiring were closer to normal levels and wages were showing more substantial gains. While I’m inclined to discount at least a portion of the large decline in the unemployment rate in December, it does seem fair to conclude that the drop signals at least some reduction in slack.  This view seems consistent with job market perceptions in recent surveys and the news we received on growth.  The level of real GDP in the fourth quarter is now projected to be 0.6 percent higher than we thought at the time of the December meeting.  Some of this upward surprise is due to stronger net exports, which are unlikely to continue making large contributions to economic growth going forward, but private domestic final purchases accounted for about one-half of the upward revision to GDP.  The strength we’ve seen in this component is certainly good news, and it suggests that the long-awaited acceleration in household and business spending may have finally arrived.  Although the risks to this outlook now seem reasonably balanced, the recent volatility in financial conditions faced by emerging markets bears careful watching.  But, to date, it appears unlikely to derail the generally more positive outlook for the global economy.   While I am hopeful that we’re finally breaking out of the 2 percent growth pattern, I think we should be careful not to get carried away with our progress.  Let’s keep in mind that we’ve experienced quite a few false dawns over the past few years, and even if faster growth is now for real, the absolute level of slack in the economy is probably still quite large by historical standards. The unemployment rate provides an incomplete measure.  In addition to the difficult-to-estimate cyclical shortfall in labor force participation, our assessment of slack needs to factor in the unusually large portion of the labor force that is underemployed.  The fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons still stands at 5 percent, a level not far below its post-recession peak of 6 percent.  Moreover, at 2½ percent, long-term unemployment still stands far above its pre-recession level of 1 percent. Furthermore, inflation has been disconcertingly low over the past year, and, at this stage, reversion of inflation toward our 2 percent objective remains only a forecast.  We noted in our statement that low inflation could pose risks to the economy.  I think a persistent downside miss could also pose risks to our credibility.  On balance, at this juncture, with the unemployment rate falling rapidly, I see our main challenge is finding ways to communicate that we intend to keep policy highly accommodative for quite some time and that we’ll be patient in removing accommodation when the time comes to do so. I, too, Mr. Chairman, want to express my gratitude for all of your contributions to the Federal Reserve and to the nation and say what an honor it has been to serve with you.  And I want to mention that the thought of filling your large shoes is a daunting challenge.

Passage number 211.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I pointed out yesterday, because of the significant uncertainties about how to interpret recent data, a strong case can be made for alternative A.  With inflation low, we have the ability to more quickly reduce the still-very-high unemployment rate by providing significant monetary accommodation.  Despite the recent reduction in the unemployment rate, it still takes too long to reach full employment, given that inflation is forecast to be below our target throughout the forecast period.  But given the decision at our previous meeting to place us on a path of measured reductions in the purchase program, though I personally would have preferred to wait, I can support alternative B at this meeting. However, I would note that the fact that we are not pausing despite a weak labor market report, recent correlated stock market declines globally, and persistently low inflation rates implies a very high hurdle for pausing on the path of very gradual reductions in the purchase program.  Butif there is a very high hurdle for stopping or slowing the taper, there should then be a very high hurdle for tapering more quickly. Yesterday I highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the identification of cyclical versus trend movements in the data.  Perhaps the most tenuous interpretation involves inflation.  Were emerging market problems to more significantly slow the economy, I am worried that our faith in expectations anchoring could be severely tested.  We could face a deflationary or near-deflationary environment that would require even-more-aggressive policy responses.  In essence, my concern is about risk management.  In light of the difficulties in separating trend from cycle in the data and the potential for new shocks emanating from outside the United States, we should be quite sure that the economy is on much stronger footing and that the inflation rate is clearly returning toward target before altering our current path of very gradual changes in our purchase program.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 213.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the policy decisions in alternative B and the statement language as drafted.  I am comfortable with taking the second tapering step, and I am also comfortable with the conclusion that the public and markets will likely form that $10 billion per meeting is the baseline intention of the Committee. I would like to make a few comments regarding communications challenges ahead.  As long as the unemployment rate is above 6½ percent, I anticipate increasing public pressure for more information on what “well past 6½ percent” means.  And considering the proximity of the 6½ percent unemployment marker, we know the statement is going to have to change before long.  We can see that coming.  We should think now as a Committee about the language to use once we get to 6½ percent.  On those questions, I am reluctant to put down another unemployment rate marker, as in alternative A.  I would prefer to keep our explanation of the Committee’s reaction function post-6½ percent more qualitative than quantitative, if that can be done. As I said yesterday in the economy go-round, I think a falling unemployment rate may be less reflective than we would like of increasingly satisfactory conditions in the labor market when you view it holistically.  In my view, we just don’t fully understand the factors driving the decline in the unemployment rate.  As the staff memo points out, the data on the inflows to and outflows from the labor market within demographic groups do not speak very loudly on the separation of structural from cyclical factors.  As a result, I think there is more uncertainty than usual about the path of the unemployment rate, about how much of the decline reflects reduction in slack, and about what level of the rate per se is consistent with full employment. I recognize that resorting to a qualitative characterization of the conditions that would prompt liftoff carries risks.  Reliance on qualitative statements that are open to interpretation, both within and outside the Committee, risks some confusion and volatility in trading markets.  To deal with the risks associated with qualitative guidance, I think we should consider less relative reliance on the statement in communications over the coming meetings and more weight on other communications methods in our arsenal—namely, the SEP, press conferences, and the minutes.  I think there might be value in reopening the question of enhancements to the SEP.  I will also support the suggestion of President Bullard, I believe, and others to go to press conferences every meeting supported by refreshed SEPs.  I say that with considerable empathy for our new Chair [laughter], given the singular and concentrated burden of press conferences.  The Committee has time to deliberate about the design of a communication strategy around the  coming meetings.  I am raising the issue now to urge work on these concerns, I hope, well before we get to the “well past” period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses disagreement with the idea of putting down another unemployment rate marker and instead prefers a more qualitative approach to explaining the Committee's reaction function. He also expresses concern about the risks associated with qualitative guidance and suggests relying more on other communication methods such as the SEP, press conferences, and minutes.


Passage number 214.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well before “well past.” Okay.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that President Plosser spoke before and beyond a certain point in time.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 215.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B today, but I do think, as President Lockhart suggested, and as Governor Stein suggested yesterday, that one of the things that we need to be doing is looking beyond the decision today to the challenges, particularly communication challenges, we are going to face in coming meetings.  I think the challenge is going to be, at least, that there is a reasonable likelihood that our 6½ percent threshold will probably be met sooner than we originally anticipated.  There could be a challenge if we reach that threshold and are still in a position of trying to ease policy by continuing to purchase assets. We will not have completed the asset purchase program by then.  I think that is going to present us with some challenges for communication.  And, indeed, while there are risks that things could turn bad again, there are also risks that things could turn much better faster than we anticipate.  I think we have to worry about that as well. To put it a different way, suppose the alternative scenario offered in the Tealbook comes to pass.  Suppose the forecast turns out to be somewhat better than the Tealbook forecast.  What kind of policy and communications will we have to engage in at that time.  They could be quite complicated.  I think that we need to be thinking ahead about how our communications and policies will react in those circumstances.  In particular, I think that if we are still buying assets when we reach the 6½ percent threshold, we face two sorts of problems.  Some may say, “Well, there actually is no conflict because we haven’t said we would do anything at 6½ percent, so we will continue to buy assets and we will not raise rates.”  But I think the language in the statement is going to prove to be problematic.  We have placed a lot of emphasis in our statements on both the unemployment rate and the labor market in particular.  One of the risks we face is that—as President Williams said yesterday, and others of us have said—if in fact the unemployment rate turns out to be a better summary statistic for labor market conditions than we have been assuming, then we are going to find ourselves in a difficult position where we are putting too much weight on labor market conditions.  I actually think that the better argument for keeping rates low longer, so to speak, is low inflation, not necessarily the unemployment problem or the labor markets.  So one thing we need to begin thinking about is how to perhaps shift the emphasis in our language about the reasons that we may not want to raise rates. Now, having said that, I would also note that if you look at the various rules put together in the Tealbook, by the second quarter of this year, for all but the nominal income targeting rule, we are no longer constrained by the zero bound.  Rates are positive in almost all those rules except for one in the second quarter.  I would also add that most of those rules don’t rely on the unemployment rate.  They are looking at the staff’s measure of output gaps.  Clearly those are related in some sense, but they are not necessarily driven by the unemployment rate per se.  So I think we will find ourselves in a position in which the rules are telling us we’re not constrained by the zero bound.  How are we going to behave.  That is going to present some communications challenges for us, and even though inflation will be low, the zero bound won’t be binding any longer. Again, I think this will be a communications challenge, and it’s important for us to anticipate now how we will deal with that.  Our statement has become very complex, with many moving parts, and I think we need to seriously consider revising the statement going forward.  If the forecast continues to play out as in the Tealbook, or somewhere between that and the  alternative scenario, I think we may face a challenge, and I would be inclined to encourage speeding up the pace of tapering if that scenario comes to pass. To summarize, I want to encourage that we not just think about what we will do if things get worse—we need to think about what we’ll do if things get better than we anticipated and what kind of language we will use or what kind of actions we will take in those circumstances. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is expressing his concern about communication challenges and potential disagreements that may arise in future meetings. He suggests that there may be different views on when and how to adjust policy if the economy improves faster than expected. This indicates contention or potential disagreement among the members of the group.

 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 220.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  In December, we took our first step on the road toward ending our purchase program, and alternative B continues on this road at a steady pace consistent with the improving economy.  Alternative B also follows through on the state-contingent plan we laid out in December.  Markets weren’t disrupted by our plan, in part because we successfully communicated that tapering purchases didn’t mean we were in a hurry to raise the funds rate.  Market perceptions regarding asset purchases and the future funds rate path are currently well aligned with our own. On specifics of language, I find that in the second sentence of paragraph 1 it’s simply too negative to say that labor market indicators were mixed.  In fact, essentially all indicators continue to show improvement.  Payroll gains were a disappointment, of course, but the Tealbook discounts their signal while noting that the disappointing gains were nonetheless consistent with, and I quote, “some improvement in labor markets.” I recommend we replace the  second sentence with the following: “On balance, labor market conditions have shown further improvement.”  I think it is more accurate, and it avoids the risk of being misinterpreted. Like President Evans and many others, I agree with you that our forward guidance has been very successful, but clearly paragraph 5 is about to reach its expiration date in the reference to 6½ percent unemployment.  The quantitative forward guidance in that paragraph as amended and bolstered with strong qualitative post-threshold guidance has succeeded in bringing market expectations about liftoff into alignment with our own views, but much of this paragraph is written with explicit or implicit reference to the 6½ percent threshold. And I just want to mention that we could easily reach that threshold very soon.  Perhaps we actually already have, once we’ve seen the January data.  So I think we need to rewrite the forward guidance for the post-threshold world as soon as possible.  I agreed with President Lockhart’s comments, but he said “over the coming meetings,” and I don’t think that is realistic. I think it has got to be between now and March that we really think about this, given that unemployment could be down below 6½ percent very soon. Another issue I’d like to bring up is our forward guidance on asset purchases. The unemployment rate is linked to our guidance on asset purchases as well—once the unemployment rate is in the low 6s, it may be hard to understand what we mean by “substantial improvement in the labor market.”  So it would be helpful to see options around both of these paragraphs, with some analysis, well in advance of our next meeting. A critical decision in thinking about paragraph 5, of course, is whether we want to refine our quantitative guidance as in alternative A or rely on purely qualitative guidance regarding the future path of the funds rate.  And here, like President Lockhart, my view is that with market expectations well aligned with our own, the experience in December suggests that clear   qualitative guidance can effectively signal the ongoing need for a highly accommodative stance of policy.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker disagrees with the language used to describe the labor market indicators and suggests alternative phrasing. The speaker also disagrees with the timeline for rewriting the forward guidance and suggests that it needs to be done sooner. Finally, the speaker suggests the use of qualitative guidance instead of quantitative guidance for the future path of the funds rate.

Passage number 223.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B and the further reduction in asset purchases at this meeting as an appropriate next step in the direction of policy normalization.  And I see scope for increasing the pace of these reductions if the incoming data are stronger than expected.   Even with these steps I remain concerned about the general stance of policy and, as others have noted, how we will communicate going forward.  As the economy continues to expand, our balance sheet also continues to grow, and the market’s ability to price risk and allocate credit remains highly influenced by monetary policy, while the desired influence of policy on business investment, job and income growth, and inflation continues to puzzle. Our forward guidance is now pushing accommodation past the advice of multiple policy rules, as President Plosser and others have noted.  Four of the six rules described in the Tealbook prescribe a policy rate higher than the effective lower bound starting in the second quarter of this year.  And although low inflation remains a caution, all of these rates incorporate the 2 percent longer-term goal. I also note the increase in the Tealbook-consistent estimate of r*, which is now above the real funds rate by about 30 basis points.  In the previous Tealbook, r* was about 20 basis points below the real funds rate.  With a combined 50 basis point swing, it could be argued that policy is now more accommodative than at the time of the previous meeting.  Of course, I understand that considerable uncertainty surrounds such estimates, but those kinds of shifts seem relevant to me in terms of assessing the future stance of policy. Changes in the estimate of excess capacity also are relevant to current and future policy. While economic growth did surprise to the upside in the second half of this year, potential GDP at the end of 2013 was revised down by about 2 percent over the past year. With the output gap estimated to be 1.9 percent at the end of 2014, a similar revision to potential GDP would put the output gap close to zero at the end of this year.  I’m not necessarily expecting that the Tealbook estimate of potential will be revised lower, but my point is that, given the trajectory of labor force participation and the expiration of emergency unemployment compensation, I see such a  revision as a risk, and a concerning risk, given that rates are likely to still be at zero at the end of this year. In the meantime, our policy settings continue to facilitate incentives that pose potential risks to long-term financial stability.  Asset prices and froth in various pockets of the financial sector deserve our ongoing monitoring, particularly in high-yield bond issuance and leveraged lending.  I recognize that identifying these risks to financial stability and quantifying their impact today remain difficult for sure, but we should not underestimate their potential effects or their ability to surprise. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to join others in wishing you all the best and thanking you for your service.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses support for a certain policy and raises concerns about the general stance of policy and potential risks to financial stability. However, there is no disagreement or argument presented in the passage.


Passage number 224.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Pianalto.


Passage number 225.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  Recent economic data point to a stronger conclusion to 2013 than I had previously expected.  And given the incoming data, I am more confident that economic growth will indeed remain above trend over the next few years, as I have been expecting—or perhaps I should say, as I have been hoping— for some time. In my view, the cumulative progress in the labor market warrants a continued gradual reduction in asset purchases.  Nonetheless, with inflation below our objective and unemployment still elevated, policy should remain broadly accommodative for some time.  I anticipate that the first increase in the federal funds rate will not occur until well after I am retired. [Laughter]  In my view, the first increase will not occur until the projected rate of inflation is approaching 2 percent, and at that time the unemployment rate will be well below 6½ percent. As a result, I agree with others that it is important for us to continue to work on our communications and to adjust the forward-guidance language as soon as our March meeting. And I plan to be here at the March meeting and engage in that discussion.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: In this passage, Ms. Pianalto expresses her support for alternative B and discusses her views on the economy and monetary policy. She does not indicate any disagreement or engage in any contentious debate.


Passage number 226.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Lacker.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 227.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Knowing how much, over the eight years we have served together, you must have enjoyed my policy lectures—I mean, statements [laughter]—I gave thought, in honor of your final meeting, to reviewing and recapitulating the highlights of my recommendations and commentary about how to conduct monetary policy.  Instead, I have written a throwback statement consistent with the theme evinced by the many throwback baseball caps that were given to you last night.  My policy statement is in the style that was common under your predecessor, when, as our Chair-to-be noted last night, the Chairman spoke first on policy matters and the policy go-round was noted for its brevity.  So here goes:  “I support your policy proposal, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, sarcastically mentions that he has written a "throwback statement" in honor of the Chairman's final meeting, suggesting that he disagrees with the current policy approach.


Passage number 228.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That was refreshing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "That was refreshing" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a positive sentiment or feeling.


Passage number 229.
 [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Better late than never, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of laughter and an expression of agreement, so there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 230.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is simply a thank-you message from the speaker (President Kocherlakota).


Passage number 231.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 232.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I think it’s appropriate to acknowledge, as alternative B does, that recent labor market indicators have been mixed.  But I sensed at the previous meeting that many of us consider the appropriate hurdle for pausing the process of winding down our asset purchases to be fairly high, and certainly this one employment report doesn’t cross that bar.  Moreover, the information we have received concerning final demand suggests that the strengthening we were expecting is now in train. I certainly hope that the two employment reports over the coming intermeeting period will paint a picture that’s unambiguously supportive of ongoing improvement.  With the inflation news having been roughly neutral since the previous meeting, I think it’s appropriate to reduce the pace of purchases by another $10 billion today. For this meeting, I also think it’s appropriate to make minimal changes to the statement.  We strengthened our forward guidance in December, and, as you noted, Mr. Chairman, that guidance still seems quite relevant and appears to be working.  Market views currently seem well aligned with our own, and the dealer survey suggests that no changes in guidance are anticipated in this meeting.  But, as many of you have pointed out, we could, before our March meeting, or at itg—especially if we receive two strong employment reports—easily be in a situation in which the unemployment rate reaches or crosses the 6½ percent threshold.  In that event, we will absolutely need to make changes in our forward guidance.  I agree with all of you who have urged that we need to think very hard about how to change the guidance quickly and that we need to be well positioned for either scenario, whether the data end up being disappointing and weaker than we have anticipated or stronger than we have anticipated. So I definitely think we need to make decisions at our March meeting on how to modify the guidance.  This is obviously going to be challenging.  You see in alternative A today one possible approach, whereby, as we approach the 6½ percent threshold, we would list a broader set of labor market indicators we would be watching, in addition to the unemployment rate.  Obviously, there are other approaches to consider.  I have heard clearly in this discussion, and think it’s a very useful idea, that we could enhance our guidance with respect to inflation.  Thecurrent guidance does indicate that projected inflation will factor into our decision on how long to keep the funds rate in its present range, but we could certainly consider ways to enhance our emphasis on how inflation will matter to future policy decisions. Listening to the discussion, I’ve heard some very interesting ideas during this round.  I would urge all of you to think very hard about concrete ideas that you have.  I plan to reach out to all of you.  I hope you will be in touch with me to offer up ideas that you have about the forward guidance.  We will try to use this intermeeting period to move forward on this, and I agree that work on this is absolutely urgent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. MS. YELLEN is expressing her support for alternative B and discussing the need for modifications in the forward guidance.


Passage number 233.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply expresses gratitude towards Governor Tarullo. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 234.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  Yesterday I highlighted some of the downside risks to the economy that I saw, but I did that, in part, in an effort to try to balance the discussion, which I thought, at least until Jeff and Bill and Janet began speaking, had a little bit unduly emphasized the upside risks.  I do, however, agree that there are upside risks, and so I also subscribe to the Chairman’s statement that risks are broadly balanced right now. I also agree with those of you who have suggested that our action today will solidify market expectations and that there is a pretty high hurdle for departing from a $10 billion reduction per meeting.  I would just add another thought, which is that once we have solidified those market expectations, any deviation from the $10 billion per meeting reductions will, I think, be read by markets as a pretty strong signal one way or another.  So that’s probably a further reason to think from our own perspective that there is a pretty strong presumption going in that this is the path we’re on.  That’s in addition to the reason of relieving ourselves from having to have the discussion at every single FOMC meeting. And, finally, of course, I agree with everybody else that we need to focus on the forward guidance issue and need to be ready to roll it out, if not rolling it out, by the March meeting. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement with multiple points made by others and adds their own thoughts in support of the decisions and actions being discussed.


Passage number 235.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply expressing gratitude towards Governor Stein.


Passage number 236.
 MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also support alternative B, basically for all the reasons that people have articulated.  I think we’re on a good path.  I think policy is appropriately calibrated to the fundamentals. Market expectations are clearly in line. Given where we have been, the homogeneity now is just remarkable.  It seems like the market can’t disagree about anything other than maybe whether we’re going to finish with a $15 billion reduction or reduce by $10 billion in October and $5 billion in December.  I think that to the extent that we can sustain that homogeneity and clarity, it is going to serve us well, because we’ve got all this complicated stuff around the guidance to deal with.  So I think that’s very helpful. I just wanted to reiterate a point that a number of people have made about the bar for changing things being high.  And I want to emphasize that I think that’s a good thing, but it’s a symmetric thing.  It’s not hawkish, as if we were saying that we should keep on this path even if the news gets weak.  I want to emphatically agree with President Rosengren that if the news comes in stronger than expected, the bar for accelerating should also be very high.  A number of you have alluded to this. Mr. Chairman, as you said, right now the mechanical timing of the wind-down is an important pillar supporting our forward guidance.  We are about to possibly remove another one of the pillars as we cross 6.5 percent.  As Governor Tarullo said, there is potentially going to be a lot of signal content.  Suppose we got to the next meeting with good news and we accelerated to $20 billion.  All of a sudden, we would have moved forward this mechanical aspect of liftoff by three to six months.  I would be very, very reluctant to go down that path.  And I think there’s a sort of symmetry to financial-stability concerns.  If you worry a lot about financial stability, and that makes you careful going in, I think it has to make you careful going out, and you have to keep that balance in mind. On the guidance, I am in the camp that prefers doing things qualitatively.  I just want to put one thing on the table—and I really don’t have a clear view on the merits, but I just want to lay it out there for discussion—which is whether, as we think about this, we want to have in the guidance some explicit conditionality on financial conditions.  Again, it’s symmetric in principle. But the worry I have is that we get to a point where things detach a little bit and term premiums spike.  I suspect that, ex post, we would be willing to lean against that to some extent by slowing down the rate of increase of the federal funds rate.  Do we want to allude to that ex ante on the possible theory that letting the market know that we would be leaning against that might tamp down the volatility in the first place.  I don’t know.  It’s conceptually interesting.  I think it’s worth discussing.  I don’t have a clear view, but I hope it would be something that we could give a little bit of thought to.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and agreeing with points previously made by others. They also discuss the need for a high bar for changing policy and mention a possible consideration for adding conditionality on financial conditions to the guidance. However, there is no direct disagreement or debate evident in the passage.


Passage number 237.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have made comments like that in press conferences, for example, and it was also one of the rationales for the non-move in September.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 238.
 MR. STEIN.  I was thinking exactly that was the rationale for the non-move in September.  Do we want to just emphasize that a little bit more and hope that it has a bit of a preemptive feature.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is merely expressing a thought and suggesting that they should emphasize it more.


Passage number 239.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states "Okay. Governor Powell" without expressing any conflicting opinions or ideas.


Passage number 240.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The sentence is a simple expression of gratitude towards someone with the title of Vice Chairman.


Passage number 241.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, thank you all for your comments. We have remarkable unanimity on the statement at this time, but there are a few issues, I think, that we want to discuss.  First is this question of the labor market sentence.  President Williams suggested “on balance, labor market conditions have shown further improvement.” The status quo is “labor market indicators were mixed.”  Are there any preferences.  Do we want to take a straw vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is remarkable unanimity on a statement, but they want to discuss a few issues and gather preferences on a specific question.


Passage number 242.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Take a straw vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The phrase "Take a straw vote" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests conducting a non-binding, informal survey to gauge the opinions or preferences of a group.


Passage number 243.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 244.
 MR. BULLARD.  I like President Williams’s suggestion.  I do think that, over the past several months, the indicators were coming in pretty strong, even though we got the bad number in the December report. I’m not sure we want to say “mixed” at this juncture—it might feed into the market turmoil that’s going on right now.  It is a little bit of a concern.  So I think it would be fair to say “on balance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard agrees with President Williams's suggestion and expresses some concern about using the word "mixed" in relation to the indicators and market turmoil. However, there is no direct disagreement or argument present.


Passage number 245.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement or introduction about President Plosser.


Passage number 246.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I was going to say I agree with President Bullard and President Williams.  I think the formulation “on balance” doesn’t say anything to suggest that there weren’t differing signals.  But if it’s a description of what we thought on balance, I’d be inclined to support that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, acknowledges that he agrees with President Bullard and President Williams and further explains his agreement by stating that the phrase "on balance" does not imply the absence of differing signals. Instead, he suggests that he supports the description of their collective thoughts.


Passage number 247.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 248.
 MR. FISHER. Well, as Bullard is my witness, I had written out one editorial comment that I forgot to mention in my intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that the speaker had written out an editorial comment that was forgotten to be mentioned earlier.


Passage number 249.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "Oh, okay" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple acknowledgement or acceptance of something.


Passage number 250.
 MR. FISHER.  I don’t think it’s anything to die for, but I noticed that Governor Powell and others referred to it.  So I would prefer it, but I don’t think it’s worth dying for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While there is a difference in opinion between "Governor Powell and others" who referred to something and Mr. Fisher who doesn't think it's worth dying for, there is no direct contention or argument present in this passage.


Passage number 251.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I hope not. [Laughter] The staff suggested yet a third compromise:  “Labor market indicators were mixed, but on balance showed further improvement.”  Is that it.  Can we go with that. SEVERAL. Sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses hope that there is no contention and suggests a compromise by agreeing with the staff's suggestion.


Passage number 252.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right. President Rosengren. PRESIDENT ROSENGREN.  That’s okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The reply "That's okay" indicates agreement or acceptance of the previous statement.


Passage number 253.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  So “labor market indicators were mixed,” as stated here, “but on balance showed further improvement.  Okay. Now, the other issue is that apparently we’re having more stress today in the emerging markets, and we asked Steve if he has anything to report on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information and does not present any explicit disagreement or contention.


Passage number 254.
 MR. KAMIN.  Sure. I will backtrack just to yesterday evening.  In the evening, local time, in Turkey, the Central Bank of Turkey announced very sharp increases in interest rates, coupled with a commitment to basically be more straightforward in their monetary policy. That was something the markets had been looking forward to, I think.  In the event, the increases in rates are greater than the market anticipated, and the initial response was very positive in terms of the Turkish lira strengthening some 3 to 4 percent against the dollar.  That’s what we were looking at, at the very beginning of this morning.  Since then, the Turkish lira has retraced and is now more or less unchanged from where it was yesterday.  The Mexican peso and Brazilian real have fallen in the neighborhood of ½ percent to 1 percent against the dollar this morning.  Also, the European stock markets are down about 1 percent.  As evidence of flight-to-safety activity, the yen is up ¾ percent against the dollar, as often happens in these things.  And U.S. 10-year bonds are down about 3 basis points.  This is not by itself a particularly dramatic turn of events.  It’s just evidence of continuing reverberations in a context where we might have hoped for more definitive easing of pressures. Again, it’s very hard to predict these things.  It’s actually reasonably typical in emerging market crisis situations for a dramatic move by the authorities to be followed by some positive response, then some retracing.  That’s pretty common. Now, what’s also true is that subsequently it’s almost as common for the situation to get a lot better as it is for it to continue to get worse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing objective information and stating common patterns in emerging market crisis situations.


Passage number 255.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So we don’t know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 256.
 MR. KAMIN.  We don’t know, and so this is all by way of considering whether you want to put in a short reference in the statement acknowledging that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It is a statement by Mr. Kamin discussing the need for a short reference in a statement.


Passage number 257.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let me just say that a simple thing to do, if we were so inclined, would be just to go back to the old risks language, “having become more nearly balanced,” and not change that.  That would be a simple thing to do.  But do you have a language suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 258.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think we have a couple of possibilities.  One would be, “The Committee currently sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced, but developments in global financial markets bear watching” or “but developments in global financial markets could pose increased downside risks,” depending on how firmly you wanted to point to the risks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting two possible options regarding how to discuss the risks in global financial markets, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 259.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The term "Vice Chairman" is a neutral title that does not indicate any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 260.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would really be reluctant to react to what are pretty small movements.  [Chorus of agreement] I just think that then it becomes a matter of the timing of the meeting and the timing of the event.  It gets over-weighted.  You know, if it happened three weeks ago we wouldn’t even be putting the language into the statement.  I think it’s too small a move to react.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their reluctance to react to small movements and the chorus agrees with them. There is no conflicting point of view or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 261.
 MR. TARULLO.  Can I ask a question, Steve. What’s happened with the rupee and the real and some of the other midrange emerging market currencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 262.
 MR. KAMIN. In fact, at least as of 10:00 a.m., the Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah are actually up slightly against the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents a fact about the exchange rates of the Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah against the dollar.


Passage number 263.
 MR. TARULLO.  That argues strongly for Bill’s position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage includes a statement that supports "Bill's position," suggesting agreement rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 264.
 MR. KAMIN.  As is the Korean won.  So it is mixed.  As I say, it’s not a great picture, but it’s not a terrible picture either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate any contention or disagreement. It simply describes a situation without stating any opposing views or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 265.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 266.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, these are very thin markets.  I agree 100 percent with Vice Chairman Dudley.  I don’t think we should be reactive in this fashion.  These aren’t radical moves.  There is the potential of harking back to the Thai crisis, which Governor Tarullo mentioned earlier, but we don’t see evidence of that right now, and I wouldn’t want to appear reactive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is in agreement with Vice Chairman Dudley and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 267.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The only suggestion I would put out for consideration would be not to actively improve the risk balance—that is, to go back to last month’s existing language on the risk balance. SEVERAL.  That’s fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The phrase "That's fine" indicates agreement with the suggestion being made.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 268.
 MR. FISHER.  But what is the language that we would use, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The language being referred to is a point of contention or disagreement between Mr. Fisher and the Chairman.


Passage number 269.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If you look at alternative B, we would change the risk balance from “sees the risks as having become more nearly balanced” to “sees the risks as nearly balanced.”  The fact is, that is a change, and it’s actually going in the direction of slightly less risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply pointing out a change in the risk balance, which is going in the direction of slightly less risk.


Passage number 270.
 MR. FISHER.  You just drop those three words.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply making a statement or giving a directive.


Passage number 271.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m just putting on the table keeping that unchanged so that there’s not a sense of greater risk, but not a sense of less risk either. President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their intention to maintain the current situation without increasing or decreasing the perceived risk. President Kocherlakota is making a neutral statement.


Passage number 272.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Sorry.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t like doing that in response to the news received, but now that you’ve pointed out that that change was made, I think it’s better not to have made it.  It’s good to keep the language the same as much as possible.  So I’m in favor of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. Mr. Kocherlakota expresses his agreement with keeping the language the same.


Passage number 273.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the title or position of "Vice Chairman" without providing any information about disagreement or contention.


Passage number 274.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, there’s a question about what the meaning is here, frankly.  Saying “having become more nearly balanced” means you’re moving in the direction of the risks receding.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: In this passage, the speaker simply acknowledges that there is a question about the meaning of a statement. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 275.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It means relative to the recent past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "relative to the recent past" does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply suggests that something is being compared or considered in relation to a specified timeframe.


Passage number 276.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I know, but you can read it both ways.  I mean, it’s not obvious.  I can live with either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges that there are multiple interpretations or viewpoints, and they are open to both options.


Passage number 277.
 MR. FISHER.  I can live with that one, Mr. Chairman.  I think that’s wise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the statement and believes it is wise.


Passage number 278.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  May we just go back. President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply requesting to go back to a previous subject or point of discussion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 279.
 MR. BULLARD.  I’m not sure this is an improvement.  We said at the previous meeting, “having become more nearly balanced.”  Now we don’t want to say that we’ve made further improvement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard expresses doubt that the current situation is an improvement and disagrees with the idea of further improvement.


Passage number 280.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Right.  That’s my point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Right. That's my point" shows agreement and understanding between the speaker and the listener.


Passage number 281.
 MR. FISHER.  I don’t think it’s going to be noticed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply a personal belief or opinion of the speaker.


Passage number 282.
  MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It will not be noticed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting ideas or contradicting statements. It is a straightforward statement that something will go unnoticed.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  May I exert executive privilege here and just ask to put it back to where it was the last time.  I don’t think it’s going to be read any way other than as just a repetition of our assessments last time. Are there any other thoughts or considerations.

 MS. LOGAN.5 Given the directive on asset purchases and the resolution passed on the overnight RRP exercise, the Desk intends to release two statements simultaneously with the FOMC statement, and there should be two being circulated at the moment. The first statement indicates that the Desk will begin buying agency MBS and Treasury securities at the lower $30 billion and $35 billion monthly pace beginning in February.  Further, it notes that the Desk will complete the existing January schedules as previously released, and all other elements of the statement are identical to what we released with the December Desk statement on asset purchases. 5 The materials used by Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 6).

 MS. LOGAN.6  The second statement, which in your handout is titled “Statement to Revise Terms of Overnight Fixed-Rate Reverse Repurchase Agreement Operational Exercise,” notes that the Committee has authorized the Desk to continue the overnight RRP exercise through January 30, 2015, and to modify the terms.  It notes that the maximum allotment cap will be increased starting in tomorrow’s operation, to $5 billion, and that over the coming months it may be increased further.  Last, it notes that the fixed rate on the operations continues to be authorized between 0 and 5 basis points, and that the current fixed rate will be maintained at 3 basis points. This statement has been adjusted from the one circulated ahead of the meeting in the memo on the overnight RRP, in order to remove a clause in that original draft that noted, “The individual counterparty caps may be lifted altogether with the operations conducted in a full allotment.” We made that adjustment to reflect the discussion yesterday and to maintain more opportunity for consultation about whether and when to take that last step.  Thank you.
