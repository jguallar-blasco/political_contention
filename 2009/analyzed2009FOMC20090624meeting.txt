Passage number 1.
   Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on  June 23-24, 2009  June 23, 2009—Afternoon Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good afternoon, everybody.  This is a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board, as has been our custom in the past, so I need a motion to close the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement evident in this passage. The passage simply states that a motion is needed to close the meeting.


Passage number 2.
 MR. KOHN. So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "So moved" is a standard phrase used in formal settings, usually in response to a motion being presented. It indicates agreement or support for the motion and does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 3.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let me first welcome Brian Sack officially in his role as manager of the System Open Market Account.  We look forward to a long and productive association. I also want to mention that I know there’s a great deal of interest in the Administration’s financial regulatory reform plan and its implications for the Federal Reserve.  Tomorrow at lunch after the meeting, I will update you on what I know about it, and then we can have some discussion if you’d like. We have a substantial number of presentations today.  The staff has made an extraordinary effort to provide us with a great deal of background information on the balance sheet, reserve management, exit strategy, and important related issues.  If the Committee is willing, I’d like to go straight through the first set of presentations with clarifying questions only and then have as much Q&A as the Committee would like and then a general discussion.  If that’s all right, then let’s begin with Brian Sack to report on market developments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing a welcoming statement and informing the audience about the schedule and topics to be discussed.


Passage number 4.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. If there are no clarifying questions, let me go next to Seth Carpenter to talk about the balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a simple expression of gratitude followed by a transition to the next speaker. There is no contention or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 5.
 MR. CARPENTER.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Earlier there was material distributed entitled “FOMC Briefing on Projections of the Balance Sheet, the Monetary Base, and Federal Reserve Income.” For this meeting, the staff has again prepared projections of the balance sheet under various alternatives.  Here we focus on the baseline and expanded purchase scenarios that were presented in the Bluebook.  The baseline scenario involves maintaining the currently announced limits of the FOMC’s asset purchase programs, while the expanded purchase scenario depicts a case in which the purchases of Treasury securities are expanded from $300 billion to $750 billion, consistent with alternative A from the Bluebook.  The staff sent the Committee a memorandum that projects Federal Reserve income using the baseline balance sheet projections and various assumptions for interest rates.  In this briefing, I will summarize the balance sheet and income projections. The charts in exhibit 1 illustrate the underlying assumptions for the baseline and expanded purchase scenarios.  The dotted lines present the projections made for the April meeting.  Several factors account for the differences from the previous meeting’s projections.  First, we have made some technical adjustments to our  assumptions for securities holdings, the most significant of which is a slower assumed prepayment rate for MBS.  As a result, MBS holdings end the projection period almost $200 billion higher than in our last projections.  Second, we have also adjusted our assumptions regarding the credit and liquidity facilities given the recent lower­than-projected usage. Most notably, as shown on the second page, loan issuance under the TALF has been revised downward significantly because of the experience with the facility to date and revised staff views of likely use in the future. As shown in exhibit 2, under the baseline scenario, the balance sheet peaks at about $2.8 trillion at the end of this year.  In subsequent years, TALF loans are repaid and securities mature, or are prepaid in the case of MBS, so the balance sheet contracts to just under $1.5 trillion at the end of 2016.  On the liabilities side, currency grows steadily and eventually returns to being the largest liability item. Reserve balances shrink reflecting the runoff in assets and the growth in currency.  Exhibit 3 presents the projections for the expanded purchase scenario.  The results are qualitatively similar, but total assets peak at a higher level at the end of this year and remain slightly higher than in the baseline for the projection period.  Corresponding projections for the monetary base are presented in exhibit 4.  Continued large-scale asset purchases lead to rapid expansion of the base from August through the end of the year, with annualized growth rates of around 100 percent. Early next year, the contraction of the balance sheet resulting from the cessation of LSAPs and the runoff of liquidity facilities causes reserve balances to shrink more rapidly than currency expands.  As a result, for each remaining year in the projection, the monetary base contracts. The substantial changes to the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet pose risks to the System’s net income that were summarized in a staff memorandum to the Committee dated June 17, 2009.  The memo concentrated on two risks. The first risk is that, as the policy rate is increased, the income that the Reserve Banks earn on largely fixed-rate assets becomes insufficient to offset expenses, most importantly the interest expense on reserve balances.  The second risk is the possibility that increases in interest rates reduce the market value of the SOMA portfolio so that, in the event that the Desk needs to sell some of these securities to drain reserves to raise the federal funds rate, the System realizes capital losses.  The analysis presented in the memo suggests that, using the baseline projection for the balance sheet, the first risk is not significant under most plausible scenarios, but the second risk is important to consider.   Exhibit 5 summarizes projections of Federal Reserve income and remittances to the Treasury under three different scenarios for interest rates.  The first row shows the baseline with interest rates consistent with those in the Greenbook, that is, the Greenbook as it was iterating on Tuesday, June 16, just before finalization.  The black line in the top left panel presents gross income for the Federal Reserve System, which is driven largely by interest income from the SOMA portfolio, and the red region represents total expenses, which is driven significantly by interest paid on reserve 3 The materials used by Mr. English are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). balances, which leaves the grey region as net income for the System prior to distribution of dividends. To the right, subtracting dividends paid on Reserve Bank capital and other transfers—the red region—leaves excess earnings that are remitted to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes, the grey region.  In the second row, which uses an interest rate path consistent with current market rates, remittances to the Treasury remain sizable and, in fact, exceed the average remittance to the Treasury over the past ten years. The bottom row, however, shows a scenario where interest rates rise sharply—in this case, the federal funds rate rises to as high as 8 percent by the end of 2011—and interest expense drives net income to zero, and, as shown in the bottom right panel, remittances to the Treasury are projected to be zero from 2011 to 2013. The memo also presented approximate unrealized mark-to-market losses for the SOMA portfolio, which are summarized in exhibit 6.  At the end of the first quarter of this year, the SOMA portfolio was in a modest gain position, illustrated by the blue line for the baseline starting slightly below zero—that is, with negative losses— because the legacy holdings of Treasury securities had an average coupon above market rates.  Under the Greenbook projection, longer-term interest rates do not rise appreciably above current levels until 2013, and the portfolio shifts to a modest loss position around that time. Under the market-based scenario, losses mount more quickly, and before long the portfolio has unrealized losses of about $100 billion.  As a result, if one-third of the portfolio were sold to drain reserves and so one-third of the total portfolio losses were realized, those losses could conceivably wipe out the remittances to the Treasury.  Under the high-interest-rate scenario, the red line, losses are even higher and mount more quickly.  In such a case, the sale of securities could quickly lead to significant realized capital losses.  As Jim and Spence will discuss, however, it is not necessarily the case that the Desk will need to sell securities, as other tools will be available when the Committee deems it appropriate to tighten the stance of monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides objective information about the projections of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, income, and potential risks. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 6.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let me turn now to Bill English to talk about the effects of high reserve balances on bank balance sheets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker is turning to Bill English to discuss the effects of high reserve balances on bank balance sheets.


Passage number 7.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, Bill. Let me turn now to Trish Mosser on large-scale asset purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging Bill and transitioning the conversation to Trish Mosser.


Passage number 8.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. At the last meeting I promised we would focus today a good bit on our exit strategy, that is, on how we’re going to unwind the policies that we have put in place. The last two presentations concentrate on that.  Let me turn first to Jim Clouse and Spence Hilton to talk about reserve management tools.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that the focus of the meeting will be on the exit strategy and introducing the speakers who will be discussing reserve management tools.


Passage number 9.
 MR. CLOUSE.4  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We’ll be referring to the package  entitled “FOMC Briefing on Reserve Management Tools to Target a Higher Policy  Rate.” The FOMC memo on reserve management options described a number of  possible tools that the Federal Reserve might employ to foster effective control of the  federal funds rate even with a much expanded balance sheet.  The operational details  of these various options were described in a series of accompanying memos, but it  may be useful to note how these various options fit within the usual demand and  supply paradigm in the reserve market.  In simple models, as shown by the red line in the top panel of exhibit 1, the hypothetical aggregate demand for reserves with interest paid on excess reserves at the so-called IOER rate should asymptote to just a touch above the IOER rate.  In practice, however, the actual demand curve seems to be more like the black line that extends somewhat below the IOER rate.  For much of the fourth quarter of last year, for example, federal funds regularly traded 50 basis points or more below the IOER rate. And in recent months, the effective federal funds rate has been about 10 basis points below IOER on average.  As best we can tell, this phenomenon has stemmed from a confluence of factors:  In particular, GSEs and others that earn no interest on overnight balances may have an incentive to lend in the funds market at rates below IOER; in addition, various impediments to arbitrage in the funds market—line limits, banks’ concerns about capital constraints, and possible adverse perceptions associated with significant overnight borrowing in the funds market—seem to have undermined the usual market forces that would ordinarily be expected to keep the federal funds rate close to the IOER rate. Consistent with this simple diagram, the various options discussed in the memo are classified under two basic headings—those that aim to strengthen and shape the demand for reserves and those designed to reduce the supply of reserves.  As shown in the middle panel, the demand-side options are aimed at shifting the demand curve to the right, or making the curve “flatter,” that is, more interest-elastic, around the IOER rate, or some combination of the two. Options aimed at shifting the demand curve to the right include increasing reserve requirement ratios and establishing a system of voluntary requirements.  Simple calculations suggest that increasing required reserve ratios under the current structure to the maximum levels allowed under the Federal Reserve Act—14 percent for transaction deposits and 9 percent for nonpersonal time deposits and net Eurocurrency liabilities—could increase required reserve balances quite substantially.  Alternatively, as noted in the work presented to the FOMC in April of 2008, the Federal Reserve could develop a system of voluntary reserve requirements.  Similar to the current program of required clearing balances, depository institutions in this system could establish a voluntary requirement ahead of each two-week maintenance period. The rate of remuneration for balances held to meet such voluntary requirements would need to be above the rate of remuneration on excess reserve balances in order to induce banks to establish a significant level of voluntary requirements.  Options that might tend to flatten the demand curve include the payment of interest on reserves for all account holders.  Payment of interest on balances held by institutions such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks would likely increase their desired holdings of Fed balances and could induce them to arbitrage in the funds market if the federal funds rate were to dip below the IOER rate. As described in the note by Jamie McAndrews, the Federal Reserve may also be able to flatten the demand curve by establishing special accounts that would allow federal funds transactions to be collateralized by balances held at the Federal Reserve.  As shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit, the various supply-side tools described in the memo—issuance of Fed bills, the development of term deposits, an expanded Supplementary Financing Program, expanded use of reverse repurchase agreements, and asset sales or scaled back liquidity programs—all would work by shifting the supply of reserves to the left.   In the case of Fed bills, this would be accomplished through the issuance of short-term debt obligations of the Federal Reserve that could be purchased by a wide range of investors.  Fed bills could be purchased by depository institutions but would not count toward meeting reserve requirements.  Fed bills would be a very powerful tool for reserve management for the Federal Reserve but would require new legislation. A closely related tool discussed in the note by Steve Meyer would be a system of term deposits.  Term deposits would be issued only to depository institutions, perhaps via an auction mechanism or by posted rates.  These term deposits would not be eligible to satisfy reserve requirements and likely would be structured as nonnegotiable instruments.  For example, two-week term deposits could be offered at the start of each two-week maintenance period.  Of course, the return on such deposits would need to be high enough to induce banks to shift a significant portion of their holdings of overnight reserve balances into a term deposit. As yet another reserve-draining mechanism, the Federal Reserve could explore an expanded SFP in which the Treasury would issue special bills and place the proceeds with the Federal Reserve.  To be fully satisfactory from the Federal Reserve’s perspective, the Treasury would need to be obliged to meet Federal Reserve requests for SFP issuance, and the bills issued under an expanded SFP should be excluded from the federal debt ceiling. Another reserve-draining mechanism that could be employed would involve expanded use of triparty reverse repurchase agreements with Treasury, agency, and agency-backed MBS securities. As noted in the background memos, reverse RPs against Treasury and agency collateral will be feasible in the very near future.  The ability to arrange for triparty reverse RPs against agency MBS may take longer to put in place—perhaps by the end of this year. In the case of agency MBS, a very similar reserve-draining mechanism would involve temporary sales of our MBS holdings in the dollar roll market.   Finally, the Federal Reserve could conduct outright sales of assets or take steps to scale back credit provided through various liquidity facilities.  These mechanisms would almost certainly be successful in draining reserves but, as Spence will describe, would entail a number of important policy judgments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 10.
 MR. HILTON. Thank you Jim.  If excess reserve levels were still high when the Committee again wishes to target short-term interest rates at levels above their effective minimum, then the starting point for raising market rates would likely be a   corresponding increase in the interest rate paid on excess reserves.  This is certain to put upward pressure on bank borrowing rates, including the overnight federal funds rate. Under improved conditions in financial markets, this by itself might well provide sufficient control over short-term rates, regardless of the levels of excess reserves. But if the Committee were dissatisfied with its control over market rates—that is, should something like the experience of last fall recur—then the Committee would want to be in a position to respond quickly to exert tighter control.  For this reason, development of some of the tools that have been described is proceeding, even in the absence of any certainty that they would be employed when the time comes to tighten policy. Among the various measures described above for reducing excess reserves, some appear to offer greater potential in terms of their scale or in terms of their availability in the near term than others.  Several options introduce other issues apart from narrowly operational ones that would need to be addressed before they might be employed on a large scale, and we are beginning to look at some of these.  And for all the tools aimed at reducing reserve supply, we are not certain about the level of excess reserves that would be consistent with tight control over the federal funds rate; however, we can be confident that large reductions in excess reserves would eventually increase their scarcity value and, with it, short-term market rates. I will now quickly review the feasibility of some of the options that Jim presented with these additional issues and challenges in mind. Issuing Fed bills or a revised Supplementary Financing Program exempt from debt ceiling limits are attractive options partly because, unlike reverse RPs, they avoid any need for collateral and its administration, which should also make it more appealing to a broader investor base.  But either approach would require legislative action that appears to be problematic at this point. Selling SOMA assets on a large scale is operationally feasible even today.  But use of SOMA asset sales as a key tool to drain reserves could be limited by the possible effects on longer-term interest rates that would be hard to predict and on trading conditions that such sales would likely have in those markets.  In addition, asset sales could have significant effects on Federal Reserve capital, as described by Seth. Arranging reverse RPs against SOMA assets, including agency MBS, on a large scale likely would require developing counterparty relationships beyond the traditional primary dealer ones.  The dealers themselves are not natural lenders.  They could act as conduit between the Fed and lenders, but their willingness to play this role could be limited because of the effect it would have on the dealers’ own balance sheets. Ideally, we would want to reach lenders to banks, especially those currently receiving less than the interest rate on excess reserves on their lending.  This includes  5 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).  the GSEs as possible counterparties, either as part of a broader reverse RP program or  via separate operations arranged with these institutions.  Arranging reverse dollar rolls with the agency MBS we accumulate is something  we could do now. We are uncertain about how large a presence we could have in this  market—this is something we are exploring—and the accounting treatment could  require us to realize any capital losses on the agency MBS we delivered even if just  on a temporary basis.  The counterparties for term deposit arrangements that Jim described are, of  course, the banks and other depository institutions directly.  At issue is what interest  rate incentive would be needed to induce depository institutions in the aggregate to  shift excess reserve balances into these term deposits, and specifically, how far above  the interest rate on excess reserves this rate must be.  It’s hard to calibrate depository  institutions’ demand.  But experience with interest rate corridor systems suggests that  maybe even spreads in the neighborhood of 50 basis points could incent banks to  place most of their excess reserves deposits into term deposits.  This same  observation also holds for the two options Jim mentioned for increasing banks’  demand for reserves:  the system of voluntary reserve targets or raising reserve  requirements.  In either case, the question to be solved is the rate of remuneration on  reserves held for these purposes relative to the interest rate on excess reserves.  To sum up, in the future under more normal financial market conditions, the  IOER framework could be a more viable tool for controlling the overnight federal  funds rate or other short-term interest rates than it appeared to be last autumn.   Moreover, some potential exists for improving arbitrage in funding markets to tighten  the relation between the IOER rate and overnight bank borrowing rates.  But the  System could bring additional tools to bear that collectively could be used to reduce  excess reserves on a large scale.  But apart from the remaining operational issues to  be addressed, developing some of these tools to their full potential could involve  additional issues, such as moving beyond traditional open market counterparties.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 11.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thanks very much.  And batting clean-up, Brian Madigan is going to talk about our credit and liquidity facilities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that Brian Madigan will be discussing credit and liquidity facilities.


Passage number 12.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very much, and thanks again to the staff for the extraordinary amount of very useful work behind these presentations. We will go over specifically what resolutions will be needed to address the program recommendations.  But before we go into Q&A, I just want to ask Trish and Brian what you’re asking for today. You’re asking for a vote, I understand, on the securities lending for GSEs.  The  other things that you mentioned, Trish—like the portfolio approach, tapering, hybrid ARMs—are you just looking for input at this point, or are you looking for a decision.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of gratitude and a clarification of what is being requested.


Passage number 13.
 MS. MOSSER. For the hybrid ARMs, we are looking for input.  It’s currently authorized, but we’d like the Committee’s views.  For the portfolio approach, if it goes across asset classes, it’s going to require very substantial communication by the Committee, I believe, so that’s really much more in the realm of the policy discussion, because it would be effectively making sizes flexible and fungible.  Regarding more flexibility within asset classes, again, under the current authorization, we have that authority, but we’d be interested in the Committee’s input.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they are looking for input and views from the Committee on certain matters.


Passage number 14.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Good. Questions for the staff.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a series of short statements and commands, indicating agreement and a desire for further information or discussion. There is no explicit mention of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 15.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, thank you.  I’d like to start with Brian. First, in your presentation, you did not mention—or maybe I missed it—that the pace of corporate bond issuance picked up. The spreads have come down—that was well covered—but tell us a little bit about the tone and the pace of the market.  Second, have rates themselves come down along with the narrowing of spreads.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for additional information and clarification from Brian.


Passage number 16.
 MR. SACK. The pace of corporate bond issuance has picked up.  May was a very heavy month, about $40 billion of issuance.  That strength seemed to spill into June.  Anecdotally we’re seeing this bond issuance used for a variety of purposes.  In part it’s being used to pay down bank loans and pay down CP. We are also seeing lots of holding of liquid assets.  This activity may just be some rotation or substitution on corporate balance sheets, but the pace of bond issuance certainly has picked up in response to the more favorable borrowing rates.  As your question suggested, certainly the collapse in spreads has been sufficient to outweigh the increase in Treasury yields. So, yes, corporate bond costs have declined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply provides information about the pace of corporate bond issuance and the reasons behind it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 17.
MR. FISHER. Trish, our stated objective was to lower private credit rates and to increase credit availability, and further in your presentation you mentioned two specifics on that.  One was obviously mortgages and the other was corporate credits.  So we might conclude that we have been successful on the corporate credit front.  Is that a fair assessment, or is it too early to tell.  When you talk about lowering rates in your presentation, Trish, I’m a little confused.  Our objective as I understood it was never to seek to lower rates on Treasuries deliberately.  It was to have an effect on the private credit markets.  Do I understand that correctly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher questions Trish's statement about lowering rates and expresses confusion about the objective of the credit market.


Passage number 18.
 MS. MOSSER. Yes, that’s correct.  For corporate bonds, clearly, both yields and spreads have come way down, not just because of our actions presumably, but particularly because of the recovery in equity markets.  I guess we can take credit for some of that.  On the mortgage side, however, the spreads are or became effectively as low as we reasonably believe that we could push them with both the agency debt and the agency MBS program.  That means that additional purchases are going to have very large side effects; as we have discussed in the past, that makes us very concerned about exit and about market functioning and keeping the market healthy.  So at this stage our ability to lower private credit rates in the mortgage sphere is extremely limited unless our impact in the Treasury market directly is bigger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the current state of yields and spreads in corporate bonds and mortgages. There is no conflicting or contradictory information presented.


Passage number 19.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I don’t know if you want to stick to that subject with other questions, or may I go ahead and ask the other.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 20.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. If you have other questions, go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 21.
 MR. FISHER. If I could quickly ask Jim and Spence—on the demand side, am I missing something here.  Wouldn’t the simplest solution be to seek an increase in reserve requirements.  What’s the drawback.  The paper outlines the pros, but it wasn’t clear to me what the cons are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and seeking clarification from Jim and Spence about the possible drawbacks of seeking an increase in reserve requirements.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 22.
   MR. CLOUSE. I will comment.  Spence may have some other points.  The existing regime for reserve requirements is very hard to rationalize.  It’s based on the monetary policy implementation of the early 1980s and very much focused on transactions deposits.  I think that using that kind of creaky, old structure to generate a huge increase in required reserves would be a little awkward. And then there are the communications challenges associated with why we would be raising reserve requirements by a huge amount, even though they are being remunerated—it still might be awkward to explain.  Spence may have some further comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that the existing regime for reserve requirements is hard to rationalize and that using that structure to generate a huge increase in required reserves would be awkward. This implies the speaker disagrees with the idea of a significant increase in required reserves.


Passage number 23.
 MR. HILTON. I would also point out the inflexibility to change the level and the inflexibility in terms of the scope that it provides the reserve requirement structure in banks in managing their reserve accounts.  I would agree that, yes, it would work in the technical sense of giving us some leverage over short-term interest rates, but I would say that, with the authority that we have to pay interest on reserves, we could do a lot better and come up with something that’s more flexible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the idea that the reserve requirement structure in banks is inflexible and suggests that there could be a better, more flexible solution using the authority to pay interest on reserves.


Passage number 24.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The Vice Chairman has a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: no. The statement is a factual statement and does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the Vice Chairman has a two-hander, which could refer to a type of weapon or a specific skill or talent possessed by the Vice Chairman.


Passage number 25.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I think another issue is, of course, that the reserve requirements wouldn’t fall precisely on those who have the excess reserves.  So you’d be creating a lot of frictional cost by doing it that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a concern about the potential frictional costs that would be incurred if the reserve requirements were to be imposed on those who have excess reserves. It does not contradict or argue against any previous information or opinion.


Passage number 26.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in the given passage.


Passage number 27.
 MR. KOHN. When we had reserve requirements on nonpersonal time deposits, it was kind of a nightmare administratively—there were too many ways around it, and it was very hard to define what was inside and outside. Now, we don’t have the tax on reserves that we used to have, but I still think it would be very, very cumbersome, and I’m not sure what the advantage would be relative to just paying interest on term deposits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their opinion and stating their uncertainty about the advantage of implementing reserve requirements on nonpersonal time deposits. There is no disagreement or contention present in this passage.


Passage number 28.
MR. FISHER. So the answer is no. Thank you.  And then a question for Brian Madigan. When we talk about an increase in the primary credit spread—and I realize you’re not recommending that currently—have you considered the effect it would have on smaller and regional banks.  At least through our discount window, we see some increased activity there, and we’re just a small part of the System.  So I wonder if we’ve taken that into account in that recommendation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely asking Brian Madigan about his consideration of the potential effect on smaller and regional banks if there were to be an increase in the primary credit spread.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 29.
 MR. MADIGAN. Very much so, I would say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The phrase "Very much so, I would say" indicates that the speaker, Mr. Madigan, agrees or strongly supports a viewpoint that was previously mentioned in the conversation. This implies a disagreement or contention between Mr. Madigan and another speaker.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 30.
 MR. FISHER. I’m just wondering if we’ve thought about the politics of this, now when they’re a little bit sensitive about a new consumer protection agency and so on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The mention of being "sensitive about a new consumer protection agency" suggests that there may be differing opinions or concerns about the establishment of such an agency.


Passage number 31.
 MR. MADIGAN. Well, not so much the politics, but the economics.  It’s not just the 11th District. I think there has been a fairly broad-based increase in terms of usage of primary credit by small institutions because they find the rate attractive.  The question is whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing. I think from the point of view of central banking, our general perspective in redesigning the discount window facility some years ago was to set up the primary credit program as a Lombard facility that institutions wouldn’t find attractive in routine circumstances but would turn to only as a backup.  Pricing the primary credit rate at a level that is consistent with that was one of the challenges in designing the primary credit program initially. It surely seems to be the case that as that spread narrows, exactly as you would expect, banks increasingly tend to use that as an ongoing source of funding, and that is, I think, the consideration that needs to be balanced.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the increase in the usage of primary credit by small institutions and whether it is a good or bad thing. There is no argument or disagreement presented.


Passage number 32.
 MR. FISHER. At the same time, we would be maintaining the TAF, but increasing the rate so that there would more of a penalty associated with it.  Did I understand that correctly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and confirming their understanding of a previously mentioned proposal.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 33.
   MR. MADIGAN. Possibly increasing the penalty. I think that is open for discussion at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is contention or disagreement as the speaker suggests that there is a possibility of increasing the penalty, while acknowledging that it is open for discussion. This implies that there may be differing opinions or arguments regarding whether or not the penalty should be increased.


Passage number 34.
 MR. FISHER. And who are the most active users of the TAF.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention or discuss any disagreement or contention. It simply asks a question about the most active users of the TAF.


Passage number 35.
 MR. MADIGAN. It’s used by some large domestic U.S. banks as well as by foreign branches.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that the technology is used by some large domestic U.S. banks as well as foreign branches.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 36.
 MR. FISHER. That would be one of my concerns—the optics of having a facility, which we, at least, have seen used by foreign branches, and maintaining it even though you might make it a little bit more difficult, while at the same time phasing out something that helps smaller and regional banks. I just wonder if there isn’t a conflict there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The speaker raises concerns about the optics and potential conflict of maintaining a facility used by foreign branches while phasing out something that helps smaller and regional banks. This suggests a disagreement or contention about the priorities and actions of maintaining the facility.


Passage number 37.
 MR. MADIGAN. My assumption is that the TAF would largely be wound down over roughly the same period of time.  The Federal Reserve might ultimately choose to maintain a TAF in the steady state, but at a very low level.  It wouldn’t be a significant source of funding for large banks, foreign banks, or anybody.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly presents Mr. Madigan's assumption and suggestion regarding the winding down of the TAF (Term Auction Facility) and the potential for a low-level TAF in the future. It does not include any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 38.
 MR. FISHER. If I may just ask one more question, Mr. Chairman, of Brian, which is on the FX swaps. In your judgment, to what degree have the comparable ECB facilities and the IMF lending program substituted for or buttressed or deterred the effectiveness of our program.  In other words, we see less demand currently.  Is it because of those two facilities.  Maybe your colleague to your right might have a view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked by one person (Mr. Fisher) to another person (Brian), seeking his judgment on the impact of certain facilities on the effectiveness of their program. There is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement present.


Passage number 39.
 MR. SHEETS. We have seen a dramatic decline in the outstandings under our swap facilities—from about $250 billion at the last meeting to about $120 billion now; and just one other historical data point is that the peak was around $580 billion in December.  My sense is that this sharp reduction really is a reflection of healing in global dollar funding markets.  I think the policies that have been put in place with respect to IMF lending capacity have been important   in soothing nerves of investors globally, but I think that’s more for the emerging market economies than, say, European markets, where the swap lines have been so important.  In addition, the ECB has some small swap lines with a number of European countries, but, again, I don’t see them as playing significantly into the demand for dollar funding.  The bottom line is that healing in the dollar funding markets has been the key driver there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is providing information and explaining their perspective on the decline in outstandings under swap facilities. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 40.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. The speaker is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 41.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, did you have a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a direct question asking about a specific action or event.


Passage number 42.
 MR. LACKER. Well, I was going to say that we tried increasing reserve requirements when excess reserve holdings were really large once in the late 1930s, and it didn’t turn out so well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 43.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It did sop up the excess reserves, though.  [Laughter] President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The laughter after the statement suggests that it is understood as a humorous comment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 44.
 MR. ROSENGREN. I have a question for Brian and Trish about your figure 5 on the large-scale asset purchases.  It’s interesting what a straight line that is.  Over the last six months, obviously, the economic forecast has changed—interest rates have moved, financial conditions have changed—and yet our program has been invariant to all of those changes.  So my first question is whether you think that you’re restricted from being able to do anything other than a straight line program.  I thought you had more flexibility, but I want to get your sense of whether you have the flexibility currently to be able to vary the amount that you’re purchasing or not.  I would say that, in talking to people in the financial community in Boston, one of the surprises was that the purchase program was invariant to the rise in interest rates that we’ve recently experienced, which certainly sent quite a message.  Did you debate whether you had the  flexibility to do anything to, in effect, resist some of that increase, both in the Treasuries and the mortgage-backed securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren expresses surprise and raises questions about the inflexibility of the purchase program in response to changes in interest rates and financial conditions. He suggests that there should have been a debate about whether the program could be adjusted to resist the increase in rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 45.
 MR. SACK. We have interpreted the directive as having some flexibility, but it is relatively limited, in that we varied the approach that we take to purchases and the pace of purchases to respond to problems with market functioning.  So we do vary the purchases to ensure that markets can continue to function and that we’re not causing too much strain in the markets.  One concrete example of this is that the approach to agency debt purchases has moved to a somewhat more flexible one that has reduced the pace and that raises the possibility of not getting all the way to the $200 billion because of what we’ve seen in the development of the functioning of that market.  So we’ve taken some limited flexibility in terms of responding to how markets function.   I think the more difficult issue is whether to exercise any flexibility in response to changes in market interest rates—that is, beyond the reaction to market functioning, whether the Desk should respond and try to resist increases in, say, MBS rates or Treasury rates.  There I think our view is that we certainly don’t have enough guidance from the Committee about the extent to which that responsiveness should be implemented or the yield levels at which purchases would ramp up.  We have not taken a dynamic market-responsive approach in that regard, and that’s why this is one of the issues that Trish raised in her briefing, namely, whether the Committee would like to consider moving to a more flexible approach.  She raised the issue of doing that across asset classes, but she also raised the issue of doing that within an asset class to be more responsive to interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker mentions that the issue of exercising flexibility in response to changes in market interest rates is a difficult one and suggests that there is disagreement within the Committee about the extent to which this should be implemented. The speaker mentions that Trish raised the issue of moving to a more flexible approach, indicating that there is contention on this topic.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 46.
 MS. MOSSER. One follow-up remark to that:  On a daily basis in implementing the MBS purchase program, particularly during the refinancing wave, we were sensitive to supply   and spreads, and we would buy somewhat more on certain days and a little less on other days.  But, to be honest, that shows up as a very tiny bump in the overall pace of purchases.  As long as spreads were continuing to narrow overall, we did not make very large changes from week to week and month to month in quantities.  Even though there was some daily movement, the changes we made were small ones. In the Treasury program, quite honestly, given its relatively small size, we didn’t feel that we had the flexibility nor that flexibility was necessarily a wise approach, since, frankly, it would not be credible, given chart 7—the size of it is just too small to have an appreciable effect on the level of yields. When we were being flexible in agency MBS, it tended to be in response to spreads more than to the level of yields.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Mosser, is suggesting that they had more flexibility in adjusting purchases in the MBS program based on supply and spreads, while in the Treasury program they did not feel they had the same flexibility or that it would have a significant effect on yields. This implies a difference in approach or perspective on the effectiveness of flexibility in these two programs.


Passage number 47.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman, you had a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is merely acknowledging that the Vice Chairman had something to contribute or discuss.


Passage number 48.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes, just very quickly. On the agency MBS, I think there is some notion that the rate of purchases will somehow be loosely linked to the amount of originations and the effect on spreads.  So we are a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of doing the $1.25 trillion, but that’s also because originations were very, very strong, and they’ll probably be weaker in the second half of the year.  So the purchases will probably slow down a little bit. To your point, President Rosengren, it would be really hard to accelerate purchases in response to a backup in yields, because that would then run into the conflict of having only so much authority over such-and-such a time period.  I mean, talk about potentially having severe cliff effects: I’m going to buy more as rates go up.  What happens if rates go up more.  Then I’m going to buy more, and then I’m also going to be out of ammunition.  I think actually putting  that in practice without the FOMC sort of dynamically altering the limits of how much the Desk could do would, I think, be very, very difficult.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing a factual explanation of the current situation and potential challenges related to purchasing agency MBS.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 49.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Well, we could always reload.  So there is an option.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is an option mentioned, which implies that there is some disagreement or contention. The speaker suggests the idea of reloading, indicating that there may be differing opinions or discussion about what the next course of action should be.


Passage number 50.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Right, but the Desk does not want to make a presumption that you’re necessarily going to reload, and it’s probably inappropriate for the Desk to make that presumption.  So I think it’s a pretty complicated thing to do in practice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the situation and what they think is appropriate for the Desk to do. It does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 51.
 MR. ROSENGREN. We do have a long tradition of leaning against the wind, and this program seems not to be very interested in leaning against the wind.  I thought you had enough flexibility to do that. Personally I would hope that you would have the flexibility to do that and that we might do a little bit more of it. In terms of your hybrid, I think it’s a very good proposal.  You did note it’s a very small part of the market, and, looking at data from McDash confirms that it’s an extremely small part of the market.  That is a part of the market where, if we wanted to push rates down more aggressively, we could do so with relatively low costs.  It seems that $1¼ trillion in mortgages is a lot to support market functioning.  So I actually have a broader goal than market functioning, which is to get the cost of housing down for people who might want to purchase houses. If we’re worried about market functioning in the 15- and 30-year area, it does seem that the 5- and 7-year area is one where there’s virtually no activity now; earlier this decade you could get a 7-year ARM for 4½ percent, no points, no closing costs.  We haven’t hit anything close to that in this period.  Given where the economy is, I don’t quite understand why those ARMs haven’t come down and why they’re not priced more favorably.  It may be reputational effects from the subprime market.  There might be a reason to stay away from 3-year ARMs, because the “3-27” has some connotations.  The 5-year and 7-year ARMs have the advantage of   being longer term while still meeting some of our balance sheet issues.  So you might want to give some thought to the politics of the choice between 3-year and 5- or 7-year.  But it would seem with the 5- or 7-year, we could lean against the wind and actually do more—we could actually try to push the rate low enough so that, if the 30-year mortgage were very high because of what was happening in the Treasuries, it would actually encourage housing purchases in that market without changing the magnitude of what you’re doing.  So I would like you to have a lot more flexibility to do that and possibly to push those rates down more aggressively than we’ve been willing to do with the 15- and 30-year rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage contains a disagreement between Mr. Rosengren and the program being discussed. Mr. Rosengren believes that the program should have more flexibility to "lean against the wind" and push rates down more aggressively, particularly in the 5- and 7-year ARM market, in order to lower the cost of housing. He disagrees with the program's approach of supporting market functioning rather than focusing on reducing housing costs.


Passage number 52.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thanks. Let’s stay in question mode for a while, and then we’ll have an opportunity for free discussion. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting to stay in question mode and have a free discussion later.


Passage number 53.
 MR. LACKER. I have a couple of things I want to ask about.  First, let me compliment the staff on providing us with a special abundance of interesting analytical reading over the weekend. Obviously a lot of work and thought went into it.  Let me first check something and then ask a question. In the projections of the balance sheet, there are two scenarios, but your projections for the use of credit facilities and liquidity facilities are the same in both.  Am I correct about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is complimenting the staff and then asking a question about the projections in a respectful manner.


Passage number 54.
 MR. CARPENTER. Yes. The difference between the two is not very big, partly because the liquidity and credit facilities are starting to wind down fairly quickly now over the next year or so. So we didn’t see that much reason to make significantly different assumptions about them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement of contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating that the difference between the two is not very big and that there was no reason to make significantly different assumptions about them.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 55.
  MR. LACKER. So you made the same assumptions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. It can be inferred from this statement that Mr. Lacker disagrees with the assumptions made by the other person mentioned in the conversation.


Passage number 56.
 MR. CARPENTER. That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement indicated. The response merely affirms the statement made by someone else without any contradiction or argument.


Passage number 57.
 MR. LACKER. I was thinking about it a different way, and I wanted to get your thoughts on this. The basic scheme here is, you write down our asset purchases, and then  program by program you have a sense of what you are going to project for usage, and then you add those up, and then you subtract currency, and you get reserves, right.  In the old days we did it the other way, right.  We used to think that if we drained reserves, for example, that would force banks to the window to borrow. So we used to think that you would take our assets, subtract currency, and there would be a certain demand for reserves, and the residual would be met by borrowing.  So you guys have turned it around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting two different approaches or perspectives on how to calculate reserves and borrowings, but there is no disagreement or conflict between the two perspectives.


Passage number 58.
 MR. CARPENTER. I would slightly prefer to think of it as that you guys have turned it around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Carpenter expresses a preference for thinking about a certain situation in a specific way. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement between him and others in the passage.


Passage number 59.
 [Laughter] MR. LACKER. This is the economics of the market.  I mean, we’re just changing policy here, right.  Let me explain why I’m thinking about it.  We monitor pretty closely the institution that leads your league table for holdings, and we monitor the liquidity management function particularly closely. They have $150 billion in balances with us.  They also hold a sizable portfolio—$70 or $80 billion—in general collateral Treasuries and agency MBS.  They view those two as really close substitutes as liquid assets.  By the way, I was a little puzzled that in one of the papers that talked about banks and lending, liquid assets never made an appearance and was sort of the residual, I guess. The institution is undergoing a review now. They’re rethinking.  What we hear is that they’re thinking of reducing their Fed balance now and increasing their holdings of agency MBS and Treasuries in order to get a higher yield.  That suggests a demand for reserves that’s determined by the relative yields of things.  Another observation I had is that over the last couple of months, we’ve ramped up asset purchases, liquidity programs have come in below expectations, and reserve holdings seem to have been sort of flat, all of which is kind of striking and also has the flavor of this other direction that I talked about.  Do you see what I’m saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their thoughts and observations without expressing any disagreement or contention with others.


Passage number 60.
MR. CARPENTER. I do. The logic underlying it, such as it was, was that the use of the facilities by depository institutions is by and large determined by economic and financial market conditions; that is, while financial markets are under strain, depository institutions will continue to borrow and other institutions will continue to borrow, and when things get better, they’ll borrow less. We’ve thought of that aspect of it as being roughly independent, and, for most cases, that seems to be borne out by the anecdotal information we get from markets. The particular institution you’re talking about, I agree, is quite different from a lot of the other institutions. That bank has a very large amount of reserve balances that it owns outright in some sense.  In addition, it’s also borrowing a reasonably large amount from the Federal Reserve. To me, that says that it’s choosing, as I think you characterized it accurately, its level of reserve balances as a specific target—this is how much it wants to hold, and it has some latitude to go up or down. Our reading on the rest of the banking system—the banking system in the aggregate—is not quite that way. The bulk of the activity in lending facilities involves not depository institutions but other institutions.  Their borrowing through the commercial paper funding facility, for example, shows up as a quantity of reserve balances, but it’s not a depository institution that has done that borrowing. If we wanted to get that set of reserve balances out of the banking system, there’s not a bank that would intentionally repay that borrowing to reduce their reserve holdings—it’s the CP issuer that’s doing it.  So, in that sense, we’ve separated most of the borrowing as a response to financial market conditions and economic conditions in constructing the reserve balances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear evidence of contention or disagreement. It mainly provides an explanation of the logic behind the use of facilities by depository institutions and the differences between various institutions' borrowing behaviors.


Passage number 61.
 MR. LACKER. In some of these programs, like the CPFF, counterparties are outside the banking system, but in the TAF, the primary credit facility, and to some extent the foreign  currency swap lines, those are all inside now.  Wouldn’t you think that how much a bank wants to borrow is determined in part by how much reserves they want to hold.  Now, to some extent, it’s an unfair question. We all recognize that in reality it’s a simultaneous thing—given the yields they see, they decide how much reserves to hold, and given their funding opportunities, they decide where to get the funds. But it seems plausible to me that they choose reserves, we buy assets, and that results in inflow of reserves to them; they don’t need to borrow them from anybody, they’ve got somebody else funding them essentially, and so they run off the borrowings. The reason I ask is that in the analytics you have shown us about that, you haven’t shown us anything about this link through reserves. When we’ve had this big discussion for several months now about the effect of these large-scale asset purchases, it has all been sort of microeconomic, financial market by financial market.  If this picture I’m drawing is right, then I wonder if there’s a channel that’s missing from your analysis.  For example, for Bank of America to hold more reserves, that means they’d have to want to hold less Treasuries and MBS, which means the yields on those would have to go down.  So we could be buying peanuts and Crackerjacks, and it would drive yields down.  Do you see what I am saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by Mr. Lacker and the speaker is asking for clarification or confirmation on certain points.


Passage number 62.
 MR. MADIGAN. President Lacker, I think we subscribe to pretty much all of the points you’ve made, but our ability to quantify the elasticities that you’re talking about, I think, is essentially nil. This is a good area for research and further thought, but this is what we could do in the limited time we had available.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Madigan acknowledges that he agrees with President Lacker's points but states that their ability to quantify the elasticities is limited. He suggests that more research and thought is needed in this area.


Passage number 63.
 MR. LACKER. I understand. Well, the reason I ask about this is that the focus is all supposed to be about exit strategy.  We’ve come through SCAP, and financial market conditions seem to be on the mend.  Admittedly there’s a lot of downside risk and a lot of uncertainty—is   the economy going to find its footing.—but it’s also conceivable that something like the Greenbook forecast comes about later this year and we get positive growth.  And it’s conceivable that banks’ ability to raise equity improves—this was left out of your analysis; you took equity as sort of an exogenous parameter.  But if banks find that, because of an increase in economic growth, there are some borrowers that they are interested in lending to, they could ramp up lending and expand equity. If we continue to buy assets and their need for funding collapses, so that the borrowing through our facilities collapses, we could get to the point where they’re holding all the reserves they want. Then there’s sort of a discrete change, where we’re pushing reserves up in a way that can’t be absorbed by changes in their borrowing.  So the concern I have is the possibility that our programs could get very stimulative very quickly.  That’s why I’m thinking about what the effect would be if they weren’t borrowing anything but we kept pumping reserves out there by buying assets.  Do you see what I am saying.  Is that a possibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement of concern and a question posed by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 64.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Don’t we have the ability to affect the rate at which people can borrow through the interest on excess reserves.  If that really became a problem, we would be able to affect that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the ability to affect the rate at which people can borrow through the interest on excess reserves. They also mention that if this were to become a problem, they would still be able to affect it. The statement suggests a level of agreement and confidence in the ability to control the borrowing rate.


Passage number 65.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. If that happened, the low short-term rates would be transmitted to longer-term rates, and you would see a decline in rates across the board, which would, of course, be stimulative.  But presumably the economy doesn’t respond immediately, and we’d be able to offset that by interest rate policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It presents a hypothetical scenario and the potential outcome if that scenario were to occur. The statement is not presenting any conflicting viewpoints or contradictory ideas.


Passage number 66.
 MR. LACKER. Would we want to add reserves at $100 billion a month or so and raise the interest rate on reserves at the same time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward statement or question that does not indicate any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 67.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No. I assume that if we came to an exit point and started raising rates, we would no longer be buying assets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is stating a hypothetical scenario and expressing their assumption about what would happen in that situation. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 68.
VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. All of the asset purchase programs are “up to.”  They do depend on the conditions at the time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is explaining that the asset purchase programs are contingent on the conditions at the time, indicating flexibility in their implementation.


Passage number 69.
  MR. LACKER. Well, I just worry.  Banking is sort of sitting there with a certain amount of borrowers. I’m worried about a flip back to the classic model in which we pump in reserves and they lend it, and it’s stimulative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show contention or disagreement. It expresses the speaker's worry and concern about a possible return to a certain model in banking.


Passage number 70.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. The other problem is that they’re still balance sheet constrained in terms of the amount of capital they have relative to their assets.  You can see that in a wide variety of areas; for example, the spread of jumbo mortgages relative to conforming mortgages is still very elevated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a problem or constraint without any conflicting viewpoints or debate.


Passage number 71.
 MR. LACKER. But presumably their ability to access equity markets is going to improve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a statement about the expected improvement in the ability of a certain group to access equity markets.


Passage number 72.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We hope we’re successful in this regard.  President Hoenig has a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The statement does not present any contention or disagreement. It expresses a hope for success and mentions President Hoenig having a two-hander, but it does not indicate any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 73.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, and this is a question for you, just to clarify.  I understand where Jeff is coming from, but when I read these papers and I listen to these presentations, I think we have more than an exit strategy discussion going on here.  Eric has kind of drifted onto one discussion about managing rates.  Another is around managing the portfolio—how we adjust. Then there is the exit strategy, which has two dimensions, but I think we are only discussing one. The first dimension is the traditional monetary one of how you get the fed funds rate up. The second is around large-scale asset purchases, which we’re not really talking about today, since we still have this line showing our holdings going up and the only thing is how we are going to adjust the line going up, but that is not an exit strategy.  That is about how we are going to manage going up that line; that is the concern, I think.   So I wonder if it would help to split these up when we are talking.  I mean part of this is about managing the rate, which is different than exit strategy, and it would help clarify when we get into the discussion part of the meeting to say which one we are going to focus on first.  Right now I think we are focusing on all three intermittently here and back and forth, and I think that will cause maybe more confusion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker (Mr. Hoenig) is expressing disagreement with how the discussion is being conducted. He believes that there are different aspects to consider (managing rates, managing the portfolio, and the traditional monetary dimension) and suggests that the focus should be clarified to avoid confusion.


Passage number 74.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, were you finished.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 75.
 MR. LACKER. I had two smaller things to ask about.  One had to do with MBS spreads. This past intermeeting period is one of those episodes where convexity-related hedging, that is, selling in the Treasury market, was a widespread feature of commentary, and it has happened many times before in the last decade or so.  The picture you get, and let me check this, is that there are a lot of holders of mortgage-backed securities who hold a lot of Treasuries.  So they’re active in the Treasury market and they’re active in the MBS market. Is that a good picture, a fair picture.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 76.
 MS. MOSSER. They may have Treasury securities that they could sell.  They also have the ability to short them.  They can also do similar portfolio adjustments in the swaps market, which, through follow-on effects, through other trading mechanisms, will affect Treasury yields.  So they can pay fixed on swaps.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply describes various actions that can be taken by individuals or entities in the financial markets without presenting any disagreement or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 77.
 MR. LACKER. So this is broadly speaking a set of financial market participants very active in MBS markets and very active in Treasuries as well.  They would seem to have the ability to look at the spread and make decisions at the margin about buying and selling Treasuries or MBS based on their view of the proper level of the spread or where the spread is headed, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of fact describing the actions and abilities of financial market participants.


Passage number 78.
   MS. MOSSER. Well, the convexity hedging phenomenon, particularly in the current episode, was actually more concentrated in servicers and not so much in MBS investors themselves, although I’m sure there were a few of those that were selling convexity.  Servicing portfolios have even more convexity than mortgages, so, dollar for dollar, it doesn’t take a big change in their duration to cause someone who is hedging to sell either a lot of swaps or a lot of Treasuries. One reason for the speed is that there are many servicers, they have really, really similar portfolios, and they all go in on the same day or two and conduct the same sorts of trades in the same direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is providing explanation and stating facts about the convexity hedging phenomenon.


Passage number 79.
 MR. LACKER. I’m less interested in convexity-related trading per se than the linkages between the MBS and the Treasury markets.  There are a lot of players taking a position on the spread, and I’m wondering what we know that they don’t know about where the spread should be. So, analytically, on what basis would we make a judgment that the spread is too low or too high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal interest in understanding the linkages between the MBS and the Treasury markets and questioning whether they have any unique insights or information about the appropriate spread. There is no conflicting viewpoint or disagreement presented.


Passage number 80.
 MS. MOSSER. Two things. We used history.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is stating that they used history for two things, without providing further context or expressing any opposing views.


Passage number 81.
 MR. LACKER. This is history they can see, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement rather than a discussion, so there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 82.
 MS. MOSSER. But we used the long history of spreads to Treasuries to make a judgment about how narrow they were.  We also considered whether there was anyone else who was buying for investment purposes, in other words, anyone else who was willing to come in and actually purchase them to hold besides us.  If we were the only long-term purchaser, we took that as a signal that we had lowered spreads to the point that they were not attractive to other investors.  That was the place that we were before the convexity hedging episode, and it’s one of the reasons that we were already beginning to slow down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a logical analysis of the spreads to Treasuries and the consideration of other investors' willingness to purchase them.


Passage number 83.
   MR. LACKER. A related question: One of the memos was pretty eloquent about the need for greater clarity and better communication about our strategy.  Is there any chance that providing the Desk with more flexibility about the composition of our asset purchases could diminish rather than enhance market understanding of our strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking a question about the potential impact of providing more flexibility in asset purchases on market understanding of the central bank's strategy.


Passage number 84.
 MS. MOSSER. I believe that flexibility could be a very successful strategy, but it would need substantially more clarity about the Committee’s views and literally its reaction function, for lack of a better term, which may be very difficult to do, given how far out we are in uncharted territory.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It is a statement expressing a belief and recognizing potential challenges.


Passage number 85.
 MR. LACKER. One final question about the interest rate on reserves and the reserve management tools:  Does the staff think it’s at all likely that the effective funds rate would not be brought up pretty much in tandem if we raised the interest rate on reserves under current arrangements.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for the staff's opinion on the likelihood of the effective funds rate not being brought up in tandem with raising the interest rate on reserves.


Passage number 86.
 MR. CLOUSE. I think there’s an excellent chance that it would rise.  We just don’t know whether it would go up by an 80 percent factor or a 90 percent factor—that remains to be seen. So I think it’s very prudent to examine all of these other tools.  We just really are in uncharted territory, especially with hundreds of billions of dollars in reserve balances outstanding.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the potential increase and suggesting that it is wise to consider other tools because the situation is unfamiliar.


Passage number 87.
 MR. LACKER. Have you thought about whether we care about the federal funds rate per se, that is, if the interest rate on reserves is more relevant than the weighted average you calculate every day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked to gather information or clarify a particular viewpoint.


Passage number 88.
 MR. HILTON. I think it’s a good question. What does the rate represent.  What does the gap represent.  Does it represent a rent that banks are extracting, or does it represent their   own spread aligned with their borrowing rates and their lending rates.  I think that’s a legitimate question, and in my mind it’s an open one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. Mr. Hilton is expressing his viewpoint and acknowledging that the answer is open-ended and subject to interpretation.


Passage number 89.
 MR. MADIGAN. The experience last fall, though, gives you some reason to think that the fed funds rate is relevant. The fact that the substantial spread between the interest rate on excess reserves and the fed funds rate seems to be reflected in other market interest rates like LIBOR, CP, and so on, suggests that it’s not solely the IOER rate that’s the relevant margin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact and suggesting that the evidence supports the idea that the fed funds rate is relevant, based on the correlation between the spread between interest rates on excess reserves and the fed funds rate and other market interest rates like LIBOR and CP.


Passage number 90.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply acknowledges Mr. Lacker's gratitude.


Passage number 91.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 92.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a couple of questions.  On this strategy for dealing with the large-scale asset purchases, what are other central banks doing.  I notice the Bank of Japan is doing just a certain amount per month.  And the Bank of England just did what we did—they announced a total. But are they varying within that total.  Are they exercising flexibility or is the process pretty mechanical.  Are there any lessons for us from what they’re doing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for information and clarification.


Passage number 93.
 MS. MOSSER. It’s our understanding that it’s fairly mechanical.  Now, a couple of times the Bank of England has bought so much that they were afraid that they were reducing liquidity in the market, and they have slowed down again from a market functioning standpoint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information about the Bank of England's actions and concerns regarding market liquidity.


Passage number 94.
 MR. KOHN. Sort of like what we have done with the MBS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple statement of similarity or comparison, indicating that what has been done with MBS (mortgage-backed securities) is similar to something else.


Passage number 95.
 MR. MOSSER. Yes. But they absolutely are much more focused on a reserves or a money target than the SOMA purchases have been.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the subject being discussed (reserves or money target) is of higher importance compared to SOMA purchases.


Passage number 96.
 MR. SHEETS. The Bank of England has moved at a pretty regular pace of about £25 billion a month.  One place where I think they do have a little bit of flexibility that they have chosen not to utilize is in the composition of the purchases; they have the gilts approved, but they   could also buy corporates and commercial paper, yet the vast majority of their purchases have been in the gilts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 97.
 MR. KOHN. Other central banks have found it difficult, as have we, to specify the reaction function, I suspect. Brian, you mentioned that Treasury supply is driving up Treasury rates, but my impression is there has been no news on Treasury supply.  It’s a very common thing to hear, but I wondered.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kohn acknowledges the difficulty in specifying the reaction function for central banks and expresses his impression about the lack of news on Treasury supply. However, there is no active disagreement or conflicting opinions presented in the passage.


Passage number 98.
 MR. SACK. I agree. I think for this intermeeting period, most estimates of borrowing needs of the Treasury didn’t rise.  So I would say that’s more of a “backdrop” condition, not the main driver of the rising yields over this intermeeting period.  But it’s certainly a very important factor over a broader time period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement of agreement and clarification.


Passage number 99.
 MR. KOHN. And finally for Seth, are there any consequences of not covering our expenses.  Can we pay dividends.  Do we continue to pay salaries.  [Laughter] For the Governors we can do that out of spare change—the vending machine receipts will pay the Governors’ salaries—but what about for the rest of you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a light-hearted question about potential consequences of not covering expenses and the possibility of paying dividends and salaries.


Passage number 100.
 MR. SACK. If you’re going to go down that road, you should make the salaries responsive to the upside as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 101.
 [Laughter] MR. CARPENTER. That sounds like a profit-sharing plan for the Fed employees.  The accounting treatment is that once there’s no net income after paying dividends and that sort of thing, we stop remitting money to the Treasury.  What happens if we can’t even make the dividend payments to the member banks.  The Reserve Banks would not pay their dividends to the member banks, but they would have to make that up in subsequent years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Carpenter raises a concern about the possibility of not being able to make dividend payments to member banks and questions what would happen in that scenario.


Passage number 102.
 MR. KOHN. It’s cumulative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that something is cumulative without providing any contrasting views or arguments.


Passage number 103.
 MR. CARPENTER. It’s cumulative, exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The word "cumulative" suggests that Mr. Carpenter is agreeing or confirming something mentioned previously. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning of the statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 104.
   MR. KOHN. Are they forced not to pay dividends, or is that a choice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker is questioning whether the company is being forced to not pay dividends or if it is a voluntary decision.


Passage number 105.
 MR. CARPENTER. My recollection is that it’s a choice, and part of it comes from Board direction to the Reserve Banks. Then the question becomes how long this goes on; it ends up accumulating through time, and then in subsequent years it just takes that much longer before we start getting back to normal.  We have to save up earnings.  The accounting for it is still being evaluated.  There’s some view that some of the remittances that have already been paid to the Treasury could be recouped by booking an asset that’s essentially a prepayment, and then that might be able to be pushed back an extra year; the accountants in the System are working on the actual treatment of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating information and discussing possible accounting treatment.


Passage number 106.
 MR. KOHN. If we get into this situation, there’s nothing mechanical about it that would impinge on our independence.  We could continue to meet our responsibilities.  President Bullard and I were at a conference where a lot of academics were worried, I think, that if we didn’t meet our expenses, something awful would happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 107.
  Something awful may happen, but-- MR. BULLARD. Just to follow up on that, are there examples of foreign central banks that have been in a position like this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individual is simply asking for examples of foreign central banks in a similar position.


Passage number 108.
 MR. SHEETS. There have been a number, I think, that have had to turn to their treasuries to be recapitalized.  I don’t have a lot of details about those experiences at my fingertips, but it’s something that has happened before, and there are some precedents we could look into.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact and suggesting that they could look into previous instances for more information.


Passage number 109.
 MR. BULLARD. My sense of this, then, is that you are at the mercy of the Treasury.  If they’re merciful, then they recapitalize you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states an observation or opinion about being dependent on the Treasury's decisions.


Passage number 110.
 MR. KOHN. Well, no.  What I was getting at was that I didn’t think you were at the mercy of the Treasury, but rather that it was our choice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Kohn is clarifying his previous statement and expressing his viewpoint.


Passage number 111.
 MR. BULLARD. That’s not the foreign experience.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 112.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the dividends are one buffer.  Beyond the dividends, presumably, and the capital, then you would be at the mercy, I would imagine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No - The passage does not contain any obvious contention or disagreement. It simply presents different elements that act as buffers in a given situation.


Passage number 113.
 MR. MADIGAN. I don’t think that’s clear.  I mean, there’s nothing that says necessarily that a central bank can’t operate with negative capital.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Madigan simply expresses his opinion that it is not clear whether a central bank can operate with negative capital.


Passage number 114.
 MR. SHEETS. And I would bet that we could also find some examples of foreign central banks that did have negative capital. You know, it can be a little uncomfortable.  For the cases that I can think of, they have eventually gone to their treasuries to seek recapitalization, but I think there’s a range of experiences out there with this that we can look at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply stating that there may be examples of foreign central banks that have had negative capital and sought recapitalization from their treasuries. It does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 115.
 MR. PLOSSER. There’s nothing that says they can’t operate, but do you think the political environment is such that something dramatic might happen in response to that, given what has gone on in this episode.  I would think that would be the bigger risk, not the accounting treatment.  It’s the political force.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply presents an opinion and raises a question about the potential political response to a situation.


Passage number 116.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. This is not going to happen in the intermeeting period.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is stating a fact or prediction rather than presenting any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 117.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I hope not.  The issue from my perspective is that it’s political. In other words, the day that you find out that you’re no longer remitting positive balances to the Treasury, there’s a nice, juicy news story, and then they go evaluate:  Why did this come about.  Because the Fed engaged in these large-scale asset programs and because of asset–liability mismatch.  Was that prudent for the Federal Reserve to do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their hope that there is no contention, and then provides their perspective on the issue. They discuss the potential political implications and question the prudence of the Federal Reserve's actions. However, there is no explicit disagreement or conflicting viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 118.
  MR. CARPENTER. Just to clarify a bit, what we sidestepped in the analysis was the fact that the remittances are actually made currently by individual Reserve Banks, and it is very, very common for an individual Reserve Bank not to have sufficient capital to equate with surplus and to make a remittance to the Treasury.  Over the past decade or so, it’s been something like 40 weeks per year that at least one Reserve Bank hasn’t made a remittance to the Treasury.  So it’s not as though this is something that is completely unprecedented for the Federal Reserve.  What would be very different here is that it would happen for the Federal Reserve System as a whole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explains that it is common for individual Reserve Banks not to have sufficient capital to make a remittance to the Treasury. However, the speaker also mentions that it would be different for the Federal Reserve System as a whole. This suggests that there may be disagreement or differing opinions on whether the entire Federal Reserve System should be experiencing a lack of remittances to the Treasury.


Passage number 119.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans, do you have a two-hander on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking President Evans if they have a two-hander on a certain topic or issue.


Passage number 120.
 MR. EVANS. Well, I had a question that was related to Governor Kohn’s question on this. Do we have a particular attitude towards mark-to-market losses, that is, capital losses, versus having our net income go to zero.  That was one of the more striking graphs, a very extreme example.  I would have thought that there would be an accounting entry that would allow us to continue to fund whatever we needed to do, but the political issue seems to be an important one.  It would be well known along the way, so that people would see it coming, but some of these tools would involve capital losses right away.  Would that raise a similar red flag in terms of our balance sheet.  Would we be worried about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and seeking clarification on the topic of mark-to-market losses and capital losses.


Passage number 121.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I think it’s a consideration.  First of all, you wouldn’t want to be selling huge amounts.  Second, you probably could mix different assets of different vintages and do things of that sort. But I think it is a consideration that we should pay attention to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not exhibit contention or disagreement. The speaker is presenting their own perspective and offering a potential course of action to be considered.


Passage number 122.
 MR. EVANS. My question was really: Do any of the reserve management tools have better attributes than others.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking a question and seeking clarification.


Passage number 123.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Most of them—like reverse repurchases, things that don’t involve actually selling the assets, but rather involve financing them in different ways—don’t have the capital loss component.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply stating that most of the transactions described, such as reverse repurchases, do not involve a capital loss component. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 124.
 MR. EVANS. We will lose money on them, though, right.  Because presumably the interest rate we have to pay on the repo is going to be higher than the income that it’s earning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention. The speaker is suggesting that they will lose money on the repos because the interest rate they have to pay on the repo is higher than the income it is earning, implying a disagreement or concern about the potential financial outcome.


Passage number 125.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, that’s the point.  If it gets to 8 percent, then we’re in a loss position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or arguments that suggest disagreement or contention. It simply states a hypothetical scenario and expresses a fact or assessment about it.


Passage number 126.
 MR. EVANS. Yes, right, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 127.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn, were you finished.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 128.
 MR. KOHN. I’m finished.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 129.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay.  President Stern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 130.
 MR. STERN. Thank you. I’ve got a couple of questions.  The first one is on the exit strategy, and the second one is a little more tangential.  With regard to the expiration dates for these liquidity facilities, if we extend them to February 1, 2010, what kind of commitment and communication are you thinking about so that they actually do end then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement and does not express any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating that Mr. Stern has a couple of questions.


Passage number 131.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Maybe I could intervene.  There would be a press release Thursday, which we’ve been working on, and we can show you a draft.  Here are the proposed final sentences of the introduction: “The Board and the FOMC will continue to monitor closely the condition of financial markets and the need for and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s special liquidity facilities and arrangements.  Should the recent improvements in market conditions continue, the Board and the FOMC currently anticipate that a number of these facilities may not need to be extended beyond February 1.  However, if financial stresses do not moderate as expected, the Board and the FOMC are prepared to extend the terms of some or all  of the facilities as needed to promote financial stability and economic growth.  The public will receive timely notice of planned extensions, discontinuations, or modifications of Federal Reserve programs.”  That’s the kind of language that we were trying to communicate—not too definitive, but clearly raising the possibility there won’t be any further renewals.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the proposed final sentences of a press release and expressing the intention to communicate a certain message.


Passage number 132.
 MR. STERN. Okay. The second question is about the TALF and the quantities.  I gather we now think TALF volumes might go to $175 billion whereas heretofore we were up around $500 billion, and I think earlier we even had a larger number.  Is all of that consistent with the objectives of this program.  Where is this coming from.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply highlighting a change in the projected volumes of the TALF program and questioning its consistency with the program's objectives.


Passage number 133.
 MR. NELSON. I think partly it’s experience as we work with the program.  It’s an awareness that as ABS markets improve, we’re not going to need as much TALF activity to support them. It’s becoming consistent with what we’re seeing in CMBS markets.  Right now the numbers we’re putting down for TALF 2.0 peak at $50 billion, which is about what we think is going to be needed for CMBS, and with TALF 1.0 it’s—I forget the numbers that we actually put down—but it’s a more modest $125 billion, which is where we see activity at its current pace ending in the first quarter.  So it’s consistent with the policy objectives.  It’s just accumulated experience.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing their thoughts and observations about the program and its future needs.


Passage number 134.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 135.
 MR. HOENIG. Just quickly, I want to go back to Governor Kohn’s original question on the accounting. In this document there is a discussion about investments held in consolidated variable-interest entities, with a conservative assumption that we could take a $5 billion hit and then no more losses after that, even if interest rates went up pretty significantly.  Is that a conservative assumption.  That is, if interest rates went up significantly, wouldn’t you expect more losses out of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning whether the assumption made in the document is conservative or not.


Passage number 136.
   MR. CARPENTER. It has been the stated policy that it’s expected that these assets will be managed through time to recover everything, so in that sense the official view is that there will be no losses.  Given that, the estimate is conservative—it’s taking on more losses than was originally expected by the policy itself. The other part that’s not obvious to me is the effect if, for example, interest rates rose.  If that increasing rate was because the economy as a whole was getting better and financial markets were healing and everyone thought the outlook was very, very rosy, then the underlying value of some of those assets may no longer be distressed.  Some of the write-downs are because of the strains in financial markets.  You could imagine cases where some of those assets increase in value because the economy is turning around and the outlook is brighter, and it’s exactly those sorts of multivalent influences that caused us to throw up our hands somewhat and take the coward’s way out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation and discussing different potential scenarios and outcomes.


Passage number 137.
 MR. HOENIG. Went to neutral.  Okay. The second question is also related to the earlier discussion. In some of the accounting that I’ve seen and what I believe I saw discussed in here was the establishment of a prepaid account to the Treasury to go back and, therefore, bring your surplus up so you could continue to pay your dividends and so forth.  Are those only allowed under special circumstances, or would those be allowed in any kind of a loss circumstance, so they would enable us to continue to pay dividends.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement by Mr. Hoenig, not a point of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 138.
 MR. CARPENTER. Right now what’s envisioned is the case where losses were sufficiently large that capital would go negative.  What has been written into Reserve Bank accounting policy is the ability to create a prepaid asset for things that have happened year to date. They are currently working on ways of going back not just year to date, but the prior year as well, so that would be used in the event of losses where you wouldn’t have enough retained earnings to equate surplus with capital paid in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply outlines the current policy and plans regarding accounting for losses and creating prepaid assets.


Passage number 139.
 MR. HOENIG. That would address part of Governor Kohn’s concerns about continuing to pay for operating expenses and continuing to pay dividends.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any conflicting or opposing viewpoints. The speaker is addressing the concerns raised by Governor Kohn and suggests a solution that would address those concerns.


Passage number 140.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions President Plosser without providing any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 141.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a few questions. Some of them have been touched on already, but let me just see if I can get some clarifications.  One question is for Brian, and it’s related to your conversation with Eric about SOMA lending of agency debt and the liquidity in the market.  You said that one of your reactions so far has been that you have kind of slowed down the purchases. In fact, if you’re worried about the liquidity of that market and we’re soaking up all of the liquidity, what’s wrong with another option, namely, to stop buying.  Why create a program where we’re buying them and lending them back out again. Why not just not buy them in the first place and let the liquidity of the market deepen as we move forward.  Is there something wrong with that strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is questioning the strategy of buying agency debt and then lending it back out again. He suggests an alternative strategy of not buying the debt in the first place. This implies that there is disagreement or contention regarding the current strategy and its effectiveness.


Passage number 142.
 MR. SACK. Well, I think it’s quite possible that we will exercise the “up to” part of the mandate regardless of whether we’re lending the agency securities or not.  I think the desire to lend the agency securities is in response to concerns about market function, which would be there whether the program ended at $100 billion or $150 billion or $200 billion.  In either case, SOMA holdings are going to be a sizable portion of the benchmark GSE market, and, as I said, we’re already hearing reports from the market about concerns about shorting and not enough floating supply of these issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and opinions about the program and the potential concerns in the market.


Passage number 143.
 MR. PLOSSER. That’s because we are buying them, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 144.
MR. SACK. That’s because we are buying them, right.  It’s a matter of degree.  So I agree. If you don’t get to $200 billion, you lessen the problem, but I think we would pursue the authority to lend our agency holdings regardless of whether we thought the program was going to end before $200 billion or get all the way to $200 billion.  We’re already seeing these strains.  We think making these holdings available to the market makes sense in terms of supporting market functioning, treating these assets the way we treat other SOMA holdings, and, as I said, posing little risk to the Federal Reserve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement of agreement and intention.


Passage number 145.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. This is about making sure that you can deliver a specific issue. It doesn’t affect reserves or the stance of monetary policy, I don’t think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of opinion without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 146.
 MR. PLOSSER. No, I was thinking purely in terms of the liquidity of the market, which I thought you were concerned about.  If we are heavily into buying in these markets and taking those assets out of the market, and there are some liquidity problems for some of these issues, then all we’re doing is turning around and lending them back out again to help liquidity.  It seems like we’re giving with one hand and taking away with the other.  I’m just trying to understand a little bit about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is simply seeking clarification and expressing his understanding of the situation.


Passage number 147.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You might not know ex ante which things are going to have liquidity issues in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that it is not possible to predict which things will have liquidity issues in the future. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 148.
 MR. PLOSSER. I’m not necessarily opposed to the program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker states that they are "not necessarily" opposed to the program, indicating that they are open to the possibility of supporting it.


Passage number 149.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Having a lending program allows you to accommodate those shortages that might occur ex post.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states that having a lending program allows for accommodation of shortages that might occur ex post. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 150.
 MR. PLOSSER. Another question. On the winding down of some of the liquidity procedures, there are some specific recommendations that are made about the TAF auctions and some others about mixtures of extending the dates, cutting back auction sizes, and/or changing   prices in some form.  I’m curious about how the staff thinks about the right mixture of controlling prices versus quantities, the tradeoffs.  I mean, October is still what, five months away. In thinking about when is the right time if we thought we wanted to extend, how much in advance do we need to do that.  Is there an option of continuing to sort of just proceed with gradually ramping up prices or costs of these programs to encourage the users to wean themselves off of this and go back to the market.  Then we would not make the decision to extend maybe for—I don’t know—a little longer or wait a little while to see whether or not we can wean these players off and into the market.  So thinking about the mix of both price and quantity controls, I guess I was looking for some insight as to how do you pick between those two and the tradeoff versus extensions or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and insight on the right mixture of controlling prices versus quantities and the trade-offs involved.


Passage number 151.
 MR. MADIGAN. I think it is, unfortunately, a fairly complicated situation, so it’s difficult to give a simple answer to your question.  For one thing, we have both standing facilities and auction facilities, and they’re really very different in terms of their philosophy and what you might think their purpose is and how to unwind them.  An auction facility, pretty much by construction, can be unwound primarily just by reducing the amounts offered, whereas to make a standing facility less attractive, obviously you’d increase the interest rates or otherwise make the terms less attractive.  To some degree what we’ve proposed here has included elements of both of those—for instance, making the terms less attractive in the case of the AMLF by requiring the redemption threshold, and reducing the auction amounts in the case of the TAF.  They’re just two very different facilities that require different approaches.  As we noted in the memo, it’s not really feasible to scale back the AMLF by raising the interest rate on that particular program. On the timing, that’s a difficult question.  I think one consideration is that, as we get closer to the termination dates of programs, market participants will be deciding whether or notto lend to particular counterparties, depending on whether that counterparty is going to have the option of turning to the Federal Reserve to repay the investor or the lender.  That argues at least for a significant lead time in notifying the market as to when these facilities are likely to go away.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is providing an explanation and discussing the complexities of the situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 152.
 MR. PLOSSER. What I was thinking about was the pace.  Take the TAF, for example— the recommendation is to cut from $150 billion to $125 billion, and maybe or maybe not to raise the minimum bid rate.  Why don’t we cut to $100 billion immediately.  It’s undersubscribed by a substantial amount. Why not move the minimum bid to something closer to the interest rate on excess reserves rather than making it so far below it that we’re subsidizing, at least in the current environment.  We’re sort of mixing those two things up, trying to figure out what the right balance and strategy are, or how aggressive one wants to be in this process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: There is disagreement in the passage regarding the pace and strategy of cutting the TAF (Term Auction Facility). MR. PLOSSER suggests cutting it to $100 billion immediately and adjusting the minimum bid rate, while also questioning the current approach of mixing those two aspects. This implies a difference in opinion or contention about the appropriate timing and actions to be taken.


Passage number 153.
 MR. MADIGAN. Right. It is very much a matter of judgment, I think, including how aggressive you think is appropriate at this point, given circumstances that arguably remain very fragile, with the banking system still under a lot of strain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 154.
 MR. PLOSSER. Well, I worry particularly about the TAF—it’s so dominated by a couple of banks, and I don’t want to confuse supporting a couple of banks with the broader purpose of sort of what these bank programs might be doing. I wanted to make a couple of other points—and Jeff made both of these in a different form.  One is the communication issue.  If you provide more flexibility to the Desk to do some of this stuff, communication is going to be really, really, really difficult, and we may be accused of being less transparent rather than more transparent about that.  So I think that’s going to be a very tough task.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is expressing his concerns and thoughts, but there is no indication of opposing views or conflicting opinions being presented.


Passage number 155.
 MS. MOSSER. Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In this passage, Ms. Mosser agrees or confirms the previous statement.


Passage number 156.
MR. PLOSSER. The other point is on the interest on excess reserves.  It’s certainly true that there’s a possibility that as the markets and the economy begin to recover, we’ll have a lot of excess reserves sitting out there. And the opportunity cost to banks may be, “Okay, when can I make a good business loan at 8 percent or 7 percent.”  And they view the risk tradeoffs for that as the right ones. We may be faced with a situation, even if we thought interest on excess reserves worked perfectly, where we would have to raise the IOER very aggressively to choke off that massive amount of liquidity that may be just sort of running out into the marketplace.  If interest on excess reserves isn’t working as we’d like to see it work, then we are going to have to combine that with some other mechanism for draining those excess reserves.  The question is: What’s the relevant interest rate that’s going to guide us in some of those moves.  And I think that’s very difficult to sort out, even with the tremendous job the staff has done—there’s a lot of forest and a lot of weeds here in trying to sort through the details.  But I do think it’s important that we try to make sure that if Plan A doesn’t work, we have a Plan B.  That is, we need to make sure that if IOER doesn’t work as we hoped it would, we have other mechanisms to drain the reserves.  But we may have to do that at a very rapid pace, which may mean some of these mechanisms that you suggest may operate more quickly and are more easily implemented than others, and that might be a consideration that we have to think about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Plosser discussing the potential challenges and considerations regarding interest on excess reserves and the need to have alternative mechanisms in place.


Passage number 157.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser, I think there are two mechanisms that prevent this thing that you’re worried about from happening overnight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are two mechanisms in place to prevent a specific thing from happening overnight.


Passage number 158.
 MR. PLOSSER. I don’t think overnight, but it may be a period of months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement by Mr. Plosser regarding the time frame.


Passage number 159.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The first one is that, assuming that we have the power to raise interest rates, which is what this whole discussion is about, then rates on longer-term securities will reflect the expected path of future policy rates and, therefore, will not go to zero.   So to the extent that there’s an expectation over the next three years the Fed will be raising rates at a reasonable pace, that will limit the amount that the supply price of credit can fall.  That’s the first point. And then, the second point is, of course, that, although financial markets move quickly, all of our models tell us that the economy itself moves somewhat more slowly.  With a large output gap, it’s going to take some time certainly for the economy to reach its full potential.  And I understand all of the issues with the output gap, and so on, but I don’t want to leave the impression that this is something that’s going to require a turnaround within a matter of weeks.  I just don’t think that’s a real concern.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting two points and providing explanations for each point.


Passage number 160.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I’d like to compliment everyone on the new audio system, although it picks up the Blackberry noise pretty well, too.  On the reserve management tools, I’ve read your speeches and heard you describe them with quite a lot of energy. We’re looking at quite a number of tools, and yet I wonder how different they are in terms of their ability to achieve what we want.  What I have in mind is that the interest on reserves tool by itself—especially with the elements that are designed to help the GSEs somehow earn interest on their reserves—seems powerful enough, so that that should work.  But what if, for some reason, it doesn’t work.  Maybe somebody could describe the elements of the other markets that we’re expecting to take advantage of that somehow would provide an independent channel that would help out. For example, would the reverse repo market really work very well in an environment where the banks seem not to be arbitraging the interest on reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Evans expressing his compliments and raising questions about the effectiveness of different reserve management tools. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict between individuals.


Passage number 161.
 MR. HILTON. If we are seeing a gap between the rate that banks are earning on excess reserves and what they are paying, I think that I would approach that situation as really an arbitrage opportunity for us. If we’re talking about reverse repos as the tool, as long as we have the collateral and we can basically get to those depositors directly or even indirectly, then that   would be the mechanism that we would use to grow the reverse repo market.  But in contemplating the potential scale for the operations, I don’t think we should believe that we are necessarily limited by measures we currently have of the size of that market.  Rather, it’s a matter of how many reserves we want to drain and who it is that is earning a rate from the banks that’s well below the interest on excess reserves and therefore would be interested in lending to us at a slightly higher rate. So that’s how we would simultaneously lift rates and manage down the size of the banks’ balance sheets, that is, bring down excess reserves and some of their liabilities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily discussing a potential arbitrage opportunity and the potential use of reverse repos as a tool to grow the reverse repo market. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented in the passage.


Passage number 162.
 MR. EVANS. As I was thinking about this, it seemed that one attractive feature is that the money market mutual funds would be potential customers here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states an idea or opinion that money market mutual funds would be potential customers.


Passage number 163.
   MR. HILTON. We have thought of them.  We haven’t approached them about it.  But in terms of thinking of a pool of liquidity, that might fit the kind of description I provided, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is acknowledging that they have considered a pool of liquidity that aligns with the described description, but they have not yet approached anyone about it.


Passage number 164.
 MR. EVANS. Okay. So there’s no obvious reason to think that, when the banks are not taking up these arbitrage opportunities, there’s some underlying feature that also would make the money market mutual funds somehow reluctant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact and asking for confirmation.


Passage number 165.
 MR. HILTON. I don’t believe so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Hilton states that he doesn't believe there is anything to argue about or disagree with.


Passage number 166.
 MR. EVANS. Well, they’re not designed to.  I’m just trying to think in terms of the risks that we might face.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply presents Mr. Evans' statement without any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 167.
 MR. CARPENTER. One extra bit of data that might help with that specific question is that, even in the past couple of days, and in the past months, when the effective federal funds rate has been right at the top of the zero to 25 basis point band—or we would just say right up against the rate on excess—it has been associated with the repo rate being above the excess rate, that is, at 27, 28, 29 basis points. And we’ve been hearing that that has been causing some of thisshifting of funds that might have been lent unsecured into the secured funding markets.  So I think that is very much in line with Spence’s point about the repo market being a way for us to take care of some of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing additional data that supports a previous point made by Spence regarding the repo market.


Passage number 168.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states "Okay. President Bullard" without any conflicting statements or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 169.
 MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to see if I have this right about exit strategies. And I have to say Brian Madigan’s memo here on liquidity facilities is a masterpiece of clarity, so thank you for that, Brian. It’s super clear what we’re going to do and what we’re thinking about with each program, why we’re thinking about it, why we’re thinking of the different options.  And when I look at large-scale asset purchases, it’s much less about exiting, and maybe it’s a little bit about coping.  But I expected to see more about what we could do if we wanted to reduce our holdings, and all I see is that we’re going to have to sell.  So my question for Trish is this:  Is the bottom line that the plan is basically buy and hold.  In other words, when we’re buying now, we’re basically committing to a very large balance sheet for a very long period of time, and then the other stuff is all a question mark about what that means in terms of macroeconomics, that is, whether it’s worrisome or dangerous or not.  But as far as the balance sheet itself, it’s ramping up, and we don’t see good ways to mitigate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 170.
 MS. MOSSER. I have two responses—at least two.  The first is that certainly “buy and hold” has been the staff’s maintained hypothesis when we do Seth’s pictures of the size of the balance sheet. And if we’re going to be reducing excess reserves in the future, while we could do it through selling, probably our first step—and I think this would be the staff’s bias—would be to use the reverse repo market in order to manage to a higher federal funds rate.  So that’s my first response—as a baseline, probably yes.  However, there are a couple of caveats to that.  It does very much depend on how the Committee wants to react to whatever the macro and financial conditions are at the time we are exiting. One can imagine a scenario, the really high-inflation scenario that Seth played out, where the Committee might very much want to tighten financial conditions in the broad economy very quickly.  Selling a really large quantity of assets very quickly would probably achieve that for you, no matter how we manage the short-term interest rate. So I think it’s very dependent on the Committee’s views at the time that exit comes around. It’s possible to do, but the question is:  Will that be what the Committee wants to do, both with the size of the balance sheet and in terms of influencing financial conditions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing possible approaches to managing the balance sheet and influencing financial conditions, but there is no explicit disagreement or contradiction presented.


Passage number 171.
 MR. BULLARD. If you get into a high-inflation environment, it’s too late.  We’ve already failed at that point. I can believe at that point you might want to take more radical action, but the idea is to get this optimal path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion that if we reach a high-inflation environment, it is already too late and more radical action might be necessary. The statement is not presenting a conflicting or opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 172.
  MS. MOSSER. We have been purchasing these securities on the upside very quickly, with the intent of influencing private credit rates.  On the exit side, at the point we would decide to sell, we have been going with the assumption that we would exit much more slowly in the optimal case.  We would sell very slowly and in small quantities—this is not built into Seth’s baseline, but we could do this—in the way that we have been purchasing Treasury securities for decades, which is to buy regularly, in tiny amounts, being as market-neutral as humanly possible.  That can be achieved, but that’s a slow unwinding.  It’s faster than what’s built into Seth’s pictures, but it’s quite small.  A big year would be $50 billion or $70 billion on the purchase side, on the upside, in the old days. So we would assume that size on the downside.  So it’s not a rapid way to bring down the balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their strategy for purchasing and selling securities, and there is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 173.
  MR. BULLARD.  Earlier this spring we were thinking of having Fed bills or a Treasury program that would mitigate this problem.  But those are now politically off the table.  Is it correct to think that now that they’re off the table we have basically committed to a large balance sheet. That’s the way I read these memos.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement made by MR. BULLARD about a change in policy.


Passage number 174.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. They wouldn’t affect the size of the balance sheet.  They’re just alternative ways of financing, which is what we are talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing that the alternatives being discussed do not impact the size of the balance sheet, but rather refer to different methods of financing.


Passage number 175.
 MS. MOSSER. Fed bills, or doing reverse repos for that matter, wouldn’t shrink the balance sheet, they would simply shrink reserves; that is, they would affect the liability side of our balance sheet, but not the asset side—the assets would still be just as big.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact about the impact of fed bills and reverse repos on the balance sheet. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 176.
 MR. PLOSSER. Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage provided only includes a name and title. It does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 177.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage as it only includes the mention of President Plosser without providing any specific information or context that would indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 178.
 MR. PLOSSER. I have a very brief intervention, because it’s related exactly to this point. Brian, a little earlier when I asked you the question about agency debt, you said that you presumed we were going to go to the limit on that.  Is it the expectation of the Desk and the markets that the operative words of “up to” certain amounts in our policy statements are basically irrelevant, and that, in fact, we’re viewed as committed to going to those amounts and we wouldn’t consider doing less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in Mr. Plosser's question to Brian, where he challenges the presumption that they will go to the limit on agency debt and questions the relevance of the phrase "up to" certain amounts in their policy statements.


Passage number 179.
 MR. SACK. Actually, what I said before was that the Desk may exercise the “up to” part of the directive. And what I meant by that is that we may not get to the entire $200 billion on account of these concerns. Now, the question is:  What does the market expect.  We actually changed our procedures for accepting tenders on agency debt in a way that we think is going to taper off the pace and perhaps leave us short. I would say this hasn’t garnered a ton of market attention. There may be a period during which they have to learn and adjust to that, or it may just not be that big of a deal.  So I think the markets understand we have some flexibility.  They haven’t reached a definitive conclusion that the SOMA holdings may fall well short of $200 billion. But presumably over the next several months there will be increasing inference in that direction, if things evolve the way we expect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily an explanation of the speaker's previous statements and the potential impact on the market.


Passage number 180.
 MR. PLOSSER. Do you think the same is true for the MBS and Treasuries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for the opinion of someone else.


Passage number 181.
 MR. SACK. I think the purchases of the Treasuries have been regular and steady and nonresponsive to market conditions, and that’s very well understood at this point in the markets.  For MBS, I think what happened is that, over this intermeeting period, the markets learned that the Desk was less responsive than they anticipated.  The current MBS secondary rates reflect that understanding.  It’s just that the adjustment of how they got there was perhaps lumpier because of that learning. I think the secondary MBS rates stayed lower for longer, because there was this assumption about more Desk responsiveness, and they then had to adjust up more abruptly.  But on net, it’s at a point where the markets seem to understand that the Desk is exercising only limited discretion in terms of making those purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply provides an explanation of the market conditions and the actions of the Desk.


Passage number 182.
 MS. MOSSER. One comment: On the primary dealer survey that we do before every meeting, we did ask this question about probabilities of increasing versus decreasing.  We didn’t really ask the “up to” part, we just asked whether the sizes might be decreased.  In all three categories, there was some weight put on decreasing the size of the programs.  If I’m recalling the numbers correctly, it was smallest for the Treasury program, but that’s partly because it’s scheduled to end in September, and it’s closer to being done.  But there is some weight being put on decreases in size, meaning not getting all the way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 183.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 184.
   MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  To continue the grilling of Brian and Trish, my interpretation in sort of street terms of what you said earlier is that the directive has been a problem for the Desk for last few weeks.  And we’re in somewhat extraordinary times where you may have been uncomfortable—I’m putting words in your mouth—that you were making policy as opposed to interpreting the wishes of the Committee.  Can you be more explicit about what you’d like to see in a directive that would work, and yet at the same time deal with the external communication sensitivities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a request for clarification and further explanation, without any opposing viewpoints or arguments being presented.


Passage number 185.
 MS. MOSSER. Okay. I’ll take a stab at that one.  I don’t know that it is so much that we didn’t have a sense of what the Committee wanted, although there were times when perhaps we didn’t have perfect clarity, but rather it’s that I don’t think the public and the markets always understood. For example, there was discussion in the market that the Treasury purchase program was going to be immediately expanded in the middle of May—in an intermeeting period—and extended and enlarged substantially as Treasury rates continued to rise.  In fact, this was a shockingly widely held opinion, despite the Chairman’s public statements that were close to being to the contrary. So, on the communication issue, everyone understands that these are very unusual programs, but it would be good to clarify what your expectations are in terms of the direction of what the programs are likely or not likely to do.  For the Treasury purchase program, in particular, there’s a bit less clarity.  For the MBS program and the agency program, the markets have now figured out that, up to a point, narrowing spreads was the goal.  As for going further than that, the Desk is likely to step back and say, “We’re not going to become the 100 percent only investor.” But they learned that by watching what we were doing as opposed to getting a communication from the Committee.  If your preference is “steady as she goes” through the end of the programs, subject to the caveat that if conditions improve the Committee may use  the “up to” option, then that would help as sort of a basic starting point.  Beyond that, it depends on what the Committee’s true views are about the ultimate goals of the programs and whether they should be enlarged or kept the same size.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It mostly discusses the need for better communication and clarity regarding the Federal Reserve's programs.


Passage number 186.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I can build on that.  Could you imagine language like, “…will respond to market conditions, spreads, and the pace of issuance,” or something like that.  Would you recommend something like that.  Would you propose something like that.  If so, you need to think about that. Is that what you had in mind, President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 187.
 MS. MOSSER. If the Committee is comfortable with the option that I spoke about in my presentation for flexibility within asset classes and agrees with our assessment that, subject to this sort of communication, it would be useful, then that would be the right kind of clarifying statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker is presenting an option and seeking agreement and understanding from the Committee. There is no mention of disagreement or contention in this statement.


Passage number 188.
 MR. SACK. I would say that, if the Committee is comfortable with the degree of flexibility that the Desk has been exercising, then I would leave it alone, in terms of public communications at least. To the extent that you start to change the directive, it’s going to involve a lot of guessing about what has changed and what’s going to happen now.  I think the market has gone through a learning process that may have caused some abrupt movements here and there, but it has gotten to a point where it pretty much understands that the general approach is slow and steady, with some flexibility around that in response to market functioning.  And if that’s what the Committee is comfortable with, we’re at a point where we don’t need any kind of public clarification. If the Committee wanted the Desk to be more responsive to market interest rates, then that would require some kind of communication to the market, so that they didn’t have to infer it over time just from our actions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and suggesting that if the Committee is comfortable with the current approach, then there is no need for public clarification.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 189.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I think many of us on the Committee would be looking to you to tell us if you think there’s a strategy that, for a given amount of purchases, would achieve better results, and, if so, what that is and how you would recommend communicating about it.  I think we have to rely on your market knowledge to do that.  So if you do believe that’s the case, perhaps for the next meeting or before then, you could present us with some alternatives.  But if you think where we are now is fine, that’s good, too.  But let’s not fail to take advantage of some improved operating process, if it gives us better results.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The members of the Committee are expressing different opinions about whether there is a need for a new strategy or if they should continue with the current approach. There is contention because one group is advocating for exploring alternatives while the other suggests that the current situation is satisfactory.


Passage number 190.
 MS. MOSSER. Assuming the “up to” sizes stay where they are, I think I agree completely with Brian, particularly regarding the Treasury program, where we simply don’t think anything other than “slow and steady” is probably the appropriate implementation strategy given its current size and its current expiration date.  We are already, frankly, moving in the direction of more flexibility, as Brian described, on the agency debt program, and we’ll continue to move that way, assuming that the spreads don’t widen and we don’t get dislocations in the opposite direction.  If flexibility is going to be useful, it would be in the MBS program, and, obviously, we’d be happy to write down a couple of alternatives for the next meeting.  It might help clarify the language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing agreement and discussing potential options for the MBS program, but there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 191.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states "Thank you. Vice Chairman." There is no contention or disagreement present in this statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 192.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Another alternative may just be to clarify in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, rather than coming up with a whole new vehicle.  It could just provide a bit more language about what the intent of the programs is and about our thought processes. From my perspective, the statement and the minutes are not great vehicles for communicating about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker suggests an alternative approach to clarify the Humphrey-Hawkins report, instead of creating a new vehicle. This implies a disagreement or contention with the idea of creating a new vehicle for communication.


Passage number 193.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: The provided passage does not contain any statements, arguments, or opinions that could suggest contention or disagreement. It simply states the title and name of Chairman Bernanke without providing any further context.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 194.
 But if we’re departing from what we’ve been doing, we want the Committee to— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I’m assuming that we’re going to stay on the same path.  I still think it would be useful to have something in the Humphrey-Hawkins report that explains what this is. And then, if we depart, I agree, I think we’d have a different directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker initially assumes they will stay on the same path, but then acknowledges the possibility of departure from that path, which suggests a difference of opinion or uncertainty.


Passage number 195.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, did you have a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The text is a question directed towards President Lacker, asking for a comment or response.


Passage number 196.
 MR. LACKER. Yes. I think you are right, Mr. Chairman, to ask the Desk for their suggestions as to language that would help them achieve the results we desire.  A corollary to that is that they understand the results we desire. My interpretation of what we decided when we embarked on this was to achieve whatever improvement in MBS yields would result from the quantity we sketched out, not to peg yields at a given level, not to dampen fluctuations in yields, not to reduce the dispersion of future yield outcomes, and not to respond in the way the markets seem to expect us to respond.  We didn’t put that in the directive, obviously, and we didn’t put that in the statement either.  In preparing for this meeting, I looked at the statements and read them from the perspective of the intermeeting period, and it strikes me that there are things in the statements that markets could have latched onto that led them to misinterpret what results we desired to achieve. I think that’s useful to keep in mind.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing his agreement with the chairman's suggestion and providing his interpretation of what was decided. He also suggests being mindful of how the statements could be misinterpreted by the markets. However, there is no indication of a disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 197.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That’s fair enough, but there may even be technical issues, like not wanting to be the only buyer, and things of that sort, that we would want to communicate. Other questions.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply presents a statement about potential technical issues that may arise, without any conflicting opinions or arguments being expressed.


Passage number 198.
 MR. LOCKHART. Mr. Chairman, really a question for you, not for this side of the table.  The Treasury proposed that it would have the last call in approving 13(3) authorizations.  Have we developed a view on that and communicated that in any way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lockhart is simply asking a question to the chairman about whether a view on the Treasury's proposal has been communicated.


Passage number 199.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. As I mentioned, I would like to defer that to lunch tomorrow, but I will present all of these issues and tell you about the report and the other aspects that we’ll start undertaking, and then cover it at that time.  Other questions.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their preference to discuss a topic later and promising to provide information on it at that time.


Passage number 200.
 MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought someone might ask this, which is why I didn’t get in the queue. Brian, what kind of reaction do you expect from markets and economic commentators to the press release the Chairman is working on.  He read us part of the draft on the modifications to the various liquidity facilities.  Specifically, do you think there’s much of a chance that it will be read as, if not the beginning of tightening, the lifting up of the screwdriver and placing it against the screw.  [Laughter] I’d also be interested in what Brian Sack and Trish think about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed to Brian about his expectation of market and economic commentator reactions to a press release.


Passage number 201.
 MR. MADIGAN. First of all, it is complicated, and I think it will take a while for people to understand all of the elements, assuming the Board and the FOMC follow the staff recommendation.  A second point, though, is that it will be read very much in the context of the announcement tomorrow and what that says about your intentions with respect to the federal funds rate, the asset purchases, and so on.  In some sense that will really very much condition the reaction, because, among other things, that will give the economic backdrop, the rationale, for how the Committee is approaching monetary policy at this stage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement of opinion and analysis by Mr. Madigan.


Passage number 202.
 MR. SACK. I would add that without the sentences that the Chairman read, it’s a somewhat mixed release.  At least one program is being scaled down, but others are being extended, so the direction is not really clear.  I think the focal point of the markets would be the sentences that were read about the extended date being the expected terminal date, and I do think there’s some risk that that will be seen as the first step—as you said, “lifting the screwdriver.”  So it is a risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their interpretation of the information provided and stating their opinion on the potential risks involved.


Passage number 203.
   MS. MOSSER. I would agree with that. It is a small risk.  Because of this renewal, the swap partners are aware of at least that portion of the press release, although not of the rest of the liquidity facilities, obviously. We informed them that some language along the lines of what the Chairman read would likely be in the press release.  Their reaction in a number of cases was: “Oh, well, we’re not going to put anything like that in our press release,” and a couple of them were outright concerned about it.  So there was a dispersion—some thought it was fine, and others not. I would agree with Brian—I think there is a risk.  I don’t know that it’s large, but there is a small risk that it would be viewed as a bit of tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Mosser agrees with the idea that there is a small risk, but others have different reactions and opinions about it.


Passage number 204.
  MR. TARULLO. I presume that, if you had thought of this, you would have already suggested it, but does anything come to mind that would allow us to mitigate that risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting that the person being addressed may have already suggested a solution to mitigate a certain risk.


Passage number 205.
 MS. MOSSER. The last sentence that was added to the press release, which says the Board and the Committee would also consider expanding if things get worse, helps to mitigate that risk quite a bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is providing an explanation of how a specific sentence in a press release helps to reduce a certain risk.


Passage number 206.
 MR. TARULLO. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 207.
 MR. SACK. The statement is conditioned on anticipated further improvement that hasn’t really been defined. So I think it leaves open some issues.  If conditions just stay where they are, does that mean the programs will be extended.  How much improvement is expected.  And so on. I would just say it’s complicated to signal that so far in advance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. MR. SACK questions the lack of clarity and definition in the anticipated further improvement and raises concerns about the conditions and expectations of the programs being extended. This indicates disagreement or contention with the statement being discussed.


Passage number 208.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions President Lacker without providing any information or context that would indicate contention or disagreement. Confirmation or denial of contention cannot be determined based on this single mention.


Passage number 209.
 MR. LACKER. Is the risk all to the downside.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only states a question and does not provide any information to indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 210.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I think it’s mixed—there are extensions going on as well as some trimming back.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is both extension and trimming back happening, indicating a mixture of actions or opinions.


Passage number 211.
   MR. LACKER. Yes. But is termination also potentially a signal of the confidence we have in the economy and financial conditions.  Is there a chance they’d interpret it that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is posing a question and seeking clarification on whether termination can be interpreted as a signal of confidence in the economy and financial conditions.


Passage number 212.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m not sure I want to litigate this here, although I’d be happy to have discussions with people. It’s very conditional.  If I could once more read just part of it: “Should the recent improvements in market conditions continue, the Board and the FOMC currently anticipate that a number of these facilities may not need to be extended beyond February 1. However, if financial stresses do not moderate as expected, the Board and the FOMC are prepared to extend…” and so on. President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is stating different conditional scenarios without taking a clear position.


Passage number 213.
 MR. HOENIG. I have a clarifying question on the discussions around exit strategy and the LSAP. Would there be, then, a discussion at each meeting as to whether we should go to the “up to” limit.  In other words, should there be a specific decision whether to go forward.  I think you have to address that before you start talking more generally about raising the fed funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 214.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly. That’s part of the policy strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any argument or disagreement. It simply states that there is a policy strategy that includes some form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 215.
 MR. HOENIG. All right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information that indicates contention or disagreement. 


Passage number 216.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. In just a minute we can take a coffee break, if that is okay. When we come back, we will have a bit more discussion among the group on the issues that were raised by the presentations. Let me just try to identify three topics that we might want to talk about. The first one is Brian’s recommendations on trimming back the various facilities or extending facilities. We’ll have to take some Board and FOMC votes on that.  You have Brian’s handout that shows the recommendations of the staff.  So if anyone has thoughts on any of those, that would be the first issue that I would suggest.   The second is the set of issues related to exiting from our expanded balance sheet and raising interest rates.  Let me just say that many people have called for us to communicate more about this, and I think that’s very important.  The current plan is for the Monetary Policy Report, which will be issued in a few weeks, to have a section which will describe, in some more detail than we’ve given so far, the tools we’d be looking at to achieve the exit.  We don’t want to put in things that are very speculative.  But to the extent that the Committee is comfortable with things like reverse repos, and so on, we’d want to describe those in that section.  So any thoughts or comments about the relative value of different methods or concerns would be useful. And then, the third topic would be just the things that Trish and Brian were raising and that President Hoenig alluded to, which is thinking about the asset purchase strategy.  Even if we don’t change our position at this meeting, do we want to begin thinking about a tapering strategy.  Do we want to advise the Desk to change its reaction function.  So we can discuss things related to that set of issues. Of course, whatever else you want to bring up is fine, but I thought those three areas might be worth comments in the free discussion period. Before we do that, why don’t we refresh ourselves with about a fifteen-minute coffee break.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply outlining the topics of discussion for the group and suggesting areas for comments and thoughts.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 217.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The floor is now open for people who’d like to make comments on the three topics I mentioned before the break or anything else that the presentations brought to mind.  I want everyone to have a chance to speak, but I do hope we can get to the economic presentation today.  If we can do this in 45 minutes or so, that would be very helpful.  Would anyone like to start off.  Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is a clear indication of disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker expresses the hope to move on to the economic presentation and mentions the time constraint. This implies that there may be potential disagreement or resistance from the attendees to stick to the agenda or prioritize the economic presentation.


Passage number 218.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Plosser.


Passage number 219.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On your three questions, I agree with much of what Governor Warsh just said.  In terms of exit strategies, I think the staff did a terrific job in thinking through this and in the very elegant way they laid out the options.  In my own personal view, I think we could be a little more aggressive in either cutting quantities or moving minimum bids up in some combination, particularly for the TAF and even for some of the others, in terms of the haircuts. In general, I’m very supportive of the strategy.  The only thing I was very disappointed in was the GSE facility.  That facility came on not quite a year ago.  It has never been used. The Treasury got funding to support the GSEs.  I would have liked to have seen that facility rescinded back in September or October after the Treasury got funding.  I still think it ought to be rescinded. I don’t think that is a place we ought to be.  I do think the announcement of these modifications to the facilities and particularly the language in the press release that the Chairman read will, in fact, be positive for the economy as a whole.  There may be some places in the markets that will lose the subsidies that some of these things might be providing, but on net I think it will be a good signal to the marketplace. On the tools for managing the balance sheet, again, there were a lot of interesting ideas.  I think many of them could work.  I would just like to reiterate how strongly I feel about not wanting to have Fed bills. It is a bad idea, not because it can’t manage the balance sheet, but because I fear that it poses incredible political risks to the System.  It’s an opportunity for interference, an opportunity for the Congress and the political parties to view this as another way to intrude on Federal Reserve policymaking.  Although we may ask for the autonomy to make those decisions, that doesn’t necessarily guarantee that they will grant it.  I have expressed this view before. I feel very strongly about Fed bills as not a good way to go in this environment; many of the other tools, though, such as reverse repos and others, could accomplish much the same thing, and I would encourage us to continue to work on those and the other options, because they entail much less potential political risk. On the LSAP issues, I agree with almost everything Kevin just said.  Our objectives, I thought, were fairly clear; that is, we’re not targeting a price or a yield.  The markets seemed to believe that we were. I think we would be well served, as was suggested, by clarifying it, perhaps in the Chairman’s testimony in July, to try to reinforce that and disabuse the markets. I was struck by some of the other things that the Desk was talking about.  I want to read a couple of sentences, and I quote: “Staff sees evidence of both stock and flow impacts from our experience so far, although we cannot be certain of the precise mechanism by which they work, or if the effects are permanent or transitory.  That leaves a considerable degree of uncertainty in designing and implementing the LSAP programs.”  That suggests to me we don’t know exactly what we’re doing or how it’s working, and so that argues against flexibility and the notion that we’re going to go in there and play some game to raise this yield or lower that spread when, in fact, we don’t know how these mechanisms are working.  So I guess I would steer away from the flexibility.  I think that the “slow but steady” path is just fine, and that we can clarify that we are not targeting a particular yield or price, but rather we’re encouraging market functioning and liquidity, and leave it at that.   In terms of the expansion, we still have a lot of purchases we could make if we wanted to.  I’m opposed to going out and authorizing more purchases of agency debt, MBS, or Treasuries at this point. I don’t think we need to make that decision right now.  And if anything, things are looking somewhat better.  So I would oppose that. I would also be against this notion of going in and buying hybrid ARMs or creating options. I think we do that because we can.  It’s not clear to me what the objective is.  We have been pretty unclear as to exactly how effective we have been in some of these markets on some of these prices and yields and what exactly the impacts are going to be.  I think the evidence is pretty mixed on our ability to go in and sort of micromanage various subsectors of these markets.  So I don’t see any particular reason to expand into hybrid ARMs or to sell put options on longer-term assets.  I just do not think that is going to help us very much.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with many points made by Governor Warsh and expresses support for the strategy laid out by the staff. The only disagreement expressed is regarding the GSE facility, which the speaker believes should have been rescinded.


Passage number 220.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It consists of a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 221.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, you’re going to hear some similarity to what you just heard from Governor Warsh and President Plosser.  I agree with most of the statements that were made.  I feel particularly strongly about the issue of the Treasuries.  As Governor Warsh mentioned, I’m beyond particularly uncomfortable, I am especially uncomfortable.  I think there’s no evidence that it has a positive impact.  We can tell ourselves and we can tell the marketplace that, indeed, the corporate debt market has improved.  I’m rather pleased with that; obviously, we all are. I’m not sure there’s direct causality, but I do think the risk-return tradeoff is way too negative. Even if we figure out a cute way to say it, there still is a suspicion that we’re monetizing deficits, although we’ve been much firmer in our public statements on that.  And I realize that in chart 4 that’s just a somewhat important factor, but it is a factor, and I worry about that.  I want to come back to Brian’s recommendations.  I think we have to be very careful that we’re not perceived as basically providing facilities to prop up institutions that are too big to fail at the expense of other institutions that desire to grow.  In my earlier remarks, I used the wrong term.  I said “political,” and I meant “optical”—I think the optics are rather poor.  If TAF is being used, as was pointed out in the staff paper, principally or significantly by two institutions that are too big to fail, I think we have to be careful about that.  President Plosser made a suggestion that we might limit it even more severely in terms of the amounts; I think he was suggesting a pricing impact there.  Obviously, classical central banking is to lend at a penalty rate. But that penalty rate is a gift compared to what we would be charging smaller and regional banks. Therefore, I would ask you to go through the list and think of which of these facilities are really in place to prop up institutions that are too big to fail.  And I would be curious as to which of those facilities you consider as actually having an impact there and as helpful on that front and which are not.  But I reiterate my concerns about the optics of TAF and the primary credit recommendations.   On the issue of exiting, obviously the market is asking for it.  Everybody’s asking for it. I do think the Monetary Policy Report, Mr. Chairman, is the appropriate vehicle, and, perhaps, your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Like President Plosser, I personally am uncomfortable with Fed bills.  I don’t think it is politically feasible. The staff points that out. I worry about the market that would be made in those and the derivatives that would be written from them.  I have spoken to that before, but I don’t think that is a particularly wise recommendation to make.I will make one last recommendation, only half in jest, which is that we get rid of the TALF program and we call that the Bill Nelson Relief Act.  [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the statements made by Governor Warsh and President Plosser and voices concerns and recommendations on various issues.


Passage number 222.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. If we got rid of it, it would be a relief for Bill Nelson, I’m sure. [Laughter] Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 223.
 MR. TARULLO. I’m now a little confused.  It sounds to me as though we’re now having the monetary policy discussion, and if that’s what we’re going to do, that’s fine.  I just want to know if that’s what we’re actually doing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo is simply expressing confusion and seeking clarification on the topic being discussed, specifically whether they are currently discussing monetary policy.


Passage number 224.
 MR. FISHER. I was just reacting to the three points that were raised.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply reacting to three points that were raised without expressing opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 225.
 MR. TARULLO. I think we’re now getting to the substance of what I thought was going to be tomorrow’s discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that they are moving on to the substance of what was expected to be discussed the next day.


Passage number 226.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I’ll leave it to people to do what they want.  I think the issues that we were discussing were the exit tools, the tactics for the Desk in dealing with large-scale asset purchases, and the winding down of the programs.  Those were the things that I asked people to talk about, so perhaps we could focus on those.  President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and requesting a focus on certain topics.


Passage number 227.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll try to be brief and confine my remarks to the three things that you asked about.  With respect to the credit and liquidity facilities and the timing of trimming them back, I thought that Brian and the staff put forward a very well thought out proposal, and it’s a proposal I completely support.  I think it is important to include language of the type that you read from the draft that you’re preparing.  I’ll say this again in the policy round, but I want to emphasize that we have to be very careful not to signal an early end to policy stimulus, and while I see a good reason to withdraw the facilities in the manner that you  set out, I think it’s very important to put in place language that leans against the idea that we’re looking for an early end to policy stimulus. So I support the proposal and the language you read. On exit strategies, I do think you indicated that you might discuss this in detail in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.  I think that’s absolutely the right place to do it, and I think it’s important to indicate that we have complete confidence in our ability to withdraw stimulus when we need to do so, that we have the tools to do it, and that when the time comes, which is not now or soon, that we will proceed to do it. The wording for monetary policy alternative B has been changed, but the phrasing in the original draft of B is the type of thing I think we have to be very careful to avoid.  It suggests that we’re not sure if we have the ability to exit and, therefore, we will carefully consider whether we should expand our balance sheet further.  I believe we do have the tools.  I thought the staff did a wonderful job of preparing the memo on exit strategies.  It convinced me that, if the only thing we had to work with was interest on reserves, it probably would be sufficient.  I thought this idea of strengthening it through collateralized accounts was really clever, was implementable, and was almost foolproof.  And I would love to see the staff do the further work that would be necessary to confirm that that is a foolproof technique, adding to the arsenal of tools, such as triparty reverse repos, and making sure that that is entirely workable.  To me, it seems that package, if we do nothing else, is sufficient for us to assert confidently that we can do what is needed when the time comes.  But that time is not now. On the LSAPs, they obviously do get into policy issues, and let me try to leave some of the policy issues around this until tomorrow.  Initially I was an enthusiast for long-term Treasury purchases. I thought the purpose of it was not only to improve liquidity and market functioning, but also to influence yields to push them down.  Now, I didn’t see it as a commitment to a   particular rate, which would be very dangerous; but, other things equal, and depending on our assessment of overall financial conditions and the outlook, I saw it as an attempt to push rates lower than they would otherwise be. On theoretical grounds, I believe there’s a very strong case that they should have some effect, but it has been awfully hard to identify exactly what that effect is, and I think that we’re beginning to run into costs of pursuing that further.  I think our reputation for independence is suffering, and the public is obviously concerned that we’re monetizing the debt and that it’s going to lead to an outbreak of inflation.  I have to say that I completely disagree with these views, but I can’t say they’re not prevalent.  I encounter them day in and day out. So at the present time, I would say the benefits don’t merit the costs, but I wouldn’t want to see Treasuries taken off the table if conditions were to deteriorate and attitudes were to change. I think our communications around this have really been a problem, and as I consider the concrete proposals the staff put forward in their memo, it seems to me that improving our communications is important.  The thing that most concerns me is the autumn expiration date for our long-term Treasury purchase program.  That’s coming up quickly.  We either have to decide now or we’ll have to decide in August. There will be a lot of market speculation.  In the meantime if we could do something at this meeting to clarify rather than keep the market guessing, I think it would be desirable. This brings me to the suggestion—which is a policy decision, but to my mind, in some sense, a relatively small one—to add a sentence that says something like “to align the end dates (or the timing) of the three asset purchase programs, we’ve extended the current pace of Treasury purchases through the end of the year, bringing the total size of the program to $450 billion.”  That would say they are all aligned at the end of the yearand that we’re going to decide what to do with these programs.  I would like to see us take that off the table. Quickly, on other issues, I could see some merit in flexibility in terms of the allocation of our purchases between MBS and Treasuries. We didn’t have a concrete proposal, but assuming that we’re not going to expand the overall level of our Treasury purchases, except perhaps extending the program at the current pace to the end of the year, then I agree that this isn’t the right time to go in that direction. The idea of leaning against the wind—I could see some merit in it, but it will be incredibly complicated to reach agreement and communicate to the Desk or to the outside world what we’re doing, and I wouldn’t go there now at all.  I’d just maintain steady as you go. I do think the idea of adding hybrid ARMs to the program is very constructive, given what’s happening in the housing market and given that mortgage rates have backed up so much, so if that’s a viable, practical possibility, I would move in that direction, too.

Passage number 229.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In thinking about the three issues you raised, I start from the presumption that we don’t need to convince market participants at this stage that we will do what it takes to, if possible, restore stability and to encourage financial and economic health. I think we need to convince them that we have an exit strategy and that we are prepared to execute it in a timely way. So against that background, with regard to the trimming and extending of the liquidity facilities, I’m generally fine with the proposal that Brian described and the language that you put forward. If it were my nickel, I might tighten up that language and make the commitment to endthe programs a little more forcefully, but the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony might be a better place to elaborate on that whole set of issues. With regard to the LSAP, those suggestions strike me as solutions in search of a problem. What I mean by that is that financial market conditions have been getting better.  Now, maybe interest rates have backed up, but there are a number of explanations for that, and it’s very difficult to sort through exactly which might be responsible.  If conditions hadn’t been improving, I might be interested in trying to fine-tune the LSAP, but because they have been improving, I don’t see any great value—in fact, I don’t see any value whatsoever—in going down that path, and I would avoid it. With regard to exiting and raising interest rates when the time comes, I guess I think there are a variety of tools that would enable us to address the situation.  They’ve been discussed. I am not terribly concerned about this. I don’t quite understand the issue about having committed ourselves to a permanently large balance sheet.  The size of the balance sheet is up to the Committee ultimately, and if we decide that we want to shrink it, then we simply give the directive to the Desk that it should be shrunk, and they will have to execute that.  So I don’t see that as a problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Stern, expresses his agreement with the proposals and suggestions discussed, but also offers some slight suggestions for improvement. Overall, he seems to be in agreement with the ideas being discussed.


Passage number 230.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "Thank you, President Hoenig" simply expresses gratitude towards President Hoenig.


Passage number 231.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would start with Brian’s description, and I’m generally supportive of this proposal.  It does give an end date, and I agree with President Stern—I think the firmer that end date is, of course, the better. On the TAF issue that President Fisher brought up, I think he has valid points, but I do think we need to look at that pretty carefully, and I know you are going to do some follow-up on that. And because we’re talking about exit strategies, and these liquidity facilities are part of it, it does extend to the LSAP.  From my perspective, the most unusual thing that we have is the LSAP, and I think that’s where we need to focus when we think about exit strategy.  I think at each meeting we should first make a decision about whether we even want to go to where we have said the “up to” figure is. It becomes very important that we make a rational choice around that, because the first step of exiting is not going any further.  I think that’s critical and takes time and effort.  I also think having the equivalent of GSE assets on our balance sheet with these MBS is questionable in terms of the role of the central bank, if we have, in fact, stabilized the markets.  And I am very uneasy about purchasing long-term Treasuries.  Perhaps it is optics, but I think in some sense it’s also reality—you are monetizing the debt.  So that’s how I think about our exit strategy across all the actions we’ve taken. In terms of the flexibility on how to administer this, I think we should not have flexibility. If we met the needs of the MBS that we put on, and now our additional purchases are causing other issues, then that’s a sign, perhaps, that we shouldn’t be going to the limit.  I think we should be aware of this and take note of it and not just say, “Well, we’ve got to get to the total. Let’s shift over to long-term Treasuries.”  There’s information in the feedback we are getting from the market that we ought to use and not ignore.  That’s how I look at your three questions, and less flexibility in the third is better than more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is generally supportive of the proposal and agrees with the idea of having a firm end date. The speaker raises some concerns and suggestions for further consideration, but there is no direct disagreement with the overall sentiment expressed.


Passage number 232.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 233.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll take the points in the sequence that you mentioned. On Brian’s and the staff’s facility recommendations, although I long for the day when we are comfortable with markets to the point of ending 13(3) authority, I’m not bothered by theindividual programs.  I think they’re well put together, and I think the plan, as stated, is a good one. Frankly, I think markets will see the conditional statements in the release as indicating our willingness to keep the 13(3) authority for a time.  I wouldn’t think that they would think we’re about to ramp it down, but we’ll see. And I do think that ending 13(3) will be done appropriately, it will be positive, it will be a boost, much like the SCAP. On the exit strategies and the reserve management tools, much as President Yellen indicated, I tend to favor the tools that strengthen the interest on excess reserves mechanism, and there are a number of those that, put together, should strengthen the arbitrage.  Reverse RPs, I think, are also a good tool. If we’re looking to the money market funds as one source of liquidity, that’s going to sort of alter the commercial paper market, since they’re a big source of funding there. And I just don’t know what the implications are.  We’d want to understand expected dysfunction in that market—as opposed to unexpected dysfunction—to see what we’d be doing there. But reverse RPs are quite good, I think. On the comment that we should try to project complete confidence in our ability to do this, mostly I agree with that.  My first reaction is that you’ve actually talked quite a lot about exit strategies already. And in your Q&A with the Congress, I’m not exactly sure how much of what you intend to say will be new.  Just your saying it is newsworthy of course.  [Laughter] But I’m not quite sure how that will play out.  I was very struck by the extreme scenario on net income which indicated that the balance sheet would be so large that we could find ourselves in a situation where we are challenged by it—challenged in an optics sense, not in our ability to create new reserves to pay and fund what we need to do.  As we’ve learned through the introduction of all of our facilities and in using our authorities, there is a risk to the institution at   some level that we should be mindful of.  I should add that I think it is being handled very well so far. Finally, on the large-scale asset purchases—and I’ll try to be true to not talking about policy on this. The Committee selected a number, for example, for Treasury purchases, of $300 billion, and I thought that it would be implemented to that number.  So if tapering effects are important for a given time frame, then I would have envisioned going at X dollars per month for a time, and then within the last one or two months tapering to half of that.  That allows the Committee to revisit it in a timely fashion to say, “Should we extend it.” as President Yellen suggested, or it could be tapered on to $300 billion.  But it would be a policy decision that the Committee makes.  I’ll leave it at that.  Thank you.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 235.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I agree with everyone else.  We absolutely need a framework that people can have confidence in for how we’re going to exit the current balance sheet and raise interest rates.  But as we’ll discuss tomorrow, I think it’s way too early to begin that exit, and I do worry about signaling an exit before the economy is really ready for it. But we do need to have the framework.  In that regard, I’m comfortable with the liquidity facilities proposals in Brian’s memo.  I think basically they recognize and validate what’s already happening in the market, and that’s fine.  And I was comfortable with the sentence you read, Mr. Chairman.  I think it was sufficiently conditional, and I wouldn’t strengthen it.  My concern is that, if we find ourselves in a position where we don’t want to wind down, we haven’t already told people we are going to wind down, but rather we have told people we are going to be looking at things.  I came in a little like President Fisher, looking for perhaps raising that TAF minimum bid rate, thinking that, unlike all the other facilities we have, that’s one that doesn’t quite wind down as automatically as markets improve.  My mind is still open on that.  I haven’t heard a lot of support for that, but I thought raising that would reinforce the winding down.  I appreciate Brian’s point that it’s an auction facility—they can always cut the amounts rather than raise the price; but raising the price would reinforce that.  So I guess, on balance, I would be slightly in favor of raising the TAF penalty rates. On exit tools, I was actually encouraged by the presentations by the staff—Spence, Trish, and others—which indicated that we do have a lot of tools.  And, like President Evans, I see these tools for sterilizing or reducing reserves working together with interest on reserves, and I feel more confident than before I read the memo that we can accomplish a lot.  I guess you’re going to have to work on these reverse RPs—who the counterparties are (including the GSEs) and whether you need to diversify past the dealers.  I’m not totally convinced you do need to; the dealers are there to be intermediaries, and they can play that role.  Anyhow, that would be a good thing. And the time deposits I thought also were a good thing. I wouldn’t rule out selling assets quite as much as some of you would.  We took these special actions to lower rates—I will come to that next—but if we’re in a situation where we are worried about inflation, we can undo them, although maybe not in huge size.  I would think selling some of the portfolios, depending on the circumstances, might not be a bad idea.  That brings me to the LSAPs.  My objectives were different from yours, Governor Warsh. I voted for this in order to lower interest rates, or at least to make interest rates lower than they otherwise would be. It was keyed to the macroeconomic outlook last March, which was pretty dire and getting worse all the time, and we had run out of fed funds ammunition in December.  So I was not uncomfortable. I was in favor of diversifying our portfolio of purchases into Treasuries. I think the monetizing problem is keyed to the fiscal deficit outlook.  If that weren’t so uncertain and looking so unsustainable, I don’t think people would be worried about us. But it is uncertain and looking unsustainable, so I think we need to be careful about the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy.  Therefore, I would not be in favor of increasing those purchases at this time. I came into the meeting thinking about some flexibility across instruments within the total amount and across time.  But I’ve been discouraged by the discussion at the meeting.  I think we can set a price or we can set a quantity, but setting the relationships of price and quantity in a clear way is just very, very hard. So I think I’d stick with what we are doing now. I would be okay with small purchases of hybrid ARMs.  I think it might encourage that market a little bit and help the mortgage market, which has been adversely affected by the uptick in Treasury rates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is some disagreement and differing opinions expressed by Mr. Kohn. He agrees with the need for a framework for exiting the current balance sheet and raising interest rates, but believes it is too early to begin that exit. He also expresses concerns about signaling an exit before the economy is ready for it. Additionally, he discusses his openness to the idea of raising the TAF penalty rates and his disagreement with increasing LSAP purchases at the time.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 237.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we have to be really careful about our communications in terms of discriminating between our ability to exit smoothly and implying that we’re about to exit.  I will probably come back to this point tomorrow.  The anxiety that I have about inadvertently implying to the market that we are exiting soon is particularly high now, because the market has already priced in a lot more tightening than most of us think is likely over the next year or two.  That said, of course, we have to be prepared for exit, and I think being prepared for exit and articulating that is really, really important in keeping inflation expectations well anchored, and also in keeping the dispersion of inflationexpectations compact.  So I think we definitely have to do that, but I think it’s tricky to do one without implying the other. In terms of Brian’s recommendations on the facilities, I’m pretty comfortable with all of it. I do want to make sure the language stays where it is, though, and doesn’t get more definitive about what happens in February.  I think February is a long time away, and I wouldn’t want to prejudge what we’re going to want to do or not want to do in February.  I think where we are right now in terms of the language is about right.  It basically says there’s a possibility that we might not extend it, so the market is put on notice.  But it doesn’t necessarily commit us to ending the facilities. On the TAF, I am on the other side of that issue from Don on the rate rise.  It’s not a big deal for me, but let me just explain why I am on the other side.  I think raising the rate on TAF will be seized upon by some as the beginning of raising interest rates.  So it’s not the TAF rate rise that bothers me per se.  I can certainly understand the argument for doing that in the small, but I’m a little worried that if we do it, people will say, “Oh, look, this is the very beginning of the rate hikes, because they have now raised the rate on the TAF.”  There’s also a second, more subtle issue on the TAF, if we are actually going to go to the sporadic TAF auctions over the longer term.  We probably can’t really do that in a normal environment with a penalty rate.  If you think of the transition on the TAF, we’d have to move to a penalty rate, and then later on, as we go to the sporadic auctions, we’d actually have to lower the rate again.  That just seems a little confusing to me.  But my main concern is the signal in terms of monetary policy that people might draw from raising the rate. On the LSAP, I don’t feel very defensive about what we’ve been doing.  After all, we did get a really good mortgage refinancing wave—that was the point of the exercise.  It’s hard toknow how much of it was MBS versus Treasuries, and we’ll never really know for certain.  But I feel pretty good about basically having achieved that objective. In terms of Treasuries, I don’t think there’s any appetite for going much larger.  I think the choice is really between standing pat and going to, as President Yellen said, $450 billion and extending it through year-end. The advantage of the latter is that you don’t have to make up your mind quite so soon, but the disadvantage is that it seems like a pretty weak response.  It shows a lack of sort of confidence in what the Fed is doing with this facility.  So I guess I’m slightly leaning toward standing pat, because I worry that the other option would be viewed as too little to be significant. I think the suggestion about hybrid ARMs makes a lot of sense.  In some ways, if we don’t do that, we’re basically distorting the relationship between the fixed-rate agency MBS and the hybrid ARMs, and it’s not really clear why we would want to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses concern about the possibility of inadvertently implying to the market that the Fed is about to exit soon, while also acknowledging the importance of being prepared for an exit.


Passage number 238.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any content or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 239.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you. On the question of extensions and modifications on liquidity facilities, I’m generally in favor of the proposal, but I wonder if one option might be to raise the minimum rate for TAF at the same time we increase the spread on the primary credit, so that we’d be treating the two different types of borrowers the same way. On the exit strategies, it strikes me that the whole discussion is incredibly similar to a normal exercise in asset-liability management that goes on in banks all the time and that we should probably be paying attention to the same kind of tools that are used in banks to simulate various possibilities. Regarding these tools, I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive, so some modeling of an optimum mix—a funding mix if you will—of all of the various tools, taking into account some of the different barriers that we might run into in different markets, might make some sense. Also, I’d be interested in some sort of regular reporting, whether it is in Notes or the Bluebook or one of the other books, so that we keep an eye on the potential costs of the exit strategies in a number of different environments.  As a banker, I have been in a situation where I have looked into the future and have seen losses that would arise from unwinding positions that I had taken. Of course, at that time, I was never able to adjust my cost of funds absolutely.  [Laughter] So it occurs to me this could involve an incredibly magnified political risk.  There’s a huge temptation not to take those losses when the risk associated with taking the losses is very high. So we need to make sure that we’re paying attention to those costs, particularly if they would bring us under political pressure at the same time that we’re doing something that’s politically unpopular to begin with.  So, again, I think modeling those out is important.   I guess the statement that struck me the most is that the banking organizations have not discussed with System staff the possible effects of increased Systemwide reserves.  I haven’t seen any indication that anybody anywhere in the banking industry has thought about the implications of these very high reserves in the system.  I’ve been trying to think what that effect might be, and, frankly, I don’t know.  But it strikes me that this level of reserves is going to have some sort of effect, so we should start to think about that, too.  Hopefully, some of our researchers can come up with some possible impacts. Finally, on flexibility, I’m probably, again, headed dangerously close to the policy round discussion. When we first started these programs, I wasn’t entirely sure how much we would need, so it strikes me that, if a given purchase amount is beginning to impair functioning in any market that we are in, we have to wonder if that purchase amount minus one is also doing anything positive in that market.  That would seem to indicate that certainly we’re getting close  to an exit for agency debt. And I wonder, as originations go down, whether we end up in the same place with the MBS.  Those are my comments, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of the speaker expressing their thoughts and suggestions on various topics.


Passage number 240.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 241.
 MR. ROSENGREN. I agree with Brian’s recommendations.  In terms of the TAF option of raising the minimum bid rate, I come out where Governor Kohn does.  There are several large institutions that are borrowing heavily from the TAF that are just holding them as excess reserves. I think having a 10 basis point charge and making it a little bit costly actually does make sense; it will probably bring down the TAF borrowing somewhat, which, given the size of our balance sheet, probably also makes sense. In terms of the tools for exit, I agree with virtually everything that President Yellen said, so I’m not going to repeat it.  In terms of the asset purchase strategy, we don’t need to buy $1¼ trillion just for market function and liquidity in mortgage-backed securities.  We weren’t trying to set interest rates, but we were certainly trying to influence interest rates.  There’s no reason to do something of that magnitude unless we’re going to influence interest rates.  So I do think that there’s still a little bit of difference around the table about exactly what we think these programs are intended to do.  But we made a distinction between quantitative easing and the asset side of the balance sheet.  To me, that meant that we’re trying to get the financing costs lower.  It’s hard to break this out from the discussion for tomorrow.  But if we’re not happy with where we are on our dual mandate, this is the only tool we have.  And the way it operates has to be through the cost of financing. So, it’s a topic for discussion for tomorrow, but I think we have to make that link.  We can’t talk about it separately.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker states that they agree with the recommendations and views of others, adding their own thoughts on the issue. They also mention that there may be some slight differences in perspectives around the table, but they do not elaborate on any specific disagreements.


Passage number 242.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thanks. President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "President Bullard" does not present any conflicting ideas or arguments.


Passage number 243.
   MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just have a few quick comments.  I agree with all the points in the Madigan memo.  I think it does recognize what is happening with our liquidity facilities. I have advocated before that we get them all priced as backstops and not that they actually need to be used at every point in time.  I would also announce a rescission date for GSE lending. Couldn’t we make that February 1, 2010, as well.  That would push it off into the future and would line it up with the other dates as opposed to doing it immediately.  I would go ahead and raise the minimum bid rate.  I don’t feel strongly on that.  I guess I come out where Governor Kohn and President Fisher have. My thinking on that was that we could encourage more-normal market functioning there.  Vice Chairman Dudley brings up a good point, namely, that it sounds like raising an interest rate.  I think that’s a communication issue, and that would have to be handled appropriately. On the issues related to exiting, my overall reading is that there are some very promising but unproven ideas here, mostly to do with interest on reserves and reverse repos.  We think they’ll work, but at this point they’re not really proven.  I guess I’m reluctant to go further with asset purchases without more concrete ideas on how we’ll manage this going forward, although I do admit that these are promising. The current policy response to the crisis has been to lower nominal interest rates to zero and more than double the monetary base.  I think this discussion indicates that that increase in the monetary base will be very persistent, which is unprecedented in post-war U.S. history.  I am worried that we don’t really know what the implications of that might be, and we don’t really have tools in place to manage that.  So we’re not really exiting from that increase in the base, we’re just saying: “That was our response. We’re going to more than double the monetary base, and we’re going to see what happens.”   On asset purchases strategy, I’d be fine with the tapering off.  I don’t feel really strongly on that. I think if we stick with our dates, the exit might go fine on the Treasuries. In the current environment of large fiscal deficits, as several people have mentioned, including Governor Kohn, there’s always going to be talk about monetizing the debt.  I just don’t think we can get away from it in this environment.  Anything we do that smacks of buying up more Treasuries is going to be problematic.  So even though I have advocated in the past for treating MBS and Treasuries and debt all as one package and letting the Desk manage it, now I think it may not be the best thing to do. I’m also sympathetic with President Rosengren, who spoke earlier this afternoon about a state-contingent reaction function.  I have advocated for this before here, and though I know we are a long way from that, that’s really what you want.  You want to be able to communicate to the public that if the data come in a little bit worse, then we’re going to do a little bit more, and if the data come in a little bit better, we’re going to do a little bit less.  That’s the kind of thing that you want. You have that in something like a Taylor Rule for interest rate policy.  You’d like that for asset purchases. We just haven’t been able to formulate something like that.  I’d like to encourage us to keep thinking in that direction.  After all, zero interest rates might go on for several years, so it’s not as if this situation is about to end.  So I think we should still keep thinking about that, but I know that we’re a long way from that at this point.  Thank you very much.

Passage number 245.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also support Brian’s recommendations on our credit and liquidity facilities.  In regards to tools for exiting, I am also very appreciative to the staff for the excellent work that they did.  I am now more confident that we have the tools.  I  am also very much in favor of using the Monetary Policy Report to describe the tools that are available to us. And I prefer focusing on those tools that we currently have available to us that don’t require any legislation or other changes. I also agree with Governor Kohn’s comments that it’s too soon to consider a change in policy, but I also agree that it’s not too soon for the Committee to start talking about a framework—or the process that we’re going to be using—to decide how we are going to apply these tools. In addition, I think it would be helpful for the staff and this Committee to start looking at some alternative language for use in statements that will describe this environment that we are going to be in, where we are simultaneously adjusting our fed funds target and managing the size of our balance sheet. As President Yellen stated, I think that getting prepared to communicate is just as important as getting ready to use the tools.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 249.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I thank you. Just very quickly, let me summarize a few things. I think there was a lot of support for Brian’s recommendations.  The only issue I heard was some discussion about raising the bid rate on the TAF.  You can raise the rate by cutting the quantity or by raising the rate. I think the optics are a little bit risky to be raising the rate.  I would be inclined to go with the recommendation that the staff has put forward. On the exit strategy, I guess I disagree with President Lacker.  I think it’s important for us to have these other tools to diversify our ability to sterilize reserves.  A number of things are very interesting—reverse repos, collateralized lending, term deposits.  And we didn’t talk about redemptions, but redemptions actually are part of this, too.  That’s going to be significant over the next couple of years. I think most people agree that it would be very valuable to have as detailed as possible a discussion of the exit strategy in the Monetary Policy Report.  And I think there was good support for that, and we should proceed with that. Finally, on the Desk and flexibility, there didn’t seem to be much interest in giving you a great deal of flexibility.  [Laughter]  But I want to make a couple of points.  One is, clearly, we don’t want purchases to be counterproductive, so if you are overwhelming the market, or something like that, you should either adjust or let the Committee know about it.  I think there was also a good bit of interest in your promoting liquidity and, in that respect, considering off-the-run securities, things of that sort. But I personally also would support lending securities.  I think that just adds to the liquidity in the market.  We’ll talk more tomorrow about asset purchases as a strategy, and so on. Let me just say to President Plosser and President Lacker, that we should close the GSE lending authority. It turned out to be an inconvenient moment, but we will do that as soon as we can find an appropriate time.  Anything else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is mostly summarizing and expressing their personal opinions on various topics.


Passage number 250.
 MR. TARULLO. Mr. Chairman, I think we should say for the record that Brian should draw no negative inferences from the fact that at his very first meeting President Lacker suggests that we should withdraw discretion from the Desk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 251.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let that be noted. This is the latest we’ve ever ratified the open market operations, I’m sure, in the history of the Federal Reserve.  If there are no other comments, we need to take a few votes. First, by the FOMC to ratify domestic open market operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about the timing of a ratification process.


Passage number 252.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not contain any statement or indication of disagreement or conflict. It appears to be a simple directive or instruction to "move."


Passage number 253.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any objections. [No response]  Thank you. Next, by the FOMC to modify the authorization to allow the lending of agency debt.  Are there those who  would like to be recorded in opposition to that.  No.  Without objection.  Thank you. The remaining votes are on the program extensions or modifications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker asks if there are objections, and when there is no response, they proceed with the next topic. They then ask if anyone is opposed to a particular action, and again there is no objection. The passage ends with a statement about the remaining votes, but there is no indication of disagreement.


Passage number 254.
   MR. MADIGAN. Mr. Chairman, could I recommend one change to the recommended resolutions.  The draft that was circulated indicated that the New York Fed is directed “to suspend operations of” the TSLF options program.  I recommend substituting “to suspend auctions under” the TSLF options program.  The reason for the change is that there are options outstanding, and I don’t think the intent would be to prevent those options from being exercised.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Madigan is suggesting a slight change to the wording of a resolution, but there is no opposing view expressed.


Passage number 255.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Noted. Thank you. We need a motion to extend the swap agreements.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges the previous statement and requests a motion to extend the swap agreements.


Passage number 256.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any clear indication of any contention or disagreement. Without any contrasting viewpoints or conflicting statements, it is not possible to identify any contention in the given passage.


Passage number 257.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Is there anyone who objects.  [No response] Okay. The FOMC needs to extend the TSLF until February 1, understanding that the schedule 1 auctions will be suspended and the schedule 2 auctions reduced in size and that the options program will be suspended along the lines that Brian mentioned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is phrased as a question, but there is no response indicating objection or disagreement. The subsequent statements simply explain the course of action that needs to be taken.


Passage number 258.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement between parties. Mr. Kohn simply states "So move," which suggests agreement or approval.


Passage number 259.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any objection, concerns.  Seeing none, okay. For the Board, we are asked to extend the AMLF, the commercial paper funding facility, the primary dealer credit facility, and the TSLF.  This includes the additional restrictions on the AMLF, which Boston will take care of, the reduced offerings under the TSLF, and the tightening of collateral conditions for the primary dealer credit facility.  And we will not extend the MMIFF, the money market facility.  Brian.  6 The materials used by Messrs. Kiley and Sheets are appended to this transcript (appendix 6).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the decisions and actions that need to be taken without any objection or concerns being raised.


Passage number 260.
MR. MADIGAN. Just one additional point. On the tightening of the collateral restrictions, it’s likely that that will not be implemented immediately but some time in the next several months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that the tightening of collateral restrictions will not be implemented immediately but "some time in the next several months." This statement does not indicate any disagreement or contention; it simply provides information about the timeline for implementation.


Passage number 261.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. That will be clear in the statement tomorrow.  Yes, okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is agreement indicated by the use of the word "okay" in both sentences. The second sentence suggests that the statement to be made tomorrow will provide clarity, indicating shared understanding.


Passage number 262.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement of someone's words, with no conflicting viewpoints presented.


Passage number 263.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any objection from the Board.  Seeing none. Finally, from the Board, the resolution to scale back the TAF according to the schedule that Brian suggested.  Seeing no objection. Thank you very much.  Again, we’ll provide you with a press release as soon as possible, and it will go out on Thursday, at noon, I believe. Let us go on now to the staff presentation on the economy.  Michael Kiley and Nathan Sheets will make the presentation.  Whenever you are ready.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage indicates agreement and lack of objection among the Board members.


Passage number 264.
 MR. MADIGAN.7  I will be referring to the separate package labeled “Material for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections.”   Exhibit 1 tabulates the central tendencies and ranges of your latest projections.  Corresponding information about your April projections is indicated in italics, and June Greenbook projections are included as memo items.   As shown in the upper left portion of the table, your forecasts for real GDP growth in 2009 have a central tendency of -1.5 to -1 percent.  That is an upward shift of about ¼ to ½ percentage point from April, reflecting increases to your projections for both halves of this year. You indicated that the upward revision was in response to the better tone of the data releases and improvements in financial conditions over the intermeeting period.  Your growth forecasts for 2010 and 2011 are similar to those you provided in April.   Even though you project higher real GDP growth over the near term, all of you raised your forecasts of the unemployment rate.  The central tendency in the fourth quarter of 2009 is now 9.8 to 10.1 percent, about ½ percentage point above your April projections. You still expect that the unemployment rate will trend down during 2010 and 2011, but the levels remain about ½ percentage point above your April projections. Many of you cited recent higher-than-expected unemployment data as the reason for the revisions. Moreover, each of you indicated that the unemployment  rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 is likely to be well above your estimate of the long-run equilibrium unemployment rate.   As shown in the lower half of the table, recent information has led you to raise your forecasts for headline and core inflation from those in April.  The central tendency of your projections for headline PCE inflation in 2009 is 1.0 to 1.4 percent, about ½ percentage point above that of April, and you made small upward revisions in 2010 and 2011. Many of you noted that these upward revisions reflect the influence of higher-than-expected core inflation data and higher energy prices, and some pointed to higher inflation expectations.  Most of you still project that inflation will stay around or below your view of “mandate-consistent” inflation through 2011, but your expectations for inflation continue to span a wide range.  Some see inflation slowing through 2011 in response to persistently high economic slack, while others see inflation rising above “mandate-consistent” inflation because of the influence of the rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet on inflation expectations.   Over the near term, your views on the outlook are broadly similar to those of the staff. Greenbook projections for real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation forare within the central tendencies of your projections.  However, by 2011  noticeable differences are evident.  The Greenbook’s real GDP growth forecast for  that year is above the central tendency of your projections, while the staff forecasts  for the unemployment rate and core inflation are below the central tendencies.   Several of you again noted explicitly that you do not share the staff’s view of  inflation dynamics.  That divergence in views helps explain why more than half of you anticipate that  it will be necessary to begin moving the fed funds rate up appreciably earlier than  envisioned by the Greenbook, which assumes that the federal funds rate will remain  close to the zero bound through 2011.  As shown by the left panels of exhibit 2, your views on the degree of uncertainty surrounding your projections have not changed appreciably since April.  Almost all of you see greater-than-usual uncertainty regarding your projections of both economic growth and inflation, reflecting the unusual nature of the shocks that triggered the current recession and our limited experience with nontraditional policy tools.  However, as shown in the right-hand panels, more of you now judge that the risks to growth and inflation are roughly balanced.  For economic growth, many of you see the recent economic and financial developments as having reduced downside risks.  Fewer of you now judge that inflation risks are skewed to the downside, and a large majority of you see inflation risks as balanced overall. Mr. Chairman, that concludes our presentation.  But while I have the floor, could I note that I misspoke earlier when I said that the timing of the PDCF haircuts would be announced in the press release on Thursday. Those haircuts aren’t published, so it wouldn’t make sense to put them in the press release.  But the Desk will inform the dealers at the appropriate time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear disagreements or contentions. It is a presentation of information and forecasts.


Passage number 265.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation.  Questions for our colleagues.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude for the presentation and then requesting questions from colleagues.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 266.
  MR. FISHER. I just have some questions of Nathan.  You mentioned the Baltic Dry Index in the context of Chinese iron ore imports.  Chinese iron ore imports are far exceeding steel production, as you know. So my question is:  How sustainable, in your opinion, is this recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Fisher, questions the sustainability of the recovery mentioned by Nathan regarding Chinese iron ore imports.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 267.
  MR. SHEETS. We have reason to believe that these Chinese purchases are playing a very special role here. What is China doing with all of these commodities that they’re purchasing. I think the answer has three parts.  First, some of these commodities are actually  being consumed by Chinese firms in association with the fiscal stimulus that’s being put in place.  Second, some are being used to replenish inventory levels.  In the fall, when the Chinese and global economy hit something of a wall, many firms just backed away entirely from commodity purchases, and that is one of the reasons why the bottom fell out of the commodity market.  So those inventory levels are low, and they’re being brought back to normal levels.  Third, I think that there is some strategic purchasing going on in the Chinese economy right now.  Commodities are cheap, and they’re pretty confident that at some point they’re going to need to use them, so they’re buying things and stockpiling them. My sense is that, of those three causes, the first one is indicative of early stages of a recovery in the Chinese economy.  I think that’s probably sustainable.  These inventory-based explanations are less sustainable, so it wouldn’t surprise me if, over time, Chinese purchases flattened out, or even came back from where they are today.  Now, if that happens in the context of a broader global recovery, less demand for basic materials from China would be offset by increased demand from other countries.  But I think there is a risk that the commodity markets have gotten ahead of themselves and that the Chinese will stop buying at this furious pace, and we’ll see a little bit of unwinding of the increases in commodity prices that we’ve seen over the last few months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the first cause of Chinese purchases, the consumption by Chinese firms for fiscal stimulus, is indicative of an early stage recovery in the Chinese economy and is sustainable. However, they state that the inventory-based explanations are less sustainable and anticipate that Chinese purchases may flatten out or decrease. This suggests a difference in opinion regarding the sustainability of Chinese purchases and their impact on the commodity market.


Passage number 268.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude towards President Lockhart.


Passage number 269.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The PCE energy prices seem to be coming off in the forecast into 2010, while the oil commodity price continues to rise slightly, suggesting it’s non-oil energy. Can you explain what the thinking is there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for an explanation or clarification about the difference in forecasts for PCE energy prices and oil commodity prices.


Passage number 270.
 MR. KILEY. I think that’s mainly just looking at rates of changes versus levels.  It’s true that the level in 2010 is picking up, but the rate of change is decelerating, because we’ve seen a big run-up right now in oil prices, and that will be passed through over the second half of this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the difference between rates of changes and levels in relation to oil prices.


Passage number 271.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage as the passage is not provided.


Passage number 272.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I just wanted to ask you a question.  Taking note of the extremely large range on the inflation forecast for core PCE, is this outside of historical experience. I don’t mean the history of our projections—we haven’t been doing it that long. But have we seen this kind of range among professional forecasters, even taking note of the fact that they might want to market their forecasts in a particular way because they’ve got different jobs than we do.  It seems very large, and, frankly, it challenges your ability to listen to all of the commentary around the room in an even-keeled way, it seems to me.  Well, that’s my reaction—speaking of shipping.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans is simply asking a question and expressing his concerns about the large range on the inflation forecast.


Passage number 273.
 [Laughter] MR. MADIGAN. I don’t know the answer to your question, President Evans, but it is, as I noted in my remarks, fairly striking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply indicates that the speaker does not know the answer to a question, but finds it interesting or notable.


Passage number 274.
 MR. STOCKTON.  Just relative to the Greenbook stochastic simulations or the confidence intervals, even that wide range in 2011 is within the 70 percent confidence interval of the forecast.  So it’s a sad statement on forecasting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage states a fact about the Greenbook stochastic simulations and their confidence intervals. The speaker does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 275.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. FOMC are not sheep.  [Laughter] President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 276.
 MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question. I appreciate the discussion about measures of slack and output gaps, and I was particularly struck by the measures that were produced by the EDO model.  In the Bluebook, your description of the construction of the output gap is not the way I normally think of it—it looks like some long-run trend or steady-state model.  Most of these stochastic, general equilibrium models think about equilibrium output being at a point in time, and then you get shocked away from that.  The   difference between what might be produced by a sticky price model versus a flexible price model gives you some measure of the difference between what’s feasible and what you actually get.  But you’ve defined the output gap in a much different way, using what looks like some concept of steady state, and I was a little puzzled by that choice.  Of course, in your discussion you highlighted the fact that that actually led to the EDO model having a very large output gap rather than a somewhat smaller one.  Most of these DSGE models lead to much more volatile measures of what you might think of as equilibrium or potential output at a point in time.  If you sort of rethink, then, the range of where potential output might be in terms of what different models give you, I guess I wouldn’t have selected that subset, I would have selected a little different subset.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, expresses disagreement or contention with the way the output gap is defined in the Bluebook and suggests a different approach. He also questions the choice of models used to determine potential output.


Passage number 277.
 MR. KILEY. Right. A lot of that is jargon, terminology.  We were trying to create some definitions that could be consistently applied across many models.  So certainly in our model there’s a natural rate of output or an equilibrium rate of output that would be consistent with economic efficiency according to that model or with the absence of wage and price rigidities according to that model.  Those two wouldn’t necessarily be the same.  But one could have many different definitions of the natural rate of output or the equilibrium rate of output.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the concept of the natural rate of output or equilibrium rate of output and acknowledging that different definitions can exist.


Passage number 278.
 MR. PLOSSER. Right. It depends on your model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply stating that the outcome depends on the model being used.


Passage number 279.
 MR. KILEY. We’ve published papers on using that model and constructing those measures.  Those measures depend upon a set of assumptions regarding certain elements in the structure of the economy that many models don’t even make assumptions about.  So we couldn’t compare that concept with a time-series model, like the trend-cycle decomposition of GDP.  Nor could we compare that necessarily with the staff’s estimate; in putting together potential output, the staff takes a long-run growth accounting view and doesn’t think about what would happen if, for example, it removed all price and wage rigidities for the economy. We wanted to place all of our models on an equal footing, so we took a very standard definition of potential output for this exercise for the EDO model—the Beveridge–Nelson definition. The model has a representation of the economy that has stochastic trends and unit roots and all of these things in it, and we can crank through all of that machinery and generate a long-run forecast for output, just as you could in a time-series model, or in the FRB/US model, or in basically any model.  We considered that to be a really good thing, because we can actually use the same idea across models—we’re not mixing apples and oranges. When we do that in this model, there’s a lot of slack right now.  Other models of a similar type could give you a different answer—it could be that the natural rate of output gives you a very different answer. So you have to think about why you want to look at all of these concepts, and think about what you’re comparing across different models.  This seemed like the simplest way to compare across models. In response to a different question, you might want to use a different concept.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the methodology and rationale behind using the Beveridge-Nelson definition of potential output for the EDO model.


Passage number 280.
 MR. PLOSSER. I guess I don’t disagree with anything you’ve just said, except that I think it’s important to note that the concept of potential output is not model-free.  Therefore, we have to think hard about what this construct looks like.  At some level, you’re making some assumptions about what that concept means, and that concept can differ quite a bit across models that one might choose from.  That’s what makes all of this hard in sort of figuring out what the interpretation might be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear disagreement or contention. Mr. Plosser does not express disagreement with anything that has been said, but rather adds additional perspective and considerations to the discussion.


Passage number 281.
 MR. KILEY. That’s absolutely right, and I just want to clarify one thing.  The definition of “potential” here is a statistical definition that’s consistent with the model.  We didn’t say, “Okay, we’re going to use this statistical method for the output gap,” and then put it in the model, and a bunch of Phillips curves, or a bunch of other things.  The model is completelyindependent of that statistical machinery, and wages and prices and everything are being driven by all of the things that are appropriate in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model.  It’s trying to match the data, so when you generate a statistical measure of the output gap from this model, that statistical measure will forecast low inflation, because statistically that’s what it thinks happens in the data. That theoretical concept plays no role in the model—it’s a statistical concept.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply clarifying the definition of "potential" and explaining that it is a statistical concept in the model.


Passage number 282.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage only states "President Lacker" without providing any context or information regarding any potential contention or disagreement.


Passage number 283.
 MR. LACKER. The version of the output gap that President Plosser was referring to, as opposed to this other statistical one—that’s the one that governs inflation dynamics in that model, isn’t it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and asking for confirmation about a specific version of the output gap.


Passage number 284.
 MR. KILEY. No. In a simple three-equation model that’s true.  But once you have sticky prices and sticky wages, monopoly power, other sources of distorting shocks, there is no simple relationship between what would happen in the absence of wage and price rigidities and what would happen to inflation. You could write down a model—a very simple model—where that would be true. But it need not be the case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is explaining that in a simple three-equation model, there is a direct relationship between wage and price rigidities and inflation. However, in more complex models with factors like sticky prices, sticky wages, monopoly power, and other distorting shocks, the relationship becomes more complicated and there is no simple relationship between them. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement; it is simply providing an explanation.


Passage number 285.
  MR. LACKER. But that one is related, somehow, in a complicated way, and the one you display is not, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and clarification about two different topics.


Passage number 286.
 MR. KILEY. We forecast inflation with the model I’ve displayed.  It forecasts very low inflation, because the output gap is so big. That’s not a behavioral relationship, that’s a statistical regularity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Kiley, explains that the model forecasts low inflation due to a large output gap, and clarifies that this is a statistical regularity rather than a behavioral relationship. There is no indication of disagreement or opposing viewpoints in the passage.


Passage number 287.
 MR. LACKER. Well, wait.  I thought you said the model stood apart.  What does this gap measured from EDO have to do with inflation dynamics in the model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is seeking clarification and asking for further explanation regarding the relationship between the gap measured from EDO and inflation dynamics in the model.


Passage number 288.
   MR. KILEY. In the model, it doesn’t.  But the model is trying to capture the data.  You can simulate the model a million times, generate data, and then regress anything against anything and you find reduced-form relationships. The reduced-form relationships, consistent with the model and the data, are that output gaps predict low inflation.  And that’s a reduced-form characteristic of the model that comes from its structure.  It’s a pretty big and complicated model, as many are these days. But, because it tries to capture the data, and because it looks like that’s a regularity in the data, it’s generating that prediction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 289.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions. [No response]  All right. Thank you for a very productive discussion. Dinner tonight is purely social at the British Embassy at 7:30.  We’ll begin tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. with the go-round. [Meeting recessed]  8 The materials used by Mr. Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 8).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 290.
 June 24, 2009—Morning Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good morning, everybody.  I think we have a report on some data from Dave Stockton.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that there is a report on some data from Dave Stockton.


Passage number 291.
 MR. STOCKTON.8  Yes. First, Mr. Chairman, I think yesterday I broke my own record.  I said one thing at the meeting, and it was wrong.  [Laughter] I would like to correct that. In response to President Evans’s observation about the wide dispersion of the inflation forecast in 2011, I think I said that the range of those forecasts was within the 70 percent confidence interval that we generate using stochastic stimulations.  That, in fact, isn’t right.  The range for total PCE prices is just outside the 70 percent confidence interval, and the range for core PCE prices is even further outside the 70 percent confidence interval and, in fact, reaches the 90 percent confidence interval. So there is an unusually wide range of forecasts out there. As for the data, we received the advanced durables this morning—I think you should have the table in front of you—and it was a stronger-than-expected report.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—the bolded figures—rose 0.3 percent in May; we had actually been expecting shipments to decline about 1½ percent.  And orders rose more strongly, 4.8 percent, which is a pretty solid increase, pointing to a little bit less weakness going forward in capital spending than we’d been expecting.  Now, it is still the case that orders remain well below shipments and that overall equipment spending is still contracting, but I think we’d view these data as at least being supportive of our view that the pace of that contraction in equipment spending is lessening.  We’re going to get new home sales data later this morning.  We don’t have those yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply correcting a mistake they made in a previous statement and then presenting some data and their interpretation of it.


Passage number 292.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. We’ll begin our economic go-round with President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and stating that they will start a discussion about economic matters with President Plosser.


Passage number 293.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named President Lockhart.


Passage number 294.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to add my thanks to those of President Evans for the improved amplification.  I could hear President Plosser here very well.  [Laughter] In the last two weeks, because of the possible gap between reports of increasingly optimistic sentiment and underlying reality, the Atlanta Bank took great care to collect a lot of input from directors’ business and financial contacts.  Reports from the business community clearly indicate greater stability. That said, the tone of these reports suggests an economy that is still exceptionally fragile. There is not much optimism among my contacts for a strong recovery.  Business capital spending is being indefinitely postponed, and there is little appetite for hiring, even for seasonal or temporary positions. One Atlanta director, a partner in a top management consulting firm, stated that they are doing very little growth work and that most of their large corporate strategy assignments relate to positioning for subdued business conditions for the next five years. In the financial sector, banks are still very cautious in credit extension.  C&I loan demand remains quite soft, and mortgage demand fell sharply when mortgage rates rose above 5 percent. The outlook I submitted is little changed from late April.  I expect this will be an exceptionally slow recovery. I find the alternative simulations presented in this meeting’s Greenbook to be quite pertinent. My outlook has elements of the scenarios for both the slower recovery and labor market damage.  In my view, a slow restoration of financial markets will limit credit availability well into 2010, and the rebuilding of wealth is likely to be spread over several years. These influences will inhibit the usual forces of recovery.  The significant reorganization of the economy could keep the unemployment rate elevated for years into the recovery. As regards prices, the recent rise in oil and some other commodity prices could raise inflation statistics this summer, but we’ve also seen downward price pressure elsewhere in the data. Overall, I’m in the camp that is not overly concerned about inflation for the medium term.  I continue to think the prospect for deflation is roughly balanced against the likelihood that inflation will accelerate above a rate consistent with price stability.  But even if I am somewhat sanguine about inflation, I acknowledge a high level of uncertainty about the inflation outlook.  I also note that concern about inflation expressed anecdotally on the part of my business contacts is clearly rising; this concern seems to be connected to apprehension about how the Fed will manage its balance sheet going forward.  As I see it, the context of our policy discussion involves the potential of a widening separation in public and market sentiment between the expectation of policy reversal and exit and a more uncertain and fragile underlying reality.  I am   concerned that too much talk of exit could get ahead of reality.  As several said yesterday, this presents a particularly delicate communication challenge coming out of this meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 296.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The reports from my District have revealed lingering concerns about how the economy will evolve over the rest of this year.  Most of my contacts agree that their worst fears for the economy seem less likely to be realized now, but they are still far from optimistic.  Expectations for the remainder of the year varied from further reduction in activity levels to a very moderate resumption in economic growth.  Reports of hiring are still rare, and several contacts from larger companies suggest that they are working on another round of layoffs. From my District vantage point, it still looks like a very gradual recovery process. The inflation picture is mixed.  I am hearing a growing number of contacts expressing fears of inflation driven by rising commodity prices and ballooning fiscal deficits, but I am also hearing widespread reports of downward pressures on wages and benefits.  Synthesizing these reports and the incoming data into an outlook continues to be challenging.  I have revised up slightly my output forecast from the April meeting, as business fixed investment, although still a considerable drag on growth, declines less steeply than in my previous outlook. While business spending on equipment is likely to pick up in the second half of the year, spending on structures, as was mentioned yesterday, will probably take longer to recover. Some recent favorable readings from the housing indicators have also attenuated the near-term decline in residential investment in my outlook and have raised the prospect for a turnaround in housing in the second half of the year.  My forecast still has the unemployment rate peaking at just over 10 percent in early 2010.  The continued rapid rise in unemploymentcertainly remains an important drag on the economy as new jobs are hard to find for many of the workers who were laid off. I revised up my inflation forecast for 2009, but I left my longer-term inflation projection on a gradual path towards 2 percent. As we discussed yesterday, the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters has a broader variance around the longer-term inflation trend, but the median inflation projection is largely unchanged.  And, as we said yesterday, we have seen an unusually wide range of inflation projections in this round of the Committee’s submissions. We know that the liquidity problems in the TIPS market have made that a more difficult indicator to use to deem where inflation expectations are.  We have done some work at the Cleveland Fed using a different method of looking at the TIPS data, and those results suggest that inflation expectations have returned to pre-crisis levels.  Apparently, these results have been confirmed by the staff of the San Francisco Fed, who used a different methodology but came to the same conclusion.  Consequently, although inflation expectations are still volatile, I do think that it is reasonable to characterize them as anchored. In my view, the risks to the forecast remain to the downside for output, because the improvements in the real economy that we are seeing remain nascent and, I think, fragile.  However, I did revise my views of the risks around the inflation forecast to “balanced”—they are large but symmetric. This remains a very challenging period to evaluate the incoming data, and even a smaller gap doesn’t mitigate the fact that the economy is still contracting in the current quarter, and most projections show limited growth for a considerable period.  Despite my forecast for higher inflation compared with the Greenbook, my overall outlook leaves the economy a fair distance from needing a tighter monetary policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions concerns about the economy and varying expectations for the remainder of the year. They also mention both fears of inflation and downward pressures on wages and benefits. Additionally, the speaker mentions revising their forecast for output and inflation, showing disagreement with previous projections.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 299.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed forecast now expects that we will reach an unemployment rate of 10 percent.  Unfortunately, this statistic probably understates the degree of weakness in labor markets.  In discussion with small and medium-sized businesses in New England, it is striking how many firms have placed workers on part-time schedules and how many firms have reported reducing nominal wages to avoid further job cuts. If New England’s firms are representative of the wider economy, these practices may have implications for the recovery.  First, firms are likely to defer hiring not only until they are confident that the recovery has firmly taken root, but also until they have restored hours to those workers whose hours they have already reduced.  Second, wage pressures on inflation are likely to continue to be subdued, as firms in weak sectors of the economy defer wage increases until demand for their products increases. In my forecast, the recovery is quite restrained, making it unlikely that we reach full employment during the forecast horizon.  The recovery will be slower if mortgage rates do not encourage buyers back into the market.  While the 30-year mortgage rates have come down somewhat from the recent spike, they remain well above the rates earlier this spring.  Not   surprisingly, loan applications have slowed, and Realtors report diminished foot traffic after the rates increased.  But higher rates may slow the recovery even further.  Higher rates will likely put downward pressure on housing prices.  This, in turn, will further diminish household wealth, reducing consumption as households seek to recover from already large wealth losses.  In addition, lower house prices will likely add to the many households who struggle with the potential of home foreclosure.  As I discussed briefly yesterday, an interesting aspect of the mortgage market during this recession is that five- and seven-year ARMs are not priced as attractively as they were earlier in this decade.  If longer-term mortgage rates remain high, improved pricing of longer-term ARMs does have the potential to bring some borrowers back into the market. While financial markets have improved, they remain fragile.  The municipal bond market could still be roiled by the lack of political will by some states and municipalities to address their financial problems.  Bank lending could be affected if commercial real estate and consumer loans continue to deteriorate, forcing higher loan loss reserves, which, for many banks, are still moving slowly relative to the growth of nonperforming loans.  While the securitization market appears to have improved somewhat as a result of the TALF, it is unclear how the eventual removal of TALF financing and the possible legislation on securitization are likely to affect the recovery in this market. Overall, my forecast is not much different from the last FOMC meeting, and, frankly, that forecast implies uncomfortable outcomes for both unemployment and inflation.  Higher mortgage rates have caused me to push out the housing recovery, and the recent labor report has raised my path of unemployment.  Many banks remain capital constrained, and I expect many more to be constrained as they need to increase loan loss reserves.  Thus, I place a low   probability on rapid expansion of bank lending over the next two years.  Even by the end of 2011, I expect that the unemployment rate will be well above full employment and inflation will be well below my target.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, expresses concern about the current state of the labor market and the potential negative impacts on the recovery, such as deferred hiring and subdued wage increases. He also mentions the negative effects of higher mortgage rates on the housing market and household wealth. Additionally, he expresses doubts about the improvement in financial markets and the potential risks in the municipal bond market and bank lending. Overall, Mr. Rosengren's outlook implies uncomfortable outcomes for unemployment and inflation.


Passage number 300.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Bullard.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 301.
 MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the Eighth Federal Reserve District, the decline in economic activity is slowing or stopped.  Still, there are no immediate signs of improvement during the summer or fall.  Business contacts are definitely subdued.  I might even describe them as resigned to sluggish economic performance for the foreseeable future.  In recent calls that I made, there were some reports of slower activity in the second half of May and into June, so we’ll see if that shows up in the numbers going forward.  That worried me a little bit. On the national scene, my sense is that markets may have jumped ahead of the reality of the economy during the last 60 or 90 days.  That said, I am hoping for some improvement in the second half, but I think there’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty about where the economy will be going forward.  I think we’re vulnerable to further shocks.  Shocks are unpredictable, so I don’t know where they would come from.  But when you’re down, other things can happen.  I also think that the longer that the recession drags on, the greater the likelihood that new problems can arise that would not have been problems if the economy had turned around sooner.  And I just wanted to say I remain concerned about the global nature of this recession, which I think is largely unprecedented in the postwar era.   I’ve been concerned about possible deflation and a deflationary trap, that is, a steady state that we could actually get stuck in. If we were to enter such a trap in 2009 or 2010, we would have a very hard time getting out.  The first priority for me has been to avoid this outcome, and that means building up inflation expectations.  I think the probability that this will happen has  fallen some.  For instance, the five-year TIPS inflation compensation has increased—it’s about 125 basis points now. I know there’s a lot of analysis about exactly how to look at that.  If you just take it at face value, it has improved a lot from very negative values in December and January, but it’s still not a lot of inflation over the next five years.  It’s below our inflation target, and you’d like to see it higher, I think.  Also, the Greenbook forecast has inflation declining further, so I don’t think we’re out of the woods on the deflation threat, although the outlook has improved a lot from what it was in the December-January time frame. I think we’re entering a period of volatile expectations in markets.  The markets are just not sure what to think about the unprecedented policy environment.  They’re looking at numbers that they have not seen before, and they’re not sure what to think—large budget deficits where the longer-term outlook is very unclear.  Given that, I think our purchase program looks like— and I put that in quotes: “looks like”—debt monetization.  I don’t think anybody involved wants to go there, but that’s the appearance. And you’ve got legislation pending that may appear to threaten Fed independence.  I think the hard thing about our debt markets is that they’re global markets, so especially for those outside the U.S. who may not understand the subtleties of our politics, this just looks like a lot of debt issuance by the Treasury and some purchases by the central bank.  It’s just very hard to get away from that perception, and that has made me pessimistic about further expansion of our large-scale asset purchases. I think current policies are pushing very hard on our credibility.  As I mentioned before, I don’t think we could get away with these policies if we were a smaller developing country.  Fortunately, we do have a large stock of credibility to draw upon, but we need to be careful.  Just because everything has gone well for a long time in the U.S. doesn’t mean it will continue to do   so this time around.  Again, the policy response to this crisis has been unprecedented, so the current situation may not produce the outcomes that we hope for. I’m also concerned, along with President Plosser and others, about the emphasis in the narrative on a large output gap keeping inflation at bay into the indefinite future.  I don’t think inflation is a near-term problem, but it could be a medium-term problem.  I also think there are conceptual difficulties with the traditional output gap measures.  The empirical relationships are not that great. So the moment is really ripe for a possible policy mistake along this dimension, since we’re coupling that with our unprecedented policy action.  I think that’s going to remain an issue for the FOMC for some time to come.  Thank you.

Passage number 303.
 MR. HOENIG. Well, Mr. Chairman, in our District, clearly conditions do remain weak, but the information we are receiving suggests the contraction has lessened, and expectations for future growth have actually improved.  We are seeing some reductions in residential real estate inventories in the lower-priced housing sector, partly because house prices have adjusted and partly because of some credits for first-time home buyers.  Manufacturing continues to contract, but there are signs that the decline has moderated noticeably.  Our May manufacturing survey showed that the pace of decline in production has actually reversed and in employment and capital spending it has stabilized.  Preliminary results from our June survey further indicate that we are close to almost recovery levels in terms of District manufacturing.  Our energy sector, having fallen pretty significantly, has stabilized, but we are primarily producers of natural gas, so stabilizing is about as good as we expect for any time soon.  Commercial real estate remains a source of pretty considerable weakness. Our directors and District business contacts indicate that   a combination of higher vacancy rates and some difficulties in obtaining financing are really limiting that market in our region. On the national front, our outlook isn’t a whole lot different from that of the Greenbook, except in one important way, and that is that we have a more aggressive policy path for interest rates. They increase almost a year sooner than some outlined in the Greenbook.  In terms of the inflation outlook, we are not seeing any pressures towards deflation and, actually, not seeing any signs at this point towards inflation either.  So I see the risks as fairly balanced as we go forward.  Thank you.

Passage number 305.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Broadly speaking, District economic conditions continue to track the national economy for the most part, as is typically the case.  There’s pronounced weakness in business investment (both in commercial construction and in spending on equipment and software), signs of stabilization in consumer spending, and continued deterioration in the labor market, although recent declines in employment have not been as severe as those at the national level.  There are some encouraging signs in terms of sales activity in the residential real estate market not related to foreclosures or short sales.  And we do have a reasonably healthy agricultural sector and a reasonably healthy energy sector. As far as the national outlook is concerned, my forecast is quite similar in most respects to the latest version of the Greenbook outlook.  I expect positive economic growth to resume momentarily and to be quite subdued initially for the reasons that have been previously well identified—continued strained credit conditions, negative wealth effects, significant job losses, and lots of excess capacity both in the services sector and in a variety of goods-producing industries, as well. But given the pace and depth of the downturn, I’ve been asking myself,   shouldn’t we expect perhaps a more typical recovery.  I haven’t been able to quite talk myself into that scenario yet, but I guess I wouldn’t entirely dismiss it.  In any event, I do expect momentum to build and growth to accelerate as we get further into 2010, and to accelerate further in 2011, basically because the problems that I just alluded to should be diminishing over time, and we’re in an environment of expansionary policies. As far as inflation is concerned, I continue to expect inflation to remain relatively low, given appropriate policy. And in this regard, I expect that the federal funds rate will have to start moving up in the latter half of next year, or early 2011 at the latest, in order to achieve that outcome.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Stern about the current economic conditions and his forecast for the future.


Passage number 306.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 307.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fifth District economic conditions are pretty well aligned with the national situation, with activity stabilizing in some areas, though at a level that’s still pretty depressed. Our manufacturing index has risen above zero from deep into negative territory, and there are encouraging signs for orders, shipments, and, to a lesser extent, capital expenditures. Nevertheless, services, residential construction, and the labor market all remain depressed. I think it does appear that the real economy is reaching something of an inflection point.  Since the turn of the year, real PCE, light motor vehicle sales, and single-family home sales, starts, and permits have leveled out and, in some cases, eked out small gains.  Initial unemployment claims have steadied and have come off their early peak.  Consumer sentiment indexes have bounced back from their lows.  The ISM manufacturing survey rallied, as did many regional surveys. Encouragingly, the new orders component poked its head above 50, and, moreover, this morning’s durable goods report seems pretty positive.  Equally heartening has been the improvement in financial market conditions.  Equity prices for financial institutions are up significantly from their lows in early March.  Bank CDS spreads have declined. A wide range of large banks have successfully issued equity and non-FDIC guaranteed debt. Three-month dollar LIBOR rates are below 1 percent.  Triple-B corporate bond yields are just below 8 percent, off from their 2008 year-end highs of 10 percent.  I think all of this suggests a substantial reduction in risk premiums.  And because the extent to which bank liabilities are government supported hasn’t changed materially over the horizon, the improvement is probably due to a better outlook for fundamentals. At the same time, these signs of stabilization do not by any means guarantee vigorous economic growth any time soon, and I don’t think they will prevent unexpected shocks, obviously. The stabilization in housing starts and auto sales is encouraging, but it’s occurring at extraordinarily low levels. The outlook for commercial real estate is not good—further increases in vacancies, delinquencies, and loan losses are in store.  And many banks face further increases in credit card losses and commercial real estate losses as well.  While, at this point, it looks as if these familiar features of cyclical downturns are going to prove manageable, they do suggest that we have a ways to go before the downturn is over and growth may be slow for a while. Since December, core PCE inflation, excluding tobacco, has come in fairly close to 1½ percent. But even though energy prices helped us late last year, gasoline prices have been increasing steadily over the last few months. We’ve seen a consistent pattern over the last several years of increases in energy prices followed by smaller but noticeable increases in core inflation with a lag of a couple of months. This pattern makes me skeptical of the Greenbook’s forecast that core PCE inflation is going to fall significantly over the next couple of months and  quarters. And it leads me to expect core inflation to remain where it is, or, if anything, to rise over the next few months. Core inflation has been reasonably well behaved so far this year.  Worries about future inflation have become disappointingly common over the last few months among financial market participants and among my contacts—people raise it independently.  And a couple of Presidents have cited concerns that link that to what people see happening to our balance sheet.  I think concerns about sustained deflation have evaporated more or less, and measures of inflation expectations have increased noticeably, obviously, since our last meeting.  They’re back to levels consistent with those we saw before the middle of last year, levels we associated with price stability. Market commentary speculated about the possibility—we talked about this a lot yesterday—that the Fed will come under pressure to monetize future deficits, given the currently unsustainable upward path they seem to be on. We’ve been reasonably clear about our planned purchases, but we provided much less information, I think, about our reaction function. I think that’s an inevitable byproduct of the urge to preserve discretion, and this is an example of the extent to which discretion can be the enemy of clarity.  That lack of clarity, I think, contributed to the belief—and maybe it’s not a predominant belief, but it is something you hear—that we might be setting a ceiling on long-term interest rates, kind of the way we did before the 1951 Accord, a period when monetary policy was very inflationary. In this context, the signs of stabilization in the real economy and financial markets make it unlikely that we could announce additional open market purchases without aggravating market concerns about inflation.  But, more broadly, whatever we do with the statement at this meeting, I think we should strive to add clarity.  About exit, I think it’s too soon to hint that it’s imminent, but at the same time I think there would be a great benefit in clarifying the extent to which we believe we know how it would work and how we could accomplish that.  And that’s sort of the delicate balance to strike in the Monetary Policy Report, I think.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 310.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I recently accompanied my wife to a board meeting of the American Film Institute, of which she is a director, in President Yellen’s District in Hollywood, and to prepare for that trip I read Evelyn Waugh’s wonderful novel The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy. The plot line is about a minor British poet who goes to write  the greatest movie of all time about the life of Percy Shelley and settles for employment at a pet cemetery called The Happy Hunting Ground.  There’s a precious scene in that novel where the tough head of the film studio is surrounded by people around a table and in the back benches.  The people around the table are described as “yes men” and those on the back benches as “nodders.” I find myself nodding and saying yes—[laughter]—to everything that has been said by my predecessors at this table.  There is a unanimity of view, it seems to me, that, as President Yellen just pointed out, the economy is bottoming out, but it is a gradual and fragile recovery, and it will take a long time to regain employment.  I forecast an almost checkmark-shaped recovery, which is a long recovery, as President Rosengren stated, with the unemployment rate masking some of the problems we have with our workforce, and I do not foresee a very quick recovery. What concerns me is that the people that I talk to, the CEO list that I give you, and even the people we talked to in that part of the country, which is not known for being plugged into reality, also have a unanimous view. I want to touch on two aspects that were mentioned by my predecessors here. The first is with regard to President Rosengren’s point that unemployment may be masking deeper problems.  Even in your District, President Rosengren, I noticed that Harvard Law School just sent out a letter recommending that their graduating class seek employment in other fields—perhaps at pet cemeteries; I’m not quite sure.  [Laughter] If you look at Skadden, Arps or Cravath, Swaine, & Moore, people that I talk to, they have deferred an entire class in terms of their hiring.  So here’s the point:  I think we also need to be cognizant of the fact that the service sector is going to have a very slow recovery in the process.  This was underscored by the CEO of AT&T, who said, “If it isn’t life or death, we’re not hiring anybody or investing in anything.” And I think that’s pretty much a unanimous view around the table of CEOs that I spoke to. Second, President Lockhart mentioned cap-ex. Cap-ex is being postponed. When you have excess slack, you’re going to have less commitment to cap-ex.  But here’s the point I want to mention:  Among the CEOs that I speak to, and even people that you would never expect to be critical—I’ll drop a name, because it was absolutely shocking, Warren Beatty, for example— there’s a unanimous worry that, “The plethora of programs coming out of Washington is creating enormous uncertainty.”  Uncertainty is the enemy of decisionmaking, the enemy of capitalism. We’ve talked about this before. It’s not that changes are being proposed.  It’s that no one knows when they will stop, and I find that this has heightened uncertainty in the business sector and is retarding cap-ex. And that won’t change until there is resolution about the enormous changes that have been proposed by the Congress, by the Administration, and so on.  It’s not that the business community and others are against the proposals, it’s that there are so many coming so quickly that it’s creating enormous uncertainty.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is mostly agreeing with what has been previously said, expressing concern about the slow recovery and uncertainty caused by proposed changes.

Passage number 314.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Well, hopefully heaven can’t wait too long.  [Laughter] I just want to amplify what President Fisher said about the uncertainty created by all of the Obama Administration initiatives.  We heard from one large firm that this is really important, especially in health care: Why would you build a new wing of a hospital if you don’t know what the reimbursement rates are going to be.   Generally, I think the economy is still very weak.  I think we’re probably at or very close to a cyclical bottom.  The market reaction, though, is really mostly, to my mind, about pricing out the tail risk of a depression rather than pricing in a strong recovery, and I think the market over the last week or two has sort of been rethinking its reaction.  What has been going on in the labor market is pretty striking.  The rise in the participation rate may be indicative of stress in terms of balance sheets and people being forced back into the labor market, even though the prospects aren’t very good. Past credit crises certainly suggest that the dynamics of recovery this time will be very different. The wealth shock is unprecedented. Credit availability is going to be constrained for quite a while. There are significant rollover risks for large groups of borrowers—the commercial mortgage market is probably the most significant one.  And it’s going to take several years, I think, for the financial system to get back to more normal functioning. One thing that struck me in looking at the macro data is how we’ve been benefiting from unusually favorable income dynamics up to now.  If you look at the trend of income relative to hours worked and wages, real disposable income growth has been very, very strong—6½ percent at an annual rate in the first quarter and on pace by the New York Fed forecast for a 4.2 percent annual rise in the second quarter. That has allowed the saving rate to rise sharply without triggering a big fall in consumer spending.  The problem is that the factors underlying the sharp rise are all behind us: the big increase in transfer payments, automatic stabilizers, the large COLA for Social Security caused by the big run-up in energy prices last year, the tax cuts, changes in withholding rates in April, and payments made to Social Security recipients in May and June.   Looking forward, the trend in real disposable income is going to be much worse in the second half of the year—we’re probably going to see actual declines.  So we’re assuming that consumption will rise despite the fact that disposable personal income is falling, and the saving rate will fall as a consequence.  But I think there is a risk to the downside, because maybe the saving rate won’t fall and consumption will just be weaker than we anticipated. The other thing I am worried about is this:  I think it’s very premature to rule out further financial market disruptions.  A couple of times in the crisis we’ve thought that things were getting better, and then there was another shock.  Obviously, when Lehman failed, we had no idea what the macroeconomic consequences of that were going to be.  One thing I am worried about is that the TLGP is almost certainly going to end September 30, so that means financial institutions are going to face more rollover risk for all the debt that’s coming due after September 30.  And we still have several very large, systemically important institutions that are very fragile and that have broad international operations.  We don’t have a resolution mechanism to deal with them if they get into difficulties.  And the political will to help these firms if they do get into trouble, I think, is quite a bit subdued compared to what it was a year ago.  So I think that’s something to be concerned about. On inflation, I think the near-term outlook is that core inflation is going to moderate from where it has been.  The tobacco taxes are sort of a funny anomaly—how you raise taxes shouldn’t really affect the inflation numbers, but it does in certain cases.  Inflation expectations seem to be well anchored despite some worries about monetization of the debt, and we have a very large output gap. To make sure that we keep inflation expectations well anchored, I think we need to do more in articulating why will be able to exit smoothly.  The biggest upside risk on inflation to me would be a broad loss of confidence in the U.S. abroad caused by worries aboutfiscal sustainability and the independence of the Fed.  The only way I can see getting a big inflation problem any time soon is if the dollar were to collapse.  There’s probably some risk of that, but I think it should be very low as long as we communicate clearly that we have the tools to manage our exit smoothly and that we are committed to long-term price stability, regardless of what the fiscal authorities do. Thank you.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 321.
   MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ve already highlighted some of my views on policy yesterday and earlier today.  Let me just sort of clarify.  My view of the outlook for the real economy is really not much different from most people’s around the table—near-term  weakness, with modest growth returning in 2010.  In fact, my own forecast is for less growth in 2011 than the Greenbook’s—a slow recovery in the economy in many respects.  I don’t disagree with that.   Where I disagree has more to do with the nature and the specification of the Phillips curve and how that guides both our inflation forecast and its implications for policy.  I don’t believe that the empirical relationship with gaps or slack is nearly as tight and predictable and reliable as oftentimes we think it is, so my concern is that we have to be careful about that.  I would remind the Committee that, between 1991 and 1996, the staff, according to the chart they handed out yesterday, had substantial output gaps ranging from 2 to 4 percent for most of that period, and inflation hardly budged—it remained between 2½ and 3 percent during that whole period. So while I don’t want to rely on anecdotal information, it is true that this link between output gaps and inflation is not a very strong one.  I think we have to be cautious about relying too heavily on that. My skepticism about the measurement of those gaps and the relationships with inflation is most relevant for the deliberations we will have about when it’s time to reverse course and how we decide when that time is.  I think that’s going to be a very difficult choice, given the uncertainty surrounding these relationships. A tightening cycle will inevitably occur, and   choosing the right time to do it is going to be important for our future ability to achieve price stability. I also think that, historically, this institution has been somewhat slow on the uptake many times.  If we rely too heavily on measures of slack in labor markets or unemployment rate gaps, we will inevitably find ourselves behind the curve, because we know unemployment rates take a long time to turn around, and the economy will turn around before that.  If we wait until the unemployment rate becomes an unacceptable level to reverse course, I’m fairly confident that we will be well behind the curve. So my point is really about the nature of the Phillips curve, and about the reliability of those estimates, and about our ability to rely on them for policy decisions during this critical time. I believe the economy is in this sort of bumpy transition from dramatic contraction hopefully to expansion. I agree with everyone that there are substantial risks to that forecast, and we need to be conscious of those risks and those concerns.  I’m very supportive, as I said yesterday, of the staff’s proposals on winding down the facilities.  I am opposed to increasing our large-scale asset purchases.  I think we need to be very cautious in that effort.  We still have a ways to go, so we still could increase purchases if we chose to do so.  And I don’t believe we ought to make decisions about adding to that volume very precipitously or quickly.  I would also hope that the argument is symmetric; that is, if the economy improves and evolves in the way that many of us are hoping it will over the course of the fall, then we may not necessarily have to go to the full limit on some of these programs.  I think we have to make that clear to the public as well. A major issue I see in the policy decision today has to do with language—I think it’s the communication effort that’s going to be so difficult.  I think ultimately we are going to have to  find a way to extract ourselves from the current language of “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” That’s why I am somewhat sympathetic to the first part of paragraph 3 in alternative C, although I wouldn’t be nearly as explicit about the timing in that paragraph: “until late this year.”  I would sort of strike that and just say, “for some time.”  Even if we raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, it’s still exceptionally low, so I’m not sure that the difference between level and changes here is important. Given my hesitancy and skepticism about tying our inflation forecast too tightly to slack measures, I actually am happier with paragraph 2 in alternative B than I was before, in the sense that both the persistence and size of the output gap become somewhat less dominant.  I would prefer C in that regard, but I think paragraph 2 is better than the version in the Bluebook that we saw, so I’m happy with that. I think we have some difficult choices before us in the coming quarters, and it would be helpful if we could continue to push for our inflation targeting goals.  I hope that that is not off the table and will continue to be pursued.  But I do think that in the coming months and coming quarters we are going to have to make some very difficult economic decisions, and we could face considerable political pressure in the face of that.  We need to prepare ourselves for that and prepare the markets for it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser disagrees with the reliability and predictability of the Phillips curve and its implications for policy. He also disagrees with increasing large-scale asset purchases and believes that the communication effort surrounding policy decisions will be difficult. Additionally, he disagrees with tying the inflation forecast too tightly to slack measures and expresses skepticism about the timing and language used in the policy statement.


Passage number 322.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Lacker.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 323.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we should continue now with the announced schedule of asset purchases. I don’t think expanding our purchases makes any sense now, given the stabilization of the economy, the diminution of concerns about deflation, and the emergence of some scattered concerns about inflation.  I agree with you that we’ve sort of   normalized inflation and inflation expectations at this point, and we’re okay where we are.  But given that, I don’t think it makes sense to provide more stimulus.   It’s true that our credit programs have run off more rapidly than we expected as of the last meeting.  As I discussed yesterday, it means our balance sheet is smaller, so you might think that it provides less stimulus than you would otherwise expect.  I outlined another perspective, where some components of borrowing respond endogenously, as sort of a residual.  This perspective is based on the notion that the demand for reserves isn’t perfectly elastic at current rates. That would suggest that the degree of stimulus hasn’t turned out to be much different from what we expected it to have been. I’m happy that the Desk didn’t attempt to offset the shortfall in the balance sheet, as the discussion at our last meeting might have led them to think I would have desired. I’m broadly apprehensive about the increases in reserves implied by completing the path of asset purchases we’re on.  As I’ve indicated, I think the impact depends on the nature of the demand for bank reserves.  If what I outlined yesterday has some validity, then, at some point, all that buffer of borrowing from us goes away, and then the nature of the impact of our balance sheet expansion shifts qualitatively. Now, whether it’s quantitatively important or not, I don’t think we know. We have all known that we’re sort of groping in the dark here as to what the exact analytics are of this balance sheet expansion as monetary stimulus.  But I think the kind of thing I outlined yesterday deserves some consideration, and it makes me apprehensive about following all the way through on the purchases. Now, I’m not saying I have any idea about when we’re going to want to withdraw stimulus, or how the economy will play out.  It just strikes me as plausible that we get to a state where we need to think about exit. I don’t know when that is, and I can’t pretend that I do.  But I think that, when we do get there, we’re going to need to be cognizant of the elasticity of demand   for reserves. In consequence, I think we ought to give some consideration at the next few meetings to lower paths for our asset purchases.  If we get outcomes that are on the good side of what we are expecting, in the fourth quarter we could find ourselves in a situation where we want to pull back on what we’ve planned. I also think maybe a less gradual unwinding of the assets ought to be on the table. I applaud the staff again, by the way, for all of the good work they’ve done so far on our exit strategy. But I think we’d all admit we have a little more to do. I’m happy with alternative B.  I’m happy omitting the bracketed sentence at the end.  I’m not quite sure what it means.  I’m not quite sure about the extent to which we have taken account of ensuring that our policy accommodation can be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.  So I’m not sure how we’d explain it to people.  And, besides, I think it’s a little too soon to convey, as I think the sentence would, that we think of exit as likely to be imminent enough to warrant our mentioning it in the statement.  At the same time, I do think it’s important, as I said earlier, to convey in the Monetary Policy Report, or elsewhere, that we have a grasp on this and we’re working hard on it. Also, I’m happy omitting the statement in paragraph 2 about inflation being at low levels—I think it’s important to acknowledge the shift in inflation outlook.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Mr. Lacker argues against expanding asset purchases and expresses concerns about the impact of the balance sheet expansion on the economy. He also suggests considering lower paths for asset purchases and a less gradual unwinding of assets. This contrasts with the views of others who may support continuing with the announced schedule of asset purchases.


Passage number 324.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply expresses gratitude to President Lockhart without presenting any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 325.
 MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like President Lacker, I favor alternative B in both substance and wording. I think the staff captured my view with their description of alternative B, which said the slow pace of recovery is largely unavoidable in light of the nature and severity of the global financial crisis and the time required for healing and other structural adjustments.  I think alternative B also recognizes the tentative nature of improvement in the economy, so I see it as a “stay the course” policy.  As mentioned yesterday, the balance sheet is   expected to grow to approximately $2.8 trillion, so I think the playing out of programs as currently designed should represent sufficient stimulus to sustain the progress we’ve seen. I am sympathetic to the view that was expressed by both Presidents Plosser and Lacker that if we see better results, we should consider scaling back the LSAP programs.  At the same time, I think it would be a mistake to react too early and strongly to the signs of stabilization and better financial market conditions.  As many said yesterday and today, we have a particularly subtle communication task coming out of this meeting.  I think we need to encourage positive views that can be self-reinforcing to stabilization and ultimately to recovery.  But I also think we have to present a sober characterization of the state of and outlook for the economy, and we should be signaling that we’re not withdrawing stimulus and support for the economy at this time.  It’s okay, I believe, to signal that we’re thinking and planning for an eventual exit, but not initiating an exit. Yesterday, I supported—though I didn’t speak for it—the plan presented by Brian Madigan for the expiration of the facilities, and I agree that the press release should and does emphasize the conditionality of that plan.  I think much of the communication task, as discussed yesterday afternoon, should be accomplished after today’s statement, for example, in the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. On the statement itself, I can support it as it’s presented.  In the revised proposal, I favored B′ before it was eliminated.  I think it is continuous with the April statement and gives a “stay the course” message.  As I said earlier, it accurately captures the economic conditions.  I think the inflation language is a logical update to the April language, and since my forecast does not assume an increase in the policy rate this year or next, I’m comfortable for the time being with the “extended period” language. And finally, I do not support the bracketed statement that was appended. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses his support for alternative B and the communication strategy proposed. He also agrees with the proposed expiration plan for facilities and the press release emphasizing the conditionality of that plan. Overall, he is supportive of the statement as presented.


Passage number 326.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Yellen.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 327.
 MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B, although on purely policy grounds I think that a strong case exists for further monetary stimulus.  The economy appears to be stabilizing and downside risk has declined, but it will be many years before the economy is close to operating at full employment.  Not surprisingly, the Bluebook optimal policy simulation shows that the stance of policy is not even close to the optimal degree of accommodation. As the Bluebook points out, unemployment is anticipated to run around 1½ percentage points higher on the constrained path than on the unconstrained path for the next three to four years, and this translates into a cumulative loss on the order of 10 percent of GDP, or $1½ trillion, and creates a very strong case for doing everything possible to stimulate the economy.  The problem is that the obvious remaining tool, large-scale Treasury purchases, may be less effective than hoped and may entail a variety of unquantifiable costs, as we have discussed. I wouldn’t want to take an expansion of this program off the table if the economy were to worsen, but I wouldn’t push for an expansion now. The bottom line for me is that we likely will need to maintain the current stance of policy for a very long time to get back to full employment, and my main concern is that markets will anticipate and we may be tempted to withdraw our accommodation too soon, thereby aborting the recovery.  Christina Romer recently wrote a pertinent essay for The Economist on “The Lessons of 1937” that you may have read.  As many of you know, in that year, following two years of robust recovery, the Federal Reserve tightened policy too soon because it was worried about large quantities of excess reserves in the banking system.  The economy plunged back into depression, and I believe that a parallel can be found in Japan’s experience of the 1990s as well.  So I think we need to do all that we can to avoid creating the impression that we intend to raise the federal funds rate any time soon.  For this reason I definitely prefer to drop the final sentence in brackets in B concerning exit strategy.  By bringing this issue up in the policy statement, I am afraid we will reinforce the market’s impression that we may begin to tighten policy sooner rather than later.  I think discussions of exit strategy would be better handled in testimony or speeches by the Chairman.  In the event that a reference is included in this statement, I have a very small wording change to propose.  Currently the statement refers to taking “careful account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn.” The phrase “can ultimately be withdrawn” sounds to me like we’re not sure we can do it or that we may refrain from easing policy in particular ways later on because of our concern about our ability to withdraw. So if it is included, I would prefer a more confident wording, namely, “ensuring that policy accommodation is ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.”  So I would essentially change “can be” to “is.” I also have a wording suggestion to make in paragraph 1 concerning the outlook, and my objective here, again, is to make the statement slightly less optimistic, slightly less able to be interpreted as saying that we are anywhere close to withdrawing stimulus, and, in my view, slightly more balanced.  I propose adding to a sentence in paragraph 1 of B to recognize that even though financial conditions have improved on balance, which is a net positive for the outlook, the increase in mortgage rates we have seen has the potential to impede recovery in the housing market.  In particular, I would propose the following language:  “Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months, although the sharp rise in mortgage rates has the potential to impede recovery in the housing market.  Indicators of consumer and business sentiment…” and so on.  I think the increase in mortgage rates has been substantial.  It is one of the most important and most discussed developments since our last meeting, and it does create a risk to the outlook.  I think it deserves mention in the statement as a negative factor that partially offsets what is a net improvement.  I also would argue for including it for the sake of balance.  I think it parallels our discussion in the very next sentence that says that there are some factors restraining household spending, and again, in the inflation section where we mention increases in the prices of energy and commodities as an offset to our view that inflation will remain generally subdued.  So that’s a concrete suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker supports alternative B, but disagrees on the need for further monetary stimulus. They believe that the economy is stabilizing and downside risk has declined, so they do not see a need for additional stimulus. However, they are concerned about the potential for withdrawing accommodation too soon and causing an economic downturn. They also propose changes to the wording of the policy statement to make it less optimistic and to acknowledge the potential negative impact of increased mortgage rates on the housing market.


Passage number 328.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply consists of a polite expression of gratitude and a mention of someone's title, President Evans.


Passage number 329.
 MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I took some comfort from our discussion yesterday on reserve management tools, although we had discussions about these before.  It does seem as if these tools are likely to be enough to allow tightening when we need it. Previously I would have thought that we would have to grapple with the problem of getting our balance sheet in better shape and that markets would see that coming well before we ever got to a positive federal funds rate.  So I guess I’m more persuaded—although the continued staff analysis will be helpful on this—that it’s likely to be more contemporaneous; that is, when we decide that we need to tighten, we can bring these tools to bear quickly and may not have to signal very much in advance. I think that’s very helpful, because part of what we’re grappling with right now is how to position ourselves for doing the tightening a few meetings or several meetings into the future.  I don’t have a firm opinion really on when it’s likely to be the case that we’ll need to tighten. I think it’s pretty far in the future, 2010 maybe.   On the large-scale asset purchases, I guess I prefer leaving them the way they are, given the improvement in the economy.  If at the next meeting we think it’s going to be important to  communicate about a tapering-off strategy—if we are worried about the cliff—I think we probably need to decide now about how to communicate that.  If we wait, then the cliff is going to be that much closer, and you’re not really going to be able to do this with the existing size. So if you want to maintain the existing size, I think you would need to do that soon, like today probably. But it’s not in the statement. On the inflation forecast, it does seem to me that there’s a pretty wide dispersion of forecasts for core PCE in 2011, which is not that far away—so the dispersion is a bit unusual.  If you take out the high and the low, then it’s ½ to 2 percent.  I hope that the minutes will reflect this diversity of opinion in a slightly robust fashion, because that debate is taking place out in the public. We all go out and face very difficult questions, and even though we might feel pretty confident about our outlook for inflation, this dispersion of views is sort of a reality check as to how we deal with that. On inflation forecasts, it does seem like there is substantial resource slack now. It has been a very deep contraction, and so my own forecast is relatively low.  Even if you allow for differences of NAIRUs, it’s a big amount of slack. But there are risks, and we know the theory says that inflation expectations can “take off.” That would be a key element in inflation determination and our forecast.  Events somewhat beyond our control—fiscal pressures and how they are dealt with in the large number of programs that are coming down the pike, as President Fisher reminded us—and our balance sheet size are adding to this risk. I think what we’ve been doing is appropriate, but it does add to the risk. So I think a lot of it comes down to how much confidence we have in a particular forecast, and some people are inclined to write a larger number for 2011, and others are inclined to write down a much smaller number.  I kind of prefer to take the middle course, but in this particular bimodal situation, these opposing forces are difficult.  So normally in a situation like   this, we can fall back on timing:  We don’t have to do this today, and in the worst case, we’re several meetings before the pressure erupts, and, Mr. Chairman, you will be providing testimony soon in your Monetary Policy Report, and that would be a natural way to communicate that.  But it does seem as though these issues have been out there, you’ve been out front in talking about them.  So I just don’t know exactly what the likely impact is going to be from delivering that message again. So even though the bimodal beliefs are quite different, I prefer the middle course, and so I do prefer alternative B. On the particular issues for the statement, I’m not bothered by the bracketed statement at the end.  I guess if I were going to make the best case, it is that it seems accurate that we will continue to take careful account of this.  We’ve got the reserve management tools.  We’ve just had a meeting where we talked an awful lot about it.  So it’s not inappropriate to raise this now. The Chairman and others have talked about exactly this issue, and probably have used words very similar to this.  We say it in public.  So what does it mean if we don’t say it here in the statement but we say it in public.  Well, we can always ask that question because that’s not an uncommon type of omission.  It does seem as if the language in the second paragraph gets at this middle ground for inflation, because we took out the part saying something like “inflation could be uncomfortably low,” or whatever the language was indicating that it could be suboptimal.  So I’m comfortable with alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinions and preferences on various topics, but there is no mention of disagreement or opposition.


Passage number 330.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention or imply any disagreement or contention related to President Rosengren.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 331.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The forecast has high unemployment rates and low inflation rates through 2011, and the Greenbook forecast expects an undesirably low inflation rate even at the end of 2013. Missing both elements of the dual mandate through 2011 and possibly beyond strongly suggests to me that we should attempt to provide more   stimulus both to avoid a multiyear elevated unemployment rate and to avoid a prolonged period of lower than desired inflation. Mortgage and Treasury rates have risen despite our large-scale asset purchase program.  The increase in Treasury rates likely reflects the reduced precautionary demand for that asset as financial markets have improved.  However, the increase in mortgage rates is likely to slow both residential investment and consumption relative to what they would be if we were pushing rates lower. There has been a reluctance to intervene more aggressively in the thirty-year mortgage market because it is felt that this would disrupt market functioning.  But if our LSAPs cannot produce mortgage rates that are low enough to spur refinancing and new construction, then we have dramatically expanded our balance sheet with little to show for it. I believe we can and should do more.  While I support alternative B, I would encourage the Desk to further reduce mortgage rates relative to Treasury rates.  Furthermore, since the market for five- and seven-year ARMs is already quite limited, aggressive activity in ARMs would restore the market and provide a low-cost alternative for some homebuyers willing to float after five or seven years.  Because of the lack of activity, setting a low rate in this market and increasing volume would not disrupt market functioning.  In fact, it would resuscitate the market.  These ARMs also have some appeal for our balance sheet since they mature relatively quickly, making the exit strategy easier for these assets.  Acting more aggressively to restore the ARM market and to further reduce the spread relative to Treasuries for longer-maturity mortgages seem like appropriate steps to gain greater confidence that we will achieve both elements of our dual mandate within a reasonable time horizon. I would emphasize that the experience of the past seven years has taught us that conducting monetary policy in a very low-inflation environment is not as straightforward as we  might have wished.  At some point, we should have a fuller discussion of our inflation goal in light of the probability of reaching the zero lower bound in the future and the difficulty in conducting monetary policy when we are at the zero bound. In terms of what’s in the statement, I actually would not be for having the final sentence.  We have not been communicating the path of the LSAP program.  I think we can taper as appropriate without necessarily having to discuss how we’re going to taper it.  I do prefer President Yellen’s language—I do think it’s appropriate to mention the rise in rates, because it has been quite appreciable, and it has been probably the biggest news that we’ve had in the last month in terms of what has been going on in the financial markets.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: There is contention or disagreement in the passage because the speaker is advocating for more stimulus to address high unemployment rates and low inflation rates, while also expressing frustration that the large-scale asset purchase program has not had the desired effect on mortgage and Treasury rates. The speaker believes that more aggressive intervention in the mortgage market, particularly with adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), could help stimulate the housing market and improve the overall economy.


Passage number 332.

Passage number 333.
 MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I don’t know if we’re at a turning point in economic activity, although I don’t think we’re far away.  But one thing I do know is that when you’re close to or at turning points, there’s always a tremendous amount of uncertainty:  It’s very difficult to read the state of the economy; it’s very difficult to come to a conclusion with confidence as to how the economy is going to perform going forward in this kind of environment. The reason I mention that is that I think decisionmaking isn’t going to get any easier any time soon.  I think this is going to characterize things probably for the next year and perhaps more. In this environment with all of this uncertainty, one nice rule of thumb might be to do no harm, especially since recent trends, while certainly not great, are better than they had been and in some ways better than we had anticipated just a few months ago.  So I wouldn’t change any policy parameters at this point with regard to purchases of longer-term assets or other parameters that we might think about.  Yesterday I commented that I didn’t think we had a problem  convincing market participants that we were prepared to do what it would take to restore financial stability and ultimately economic health.  I think people believe that and understand that. I’m a little less convinced that they understand that we do have an exit strategy and will execute it appropriately. Against that background, and to begin to address that concern, I can favor either President Plosser’s alternative C—the one he described in the material he distributed late last week—or alternative B as presented here with that last sentence in brackets included.  (It’s okay with me if it’s modified along the lines that President Yellen suggested.)  I don’t think that sentence will be read as if we’re about to change policy any time soon.  As President Evans commented, people have been talking about that publicly.  I think that would provide reassurance to people in the marketplace and people in the economy more generally that we are aware of the challenge and we’re prepared to address it:  We know we’re in an environment where our balance sheet has expanded tremendously and is likely to expand further, given our plans, and where there’s a very expansionary fiscal policy in place with no end in sight.  I think it would be appropriate to make that point clear.  Thank you.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 335.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I noted at the end of my remarks, I don’t think the central tendency that we’ve submitted is really a satisfactory outcome for the economy.  We’re looking at an unemployment rate—just considering the center of the central tendency—of about 8½ percent in two and a half years and an inflation rate of 1½ percent, which is below the 2 percent that most of us have favored; and that’s probably headed lower unless the economy picks up steam very, very fast after that.  I think that’s why most Taylor rules and the optimal control simulations that President Yellen mentioned call for negative nominal interest rates now. Moreover, I think from a risk-management perspective, which we used to talk about around here, even though the risks are more balanced on either side of this sluggish recovery now than they were, I think the cost of a shortfall is greater than the cost of an overshoot.  We know how to counter inflation. We’ve done it before and we can do it again.  But this central tendency tells me that, given the size of the shock, we’re having trouble getting satisfactory outcomes for output and inflation.  I think the risk, as President Bullard pointed out, is that we could be caught in a high-output-gap, low-inflation or even deflationary environment.  I don’t think that’s going to happen, but I think there’s a risk there, and if we get caught in that, I think it’s very, very difficult to figure out how to get out of it.  This seemed to be much easier, Mr. Chairman, when we were lecturing Japan than when we’re doing it ourselves.  [Laughter] Everybody had a solution for them, and somehow when you’re there, there are a lot of complications, aren’t there. So of the two possible policy errors—moving toward tightening too soon and moving too late—I’m more worried that we’ll move too soon than that we’ll move too late.  I think we can correct that latter one. I don’t think there is anything we can do about this now, despite the lack of satisfactory outcome.  Because of inflation sensitivity, because of exit worries, because of concerns about monetization of the debt in the presence of a large and uncertain fiscal path, I’m not advocating more policy action today.  I think we should continue with our purchases.  I would go up to the limits that we’ve set, and I would include the ARMs—at least a small amount of the ARMs—in those purchases, hoping to have a positive effect on mortgage markets.  I hope our next decision is how and when to remove accommodation, to remove the quantitative and interest rate accommodation, but I don’t rule out the possibility that we could take future easing actions if circumstances called for it—that would be more large-scale asset purchases, possibly,  and, to my mind, lowering the interest rate on excess reserves would help as well.  So I would be careful not to say something that rules out the possibility of doing something more later.  In response to President Stern, I’d be concerned that putting that sentence in here would cast doubt on whether we’re willing to use all of the tools available under the circumstances. I think that it’s far too soon to signal that the exit is drawing closer; furthermore, if we’re seen as worried about the exit and looking carefully at it, it will undermine our effect.  I agree with everyone else—we need to be very, very clear that we will be able to exit when we decide to exit. But I don’t think we’re anywhere close to making that decision.  So I support the language of alternative B without the bracketed sentence.  I do think removing this sentence about inflation being less than desirable from the second paragraph will be seen as a little bit more hawkish, a little bit more worried about inflation than we were before.  I think we could justify keeping the sentence based on the forecasts that we have from the Committee, but the forecasts have been revised up and certainly the degree to which the Committee expects inflation to be less than it ideally should be has been reduced to some extent. I think it’s especially important to keep in the sentence about continuing to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for a time.  I think we need to signal to the market that, even if they’ve changed their expectations for future interest rates, we have not, at least not appreciably.  And finally, on President Yellen’s point, I guess I’d be concerned that putting in her whole sentence would really undermine the sense that financial conditions had improved and that the economy was in the process of bottoming out.  If we did anything, I would just add something like, “Although mortgage interest rates have risen, conditions in financial markets have improved on balance in recent months.”  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kohn expresses concerns about the central tendency projections for the economy and argues for negative nominal interest rates and continued policy action. He disagrees with the idea of tightening too soon and believes there is a risk of high-output-gap, low-inflation or deflationary environment. He also disagrees with President Stern's suggestion to include a sentence about the exit strategy drawing closer. He believes it is too soon to signal that and it would undermine the effectiveness of the Fed. Finally, he disagrees with President Yellen's suggestion to include a sentence about mortgage interest rates rising, arguing that it would undermine the sense that financial conditions had improved.


Passage number 336.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Bullard.


Passage number 337.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Bullard, we already moved it from the top of the statement all the way down to paragraph 3.  [Laughter]  I thought that was a fair compromise, by the way. President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a comment about a decision or arrangement that has been made, but there is no conflict or disagreement expressed. The laughter in the passage further suggests a friendly and cordial tone.


Passage number 338.
 MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook assumes that our policy accommodation is going to continue for some time, and yet the recovery is still quite prolonged.  As has been noted, financial market conditions have improved somewhat during the intermeeting period, but those improvements have taken place alongside of continuing significant public policy interventions.  So a little progress has been made, but I think the economy needs a considerable amount of time to cement that progress.  In this environment, I think we have room to continue to evaluate the outlook and the effects of our current programs.  So I support alternative B. Given Brian’s comments about the uncertainty on how the language in the bracketed sentence would be received, I would just leave it out.  Given that we are going to have a Monetary Policy Report and that you are going to give testimony in the near future, I would just rely on those vehicles to address some of these issues more fully.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's perspective and support for a particular alternative. There is no mention of any opposing views or conflicting opinions in the passage.


Passage number 339.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement is a simple expression of gratitude towards President Hoenig.


Passage number 340.
 MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m fine with alternative B, and I would at some point—not today, but in the future—have a preference for C.  I could work with the language that’s in the brackets, but it’s not essential to me. Obviously, the economy remains weak.  But, as the discussion and as the projections have indicated, it’s also true that economic and financial conditions have improved.  We expect to see some modest improvement in economic growth, perhaps in the latter part of this year and even next year, as we’ve discussed. We’re now in a situation where the data are changing, and we are beginning to talk about the possibility of a turning point, and in that regard, I agree with President Stern—the data are mixed, and they will be mixed for some time. Looking toward the decisions ahead of us, I think that, given the mixed data and given the experiences that we had in the fall of 2007 and in the summer of 2008, there will be an enormous power of inertia at this table not to make that downward mistake.  It’s hard to perceive that the monetary and fiscal stimulus that’s in place, as significant it is, will really carry the day forward.  We’re going to resist that until we actually see the data.  Furthermore, this period of low inflation is going to kind of reinforce our view that we should wait and we should make sure that the recovery is strong.  I think that’s where we do risk the other side of this, and that’s how we create inflationary issues or bubbles four or five years down the road because of this extended period of accommodation, and we shouldn’t lose sight of that.  I think it’s extremely important. With that in mind, I was pleased that we had the conversation yesterday about our exit strategy. My goals around that are that we find ourselves in a position where we can talk about our policy rate being moved back towards neutral and we can talk about the fact that we’re shrinking our balance sheet and the degree of excess reserves.  I agree that we don’t want to repeat the experience of the late 1930s, but that was a very blunt movement up in reserve requirements.  Hopefully we’ve learned that lesson and would be much more sensitive and much more gradual. Given the degree of stimulus, I think it will take us years to even get back close to neutral. So the economy is going to be growing slowly, but our moves back toward neutral also will be very slow. Another goal, besides shrinking our balance sheet, should be restoring the composition of our balance sheet. We are now in the credit allocation business towards the housing market, and that, of course, gives me some pause.  I do think that a case can be made for scaling back our asset purchase program, doing less than is currently authorized. When we originally began these purchases some months ago, the outlook was considerably weaker. Deflation was a possibility, although a small one, and financial stress was, in fact, elevated. With the improving economic and financial conditions, with the very significant fiscal stimulus beginning to kick in, and with deflation even less of a threat, I think it would be prudent to reevaluate these purchases and determine whether we need to go up to the total amount.  That is what I mentioned yesterday about carefully reviewing that at each meeting.  I also would be very reluctant to expand the Treasury purchase program.  Given the size of the debt that is being issued, the optics on that can be nothing but harmful going forward. So we have lots to think about in the long term, and I want to begin to raise the need for that long-term perspective today, even though some decisions along those lines are still in the future. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It mainly consists of the speaker expressing their preferences, opinions, and concerns regarding the current economic situation and future actions.


Passage number 341.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage "Thank you. President Fisher." It is a simple expression of gratitude to President Fisher.


Passage number 342.
 MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I’m in favor of alternative B.  I appreciate some of the restructuring that was made from the previous draft.  I agree with President Yellen that we ought to change the wording in that last bracketed sentence, because I’m in favor of including that sentence, and here’s why. I think the market is asking us to at least clarify that we have thought about an exit strategy. With all due respect to Brian, whose work I admire enormously—both Brians, by the way—I think we might actually get a negative market reaction unless we clarify, at least in the very general terms in which this has been described.  “The Committee will continue to take careful account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation,” as Janet said, “is (or will be) ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.”  It   doesn’t say too much.  I think it tees up your congressional testimony. I agree in this sense with President Evans and President Stern; I certainly am not opposed to including it, and, in fact, I think we should include it. If we did, and I would urge us to consider it, then I don’t think we need to say “continues to anticipate.”  That’s a little bit too conditional.  Mr. Vice Chairman, I get your point—we are “continuing to,” but the fact is we do anticipate.  Plus, we use the word “continue” twice in one paragraph.  So I would urge you to consider, Mr. Chairman, including that last sentence. It is a truism.  It is, indeed, a fact that we are taking account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation is or will be ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at an appropriate time.  I don’t see what it costs us, and I do think there is a general explicit and implicit expectation that we do so. One other comment:  I haven’t thought this through tremendously, but I don’t necessarily disagree with President Rosengren’s suggestion, because I think the Desk ought to have some leeway with regard to the mortgage-backed securities.  As everybody in this room knows, I thought the Treasury purchase program was a mistake.  It was a very expensive mistake.  I don’t think it has helped. I think has actually set us back a little bit, and obviously I wouldn’t be in favor of extending it any further.  But now that we’re there, we might continue the program until it’s done. But I think the Desk might have some discretion, and we might so instruct the Desk— not in this statement—but they might work their way around the yield curve a bit for mortgage-backed securities and into certain types of mortgage-backed securities.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses the speaker's opinions and suggestions.


Passage number 343.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement "Thank you. Governor Warsh" expresses gratitude and does not involve any conflicting views or opposing arguments.


Passage number 344.
 MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have three points.  First, I think it is likely we’ll need to remove our policy accommodation sooner than the Greenbook indicates, but I think  it’s unlikely we’ll begin to remove it as quickly as markets currently suggest.  Second, given the commitments that we have made, notwithstanding the “up to” language, on the asset purchases, while I’m not in favor of extending that obligation, I do think we should work to achieve that existing commitment, for credibility purposes.  Third, I support alternative B and will just make a few comments on language. With respect to the last sentence, I think it is essential that markets understand that we are taking these exit considerations seriously.  I think that is good both for actions that we could take that are even more aggressive—that they know we’re taking it with full understanding and confidence that we can exit—and for actions that we have already undertaken. Having said that, I don’t think this is the right place to be making that argument.  I don’t think our experience in the last few years in using this statement for nuance or for volume control has proven to be the most effective way of doing so.  I think we have ample opportunities through you, Mr. Chairman, to be very clear about the need for exit and these considerations.  So, on balance, though I’m sympathetic to the truth of it, I think it would be more prudent for you to make this point clear and consistent in your Monetary Policy Report and other speaking opportunities. If the bracketed sentence were in, we’d be proving a little too much.  To me, the fact that we’re now entering this into the statement does have the feel of sort of protesting.  So on balance, I would favor not doing it, though I am, of course, comfortable with the substance. I just want to flag the penultimate sentence.  “The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet.”  I like it, and I think it helps for the announcement that we make on Thursday, about Brian Madigan’s recommendations, which is pretty important.  I think it’s nice that we have a bridge to that, so that market participants and reporters alike don’t think   that we have, in their view, yet again surprised them on what the substance is.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear indications of contention or disagreement. The speaker is sharing their own thoughts and preferences on various topics, but there is no indication of opposition or disagreement with others.


Passage number 345.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It only consists of a polite expression of gratitude and addressing someone as "Governor Duke."


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 346.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m going to be quite repetitive, so I’ll be very brief. I, too, am troubled by the projections not being consistent with our dual mandate.  However, with Treasuries as the only option for expansion, I’m not at all convinced that a modest increase in our Treasury purchases brings us that much closer to our objective.  And I am concerned about the difficulties with exiting an even larger balance sheet.  So I support alternative B, and I would omit the final sentence in light of the risk that the interpretation would be that our exit is imminent.  Finally, I would echo President Rosengren’s and Governor Kohn’s support of option ARMs. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses concern about the projections not being consistent with the dual mandate and also raises doubts about the effectiveness of increasing Treasury purchases. They also express concern about the difficulties of exiting a larger balance sheet. This suggests disagreement with the idea of pursuing certain actions.


Passage number 347.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there doesn't seem to be any contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude to Governor Tarullo.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 348.
 MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I must confess to being somewhat discomfited by what I see as a disconnect between the analyses of the economy, which I alluded to in the earlier go-round, and the fact that when it comes to policy there seems to be more concern about the potential for inflation some years out than there is with the serious underperformance of the economy today and for the foreseeable future. I understood our action in March to be an effort to provide further accommodation in the circumstance of zero-bound rates.  I think it’s very difficult to make a judgment now as to exactly what effect that has had.  It does seem, as President Yellen mentioned earlier, that there is a strong theoretical case, that the counterfactual is difficult to come by, and that it is, other than statements of future intentions, really the only policy tool available to us.  I was somewhat attracted by not an option in the Bluebook, but an option included in the June 16 memo from the two Brians, which was to modestly stretch out the Treasury purchase program until the end of the year.  I was attracted to that for a variety of reasons.  One is that it just created a certain time symmetry in our decisionmaking, because the MBS and agency debt programs go through the end of the year.  That, in turn, avoided what I fear is now going to be an enormous spotlight placed upon us at the August meeting, which is going to be interpreted as the moment of truth in deciding what happens now with the large-scale asset purchase programs.  I also thought that it might offset, to some degree, what I continue to fear is going to be the interpretation of market actors and economic observers more generally—not simply that we failed to expand today, but, within the context of the announcement to come tomorrow, the announcement likely to come from the FDIC, and, precisely as President Fisher has noted, because there seems to be a demand that we talk about scaling back the program, that this inaction will be seen as a beginning response to those demands, which, for obvious reasons, I think is misplaced as a policy matter.  Having said all of that, I note that there is little or no appetite in the rest of the Open Market Committee for even this action and certainly not for what was included in the Bluebook as alternative A, which I actually wouldn’t favor at this point either. So I would be prepared to go along with alternative B.   Let me now turn to the language issues in alternative B, which, as you can imagine, also reflect some of my concerns.  Like some of the earlier speakers, I find that the first paragraph is a bit too upbeat, not just for the way that I read the economy, but, again, for the conversation we had around this table earlier this morning.  It’s not that there’s anything in there that’s wrong or that I disagree with. It’s not what is said—I guess it’s more what was left unsaid.  I was trying to figure that out overnight following dinner at the embassy and the baseball game later on in the  evening. It lacks a reference to what so many of us commented on, which is our expectation of just how slow the recovery will be when it comes.  You see gradual resumption of sustainable growth in there, but the likelihood of a long period, and a rather halting one at that, is what came through in much of what all seventeen of us said earlier in the day.  I would welcome any suggestions from anybody else as to how we might add that idea.   The more important issue to me is the potential inclusion of the final bracketed sentence, which I think would be a significant policy mistake.  And I think that for several reasons. One is my substantive policy views, which I described earlier.  But, probably more importantly for the rest of you, I think it would be a mistake precisely because of the way these statements are read, so I’m elaborating a bit on what Governor Warsh has said.  As everybody knows, anything regarded as new in these statements is invested with enormous significance.  By and large, the statement goes a little bit by increment—a word is dropped here, a phrase is added there, and people kind of masticate those changes.  If you’ve got something that is brand new, something that appears to be satisfying a demand from a certain group of market actors, I think that will be invested with enormous significance.  Under the circumstances, I don’t see that the policy position of the Open Market Committee is there, and I, for one, don’t think that we’re going to actually get there anytime soon.  I also agree with President Lacker in that I have difficulty understanding what that sentence actually means. It’s either a tautology, in which case it’s not particularly helpful, or it’s suggesting something that I don’t think we’ve actually done in a policy sense. So I think it’s both appropriate and important for the Chairman and others, either in public testimony or on background, to explicate the various considerations that were reflected in the very useful memos distributed by the staff.  But I do think that this would be the story of this Open Market Committee meeting if it were included.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo expresses his disagreement with the rest of the Open Market Committee's views on policy and the language used in alternative B. He disagrees on the focus on potential inflation instead of the underperformance of the economy, and he also disagrees with the potential inclusion of a final bracketed sentence in the language.


Passage number 349.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker, you had a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a polite expression of gratitude to President Lacker without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 350.
 MR. LACKER. Governor Tarullo, you mentioned an imminent announcement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage describes Governor Tarullo mentioning an imminent announcement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It does not indicate any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 351.
 MR. TARULLO. I think they’re likely to ramp back the guarantees that they’ve been providing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion on what they think will happen in the future, without mentioning any opposing views or engaging in any sort of argument.


Passage number 352.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 353.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the title or position of "Vice Chairman," without providing any additional information or context that may indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 354.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The statement is one way we communicate, but we also communicate in speeches.  I just want to reemphasize one more time that it’s really important in our communications to distinguish between stressing how well prepared we are to exit, in the sense of having the necessary tools, and actually exiting.  I think we have to be really clear on that, or else we are going to confuse people into thinking we’re about to exit because we’re talking about our ability to exit.  We obviously need to demonstrate that we have the ability to exit to keep inflation expectations well anchored.  But we don’t want them to think that we’re going to exit soon, or sooner than we actually think, because that will boost the expected path of short-term rates, which will raise long-term interest rates, and, therefore, choke off recovery.  So it’s tricky. If you think of long-term rates as having three major components—the expected path of real short-term rates, inflation expectations, and risk premiums—you can sort of put it in that context. Making it clear that the economy is pretty weak and that we don’t think there’s any meaningful inflation risk, so we can keep short-term rates low for an extended period, should put the focus on that first component, keeping the real rate path expectations well contained.  Making clear that we have the tools to exit smoothly, so we can keep inflation in check over the  longer term, should work on that second component by keeping inflation expectations well anchored. It also should work on the third component, because if we keep inflation expectations well anchored, there will be less dispersion in terms of inflation expectations, and that presumably will result in a lower risk premium. That’s sort of how I think about it conceptually in terms of the task at hand.  It’s not easy, but I think we have to be very, very careful in how we go forward communicating. In terms of the LSAP program, I think the tapering is not as big an issue for Treasuries, because the amount of Treasuries that were purchased is not that large relative to the flow of issuance. I think we can do it without actually saying it explicitly.  We can just purchase Treasuries at a little faster rate than the $300 billion rate over six months, and so at the end we won’t have quite as much left, so it will just taper off.  The other problem with talking about tapering is that it implies that you’re done.  If we start talking about tapering, people say, “Oh, they’re done.” I think it’s premature at this stage to make strong statements about what we want to do or not do with the purchase programs going forward, especially if the environment turns out to be worse than we expect. On the first paragraph, I agree with Governor Tarullo.  The first paragraph does sound sort of upbeat. I’m not really sure how you would fix it—maybe you could try to have some language that suggests that none of this is a real surprise.  In other words, the economy is evolving pretty closely to the forecast that we actually had, so the improvement is not a shock to us. It’s just that there are lots of other issues still outstanding that make us worry about the strength of the recovery over the longer term.  So it’s a little bit upbeat relative to what I think we really think around the table.In terms of the statement, I’m in favor of B.  On the last, bracketed sentence, my question is really:  does it reassure, or does it make the market more worried about our ability to exit and about the timing of exit.  I’m really not sure.  I think you could argue it both ways, as people around the table have done. My view is, if we’re not sure, we probably shouldn’t include it, because I go back to what Governor Warsh said:  This is not the greatest medium of communication. I think I would exclude the last sentence, just because I’m not sure how the market will react to it.  It’s probably better to take that up in the Chairman’s testimony or in the Monetary Policy Report or in speeches.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 355.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, everybody. I think that most of us are agreed that, given the improvement in the economy, there’s not much need to change our policy stance today, so we should keep our programs in place on the schedule that we have already announced. That would bring us to alternative B, which I think is the right choice.  Most of you were in favor of striking the last sentence. I think that’s the right decision.  I’m reminded of an experience I had when I first took this job, when we were still raising interest rates.  Remember that.  I told a congressional committee that the time would come, eventually, when we would have to stop raising interest rates.  Of course, the expectation of an immediate rate change went right through the market, and I was completely flabbergasted by the inability of the markets to understand plain English.  [Laughter] But, unfortunately, that’s reality.  So I think there would be a risk of suggesting that we were preparing to exit.  In this case, we are taking very substantial steps to address this particular issue, not just in testimony.  Our current plan is to have a significant description of exit strategy, tools, and so on, in the Monetary Policy Report, which would obviously be available to everyone in more detail than I could give in a short testimony.  So I would recommend dropping the last sentence.  We had some original language on tapering, and I think the problem that we were having with it was there’s no way to describe our plans to taper without essentially determining at this point that we are almost certainly going to stop.  We may well do that, but I think if we can maintain that optionality for one more meeting it would probably be a good idea.  I think we could stop the Treasury program flat, or we could say we are doing $30 billion a month the rest of the year, or whatever, but I don’t think that we need to take that decision yet. Two related things. President Yellen, supported by President Rosengren, brought up the mortgage rate issue, and I think she had two objectives.  One was to point to an important factor; the other was to kind of tone down the cheeriness of the first paragraph.  I have a specific concern with the mortgage rate sentence—if we say that mortgage rates are a big problem, that’s going to signal something about our asset purchase program, I’m afraid, so that’s a concern that I would have. But I do understand the issue about general tone.  Let me just raise this for consideration. The second sentence in alternative B, “Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months, and indicators of consumer and business sentiment have risen,” is obviously a very positive sentence and one that has no parallel in the April statement.  We could, if people like, either strike the sentence entirely, or, perhaps to recognize that there has been general improvement in financial markets, strike the second part about consumer and business sentiment, which would change the tone a bit.  I don’t know if that would satisfy the need. Governor Tarullo mentioned this as well.  Is there any response to that thought.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker mentions that most people were in favor of striking the last sentence, but they believe it is the right decision to keep it. Additionally, there is a concern raised about the mortgage rate sentence potentially signaling something about the asset purchase program.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 356.
 MR. TARULLO. I would find striking the sentence useful.  I think it would balance it a little bit better. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker disagrees with the sentence and believes that striking the sentence would improve the balance of the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 357.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Striking the whole sentence, is everyone okay with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "is everyone okay with that" implies that there may be people who are not okay with striking the whole sentence, indicating potential disagreement among the group.

Passage number 365.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right. Brian will end the sentence after “in recent months” and strike the part about sentiment.  I think that is all that was on the table.  As noted, it is somewhat more upbeat.  It does drop the concern about deflation, although it does say “subdued for some time,” which is a strengthening of what we said last time.  And, of course, it does refer appropriately to the adjustments—the credit and liquidity programs—which will be followed up on Thursday. Any other comments.  If not, Debbie, would you take the roll.

Passage number 366.
 MS. DANKER. Yes. The vote covers the statement that’s in the packet that was handed out today, with two changes.  One is dropping the phrase “and indicators of consumer and business sentiment have risen.”  The other is dropping the bracketed sentence at the bottom. In addition, the vote covers the directive from page 69 of the Bluebook, with one amendment:  That directive had included the sentence stating that the Desk is expected to purchase at least $500 billion in agency MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year.  Given that it is June 24, and they already have purchased $500 billion, that sentence has now been changed to, “The Desk is expected to purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the year.” So it just covers the full year amount.
