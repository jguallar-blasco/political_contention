Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply listing the individuals present at a conference call.


Passage number 2.
 Weber, Senior Research Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisTranscript of the Federal Open Market Committee Conference Call on  June 3, 2009  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We have seen in recent weeks some significant increases in Treasury yields and mortgage rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states a fact about recent increases in Treasury yields and mortgage rates. It does not present any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 3.
 MR. KOHN. Are you going to close the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question with no conflicting viewpoints expressed.


Passage number 4.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I am sorry.  This is a joint FOMC–Board meeting.  I need a motion to close the Board meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a procedural requirement for the meeting to be closed.


Passage number 5.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 6.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Again, we have seen a significant rise in Treasury yields and mortgage rates, and the reason for having the meeting is just to have a bit of interaction, I hope informal, about whether any policy action is worthwhile at this stage, and whether it is or not, if we want to talk at all about how we communicate about this issue.  As usual in an FOMC meeting, we are going to have a presentation from the Desk and an economic outlook update from Dave Stockton.  Before doing that, we have one piece of business, which is to vote to approve the selection of Brian Sack as manager of the SOMA.  Many of you know Brian, I am sure.  He was here. He went off to work with Larry Meyer for a while.  Now we welcome him back to the Fed family.  May I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 7.
 MR. KOHN. So move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context that would suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 8.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Without objection.  All right. Seeing none, the motion is carried. Let me turn now to New York for a report on the Desk.  Brian started yesterday, so I guess we will leave him a little more slack and go to Trish Mosser.  Trish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The phrases "Without objection" and "Seeing none, the motion is carried" indicate that there is agreement among the participants. The reference to leaving Brian "a little more slack" does not suggest disagreement, but rather a flexible approach in consideration of his recent start.


Passage number 9.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very much, Trish.  And thank you for many good reports. Questions for Trish.  Governor Kohn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage consists of expressions of gratitude and appreciation.


Passage number 10.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you. Trish, you noted that foreign yields went up.  Compare the increase in foreign yields with the increase in U.S. yields—I am trying to get a diagnosis here.  Also you said that there were upward revisions to expected Treasury supply in the last couple of weeks, and I wondered what was going on there.  You said that the Treasury said it was concentrating further out the yield curve, so there might be pressure out there.  But have there been upward revisions to budget deficit projections—or why the increase in Treasury supply.  I wasn’t aware of anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for information and clarification on certain points.


Passage number 11.
 MS. MOSSER. This is actually over the whole last month, so it isn’t just the last couple of weeks. It is really since the end of April.  The April tax receipts were substantially below even the Treasury’s estimates, so that has added to supply; and they are revising up the deficit projections a bit. I should have been more precise and said that the Street continues to increase their projections of Treasury supply.  We know that Treasury’s announcements on this are more discreet than that, but the analysts on the Street continue to increase their forecasts.  The Treasury is absolutely pursuing pushing its issuance out the yield curve.  It had shortened up quite substantially the weighted average maturity of the debt, and over the course of this year, it is going to be increasing the maturity of the Treasury debt pretty substantially. Back to your first question about foreign yields, the increase in 10-year yields in the United States is slightly larger than the increases, say, in Germany and Spain.  It is about 10 or 15 basis points larger than, say, in France and the United Kingdom.  Japan is much smaller, only about 15 basis points. But the ranges go from about 15 basis points to about 50 or 60.  The United States is toward the top, but there is no question that yields have gone up everywhere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and stating facts about the increase in Treasury supply and the increase in yields in different countries.


Passage number 12.
 MR. KOHN. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage is a response to a question or statement made by someone (not mentioned in the passage), expressing gratitude for what was said. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage itself.


Passage number 13.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage without more context. The phrase "President Fisher" does not provide enough information to make a judgment on contention or disagreement.


Passage number 14.
 MR. FISHER. Trish, I also want to add my appreciation for the good reports you have been giving, particularly from someone who likes to eat the stuff up, as you know that I do.  I wanted to ask you—going back to Don’s question—we were talking about $2½ trillion for the fiscal year, which gives another trillion or so to run in terms of net new debt issuance.  You mentioned that the Street estimates are going up.  What are they talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 15.
 MS. MOSSER. There is a wide variety of estimates.  I would like to get the Treasury staff here at the Desk to report back to you with the details.  But everyone’s median number keeps getting revised up. I think the range is still between $1 trillion and something over $1½ trillion. But the fact is that all of the increments to everyone’s forecast are positive numbers.  No one is revising things down. But we can get back to you with more details.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is discussing various estimates and the fact that all estimates have been revised upward, indicating positive numbers.


Passage number 16.
 MR. FISHER. How far are we now into the Treasury purchase program of $300 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 17.
 MS. MOSSER. We are almost exactly on schedule, so we are at about $100 billion or maybe a little over $100 billion.  Did I do that right.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Mosser is simply confirming that she has correctly stated the amount as being around $100 billion.


Passage number 18.
 MR. FISHER. Then, my last question is with regard to the TALF.  You said the magic words “exit strategy” when you were giving your monologue.  A general question: In your opinion, has the TALF been effective or marginal in alleviating some of these market pressures. Or has this just happened in conjunction with a general improvement in the marketplace.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question asking for an opinion on the effectiveness of the TALF.


Passage number 19.
 MS. MOSSER. We think the TALF has had an important role to play in the consumer ABS markets in allowing for price discovery.  When a market goes dormant for months on end, it is very difficult for investors and issuers to know what the right price is, particularly when the secondary markets are so illiquid that the prices being quoted there are just so exceptionallyoutside historical experience. The advantage of the TALF providing some financing has been that there is price discovery.  Every time there is new issuance, that new issuance comes in just a little below the previous issuance, and the bid-asked spreads narrow just a bit.  So we think that has actually been its main benefit, frankly, because the sheer size is not huge.  It has been more like a kick-start mechanism for the rest of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply explains the role of the TALF in providing price discovery in the consumer ABS markets.


Passage number 20.
 MR. FISHER. Thank you. And thanks again for your reports.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is simply expressing gratitude and appreciation. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 21.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple expression of gratitude from President Rosengren.


Passage number 22.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Trish, can you talk a bit about the mortgage-backed security ARMs.  In particular, you mentioned that the Desk was going to look at the three-, five-, and seven-year ARMs. So given that the long end has moved up so much, is there anything you are thinking of doing with the mortgage ARMs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren is simply asking Trish for more information about mortgage-backed security ARMs and whether there are any plans for the mortgage ARMs given the changes in the market.


Passage number 23.
 MS. MOSSER. Yes. As a matter of fact, that is one of the topics that we are planning to talk about at the end of the month at the in-person meeting.  We are going to discuss some of the near-term strategy issues with the purchase programs, including some of the changes that we could make.  And ARMs are one of the areas that we, along with the New York and Board staff, are studying.  We will have probably a note for you and, if not a note, certainly a presentation on that topic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. Ms. Mosser is simply stating that the topic of ARMs (Adjustable Rate Mortgages) will be discussed at an upcoming meeting and that it is being studied by the relevant staff.


Passage number 24.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement about President Pianalto.


Passage number 25.
 MS. PIANALTO. Trish, in your report you mentioned the potential downgrade by S&P of some of the CMBS.  How is that going to affect our participation in that program.  Is it going to reduce the number of CMBS that are going to be available for the TALF, and does that change any of our plans for that program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for information and clarification.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 26.
   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I talked to the senior people from S&P this morning about this issue. What is happening is that they are changing their methodology, so the actual credit quality of the CMBS tranches that we are talking about isn’t changing; it is really that they are changing how they characterize them.  And we are going to have to make a decision, frankly.  If their characterization is way outside what we think is appropriate, we may want to modify our criteria. For example, let’s imagine a situation in which there are five rating agencies, and four rank a given tranche triple-A, and S&P is the outlier.  If we really judge that the outlier is inappropriate—in other words, that there isn’t a lot of credit risk associated with that tranche— we might want to change our criteria to allow one exception among the credit-rating agencies.  So that is something that we are going to have to evaluate.  We are going to have to see what they do and then (1) evaluate what that means for the size of the eligible market and (2) consider what it means, if we modified the criteria, in terms of what sort of credit risk we would be actually taking. So we are going to have to wait and see what they actually do in terms of what the impact is and then feed that into what is appropriate for the program.  But it is not a change in their perception of the actual underlying credit quality; it is how they are characterizing that credit quality because they are changing their methodology.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The author discusses the possibility of modifying their criteria if the characterization by S&P is significantly different from their own perception. They suggest that S&P may be an outlier in their characterization of a tranche's credit risk. This indicates disagreement or conflict in perspectives on how to assess credit quality.


Passage number 27.
 MS. MOSSER. That is true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states a fact ("That is true") and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 28.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I just want to say, to be clear, that we have not made any changes. We are maintaining the triple-A requirement.  So if we don’t make changes, that would eliminate close to half—or something like that—of the eligible assets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact or providing clarification about the situation.


Passage number 29.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. My point is that I think we just want to make sure that we control our own destiny. It may be completely appropriate for S&P to do these downgrades, and we may feel completely comfortable with that.  We may want to rule out all of those tranches. I am just saying that it is possible that we may view them as such outliers in terms of their assessment of credit quality that we may not want to give full weight to it.  So you are absolutely correct:  We haven’t changed our policy, and we haven’t committed to changing our policy. But we might want to reevaluate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is sharing their thoughts and considerations but explicitly states that they have not yet made any commitments or changes to their policy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 30.
   MS. MOSSER. One other notable difference is that with TALF 2.0 we have been fairly clear in the information we have released to the public that we are going to do much more credit analysis ourselves and we are going to hire a collateral evaluation agent to give us an independent, security-by-security evaluation of the quality of the collateral.  One of the reasons for that was, frankly, concern among the team working on the TALF that we might run into a situation like this, where there were potentially significant disagreements across the rating agencies, and we really do want to have more control of our destiny, as Bill calls it.  So no decisions at all have been made, and this is one of the things that the team is working on very actively.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is indicated by the phrase "frankly, concern among the team working on the TALF that we might run into a situation like this, where there were potentially significant disagreements across the rating agencies." This suggests that there were differing opinions or disagreements within the team about the potential impact of disagreements across rating agencies.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 31.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Another whole issue about the question of credit rating is that, when you are talking about a new securitization selling at par, the ratings are comparable across different assets, but when you are talking about a legacy security, where the security might be selling at a very big discount to par, it is not really clear how that price and rating map into actual credit risk. In other words, if I could buy a double-A-rated CMBS that is selling at 5 cents on the dollar and then I am haircutting it on top of that, the risk I am taking is probably de minimis.  So it is very important to recognize that there is a whole second set of complications when you are talking about legacy securities because a lot of these securities are not selling at par. They are selling at deep discounts to par, so a lot of the risk is already embodied in that price. But the rating agencies don’t think of it that way.  They are rating it as if it were an instrument trading at par, and the risk of taking actually any losses whatsoever on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The author contends that rating agencies do not consider the deep discounts at which legacy securities are sold, while the ratings are based on the assumption that the securities are trading at par.


Passage number 32.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you. President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It consists of polite acknowledgments and gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 33.
 MR. BULLARD. Yes, a question for Bill Dudley.  Wouldn’t the other rating agencies follow suit and then change their methodology eventually, so the idea of having just one outlier maybe isn’t that realistic over a medium term.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the phrase "so the idea of having just one outlier maybe isn't that realistic over a medium term." The speaker is suggesting that having just one outlier (in terms of rating agencies) is not a realistic expectation over a medium term, implying disagreement with the idea presented earlier.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 34.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. That is certainly possible.  I think that, in our conversations with the different rating agencies, we have felt the least comfortable that S&P was up to snuff in how they rate the commercial mortgage products.  So you are absolutely right. Everyone could converge to S&P’s new standard—or maybe not.  But at the end of the day, what we really have to think about is that this shouldn’t be driven by one rating agency.  It should be driven by what we are trying to do with the program and what is an acceptable level of credit risk to us. Now, obviously, the acceptable level of credit risk to us is de minimis.  So I am not suggesting that we are going to be widening the program to take on a lot more risk, but I don’t think we want to absolutely pre-commit ourselves to go wherever S&P drives the bus.  That’s all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses discomfort with how S&P rates commercial mortgage products and states that the program should not be solely driven by one rating agency. They also mention not wanting to pre-commit to following S&P's lead. This suggests a disagreement or contention between the speaker and S&P's rating methods.


Passage number 35.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The staff will keep working on these issues, and we will see where that goes. Anyone else, questions for Trish.  Not seeing anybody, I turn now to Dave Stockton for a brief update on the outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply mentions that the staff will continue working on the mentioned issues and then moves on to inquire if anyone else has questions for Trish.


Passage number 36.
 MR. STOCKTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The bottom line is that the  forecast has strengthened somewhat further since the April Greenbook.  The  incoming data have been a little stronger than we were looking for, and there has  been, on net, some continued improvement in the key factors conditioning our  forecast. In the near term, the main qualitative features of the story that we have been  telling for some time continue to receive support from the incoming data.   Consumption looks as though it has flattened out in the first half after declining very  steeply late last year. Housing looks to be stabilizing.  Businesses are continuing to  slash production and by enough to achieve some sizable liquidations of excess  inventories. And we are still seeing capital spending decline at a pretty rapid clip.  There have been a few surprises in the data, and most of them have been to the upside. In the first quarter, with imports declining much more rapidly than exports, the contribution of net exports to GDP was larger than we had expected.  And in the second quarter, we have received somewhat stronger, or maybe I should say less weak, readings on housing, equipment spending, and nonresidential construction.  On that last factor, we received two months now of data on construction put in place that were much stronger than we had expected.  Those surprises have been concentrated in power generation and refinery construction.  We checked with the Census Bureau, and it stands by its data. But I think I can say with some confidence that we are not looking for refinery construction to be the engine of growth to propel us out of recession here.  So we are not really attaching much signal going forward to any of the strength in this nonresidential construction, where we still see the fundamentals as pretty terrible. As was the case at the April meeting, we are still not seeing any signs of appreciable improvement yet in labor markets.  And I would say that the readings on the labor market, if anything, have been a bit worse than we were anticipating.  Initial claims have flattened out some in recent weeks, but at very high levels.  And insured unemployment has continued to soar.  In fact, those data led us to mark down further our near-term labor forecast, and we are expecting this Friday’s May employment report to show a drop in private payrolls of a bit more than 500,000.  I expect that that figure would be pretty close to the ADP estimate but would be 100,000 weaker than our forecast at the April meeting.  And given the increase in insured unemployment, we are also expecting the unemployment rate in May to increase to 9¼ percent, and that is about ¼ percentage point higher than we had in our previous projection.  Putting together the spending data, what we see in the labor market, and what we know about production, we are now estimating that real GDP declined at an annual rate of about 5½ percent in the first quarter and at about a 1 percent rate in the second quarter. Both of those figures are about ½ percentage point stronger than our April projection. It is still the case, looking further ahead, that we think that the contraction in activity that we have experienced in the first half is going to give way to, first, a stabilization and then a modest upturn in activity in the second half.  That is predicated on the expectation, which we are seeing supported in the data at this point, that final demands more broadly are going to be stabilizing in the second half, supported by fiscal stimulus and the easing that has occurred in financial conditions. And we continue to expect some lessening in the pace of inventory liquidation going forward as stocks move into better alignment with sales, and that ought to provide a boost to production as well in the second half. As I mentioned at the outset, the key factors conditioning the longer-term forecast have shown further improvement and would lead us to revise up the projection later this year and in 2010. Stock prices are about 10 percent higher than was anticipated at the time of our April forecast, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar is down about 5 percent relative to our previous projection.  As for interest rates, the backup in mortgage interest rates certainly would hold back housing some, but the quantitative effect of that increase would be offset by the decline in corporate rates that we are seeing and the decline in the corporate cost of capital.  So on net, the higher stock market and the lower dollar would provide some significant impetus.  That is offset only a bit by the higher oil prices, which are more than $10 a barrel higher across the forecast period. In combination with the stronger incoming data for the first half, the net effect of these changes in the conditioning assumptions would add about ½ percentage point to the growth in GDP in both 2009 and 2010.  That would put us at about minus 1 percent this year and about plus 3 percent in 2010.  As for our projection for the unemployment rate, as I noted earlier, despite the stronger spending data, the labor market is looking weaker to us.  As a consequence, we now expect the unemployment rate to top out later this year at somewhat above 9½ percent. But then given the stronger outlook for real GDP growth over the next year and a half, we project a larger decline in the unemployment rate from that higher level, so that we would probably have a forecast of an unemployment rate a bit below 9 percent by the end of 2010, in contrast to our April forecast, which had it ending at a bit above 9 percent. Our inflation projection will likely be revised up a bit.  The incoming data on core consumer prices have been somewhat higher than we expected, but almost all of that surprise has been tobacco price increases that we just do not expect to persist.  Still, we are working with higher energy prices and a lower dollar that is likely to put some upward pressure on import prices.  Those are going to combine to provide a small boost, all else being equal, to core prices in both 2009 and 2010 of about a tenth or so.  Obviously this year is going to get some further boost in terms of total PCE prices of about ½ percentage point from higher energy prices and a bit higher core prices.  I will be happy to take questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 37.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, David, for this intermeeting report.  Questions for Dave. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing gratitude to David for providing an intermeeting report, followed by the statement that there are questions for Dave.


Passage number 38.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. David, where would you put the unconstrained equilibrium federal funds rate today compared with, say, the April meeting and earlier in the year.  And roughly how much of that is driven just by the forecast turning out differently than we expected versus how much of that is due to the easing in financial conditions that we’ve seen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply asking for David's opinion on the current state of the unconstrained equilibrium federal funds rate and the factors that have influenced it. There is no disagreement or contention indicated.


Passage number 39.
   MR. STOCKTON. Vice Chairman, we haven’t done that calculation yet.  We’re just getting started. But we would be happy to do that and get it to the Committee as soon as we get a little better fix on tying down the forecast at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating that they have not yet calculated something and they are willing to provide the information once they have a better understanding of the forecast.


Passage number 40.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The word "okay" is an indication of agreement or acknowledgment.


Passage number 41.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any specific questions or statements that would indicate contention or disagreement. It simply states "Other questions" followed by the mention of President Lockhart without any indication of conflicting ideas or opposing views.


Passage number 42.
 MR. LOCKHART. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Dave, on the question of risks to your outlook, there has been a lot of discussion of commercial real estate.  Can you give some sense of how you would quantify any risk to the outlook associated with worse-than-expected problems in the commercial real estate sector.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a request for information and does not involve conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 43.
 MR. STOCKTON. Luckily that sector is a small enough share of total GDP that, even with an appreciable error on our part to the downside, there would not be a whole lot of direct effect on GDP. Nevertheless, it is still the case that the fundamentals there look extremely soft, and aside from the power generation and refinery surprises that we have had, the rest of commercial real estate is coming pretty close to our expectations in the forecast.  It is easy to see how we could have a sharper decline there than we have built into the forecast.  But I do not think we would be looking at something that did more than affect the top-line GDP by a tenth or two, even if we were to see a more significant decline.  Now, whether or not there would be feedback effects through the financial system of a continued deterioration in commercial real estate and sharper price declines there, I think that would probably be the bigger concern.  And if I were more concerned about the downside risk to the outlook, I would look for effects probably coming through that channel rather than through the direct construction channel alone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the potential impact of a decline in the commercial real estate sector on the overall GDP and potential feedback effects through the financial system.


Passage number 44.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions. Okay. Let me make just a couple of comments about the situation, and then we’ll open it up for any questions or comments that participants may have.  Looking at the increase in yields, it is not an entirely benign development, obviously.  There is the undercurrent of huge deficits, and on a few specific days, like the day on which the United Kingdom got the warning, we saw a bad combination of movements:  a decline in the dollar, a rise in yields, and a fall in equity prices, which is sort of indicative of a flight from U.S. debt.  So a couple of days like that were somewhat worrisome. Having said that, my own view—and I will want to hear views of others and from the staff—is that most of what we have seen since the FOMC meeting is the result of more-positive influences, notably, first, the better outlook, which has caused the term premium to increase or the yield curve to steepen, and second, the reversal in the flight to quality.  We are seeing the dollar decline and the yields rise at the same time that equity prices go up, which suggests a more positive interpretation of the development.  It is not clear what role inflation expectations are playing. It is certainly true that, mechanically, a significant part of the increase is tied to the increase in 5- to 10-year breakevens. But whether that is really a change in inflation expectations arising, say, from reduced fear of deflation or whether it’s just better operation and more liquidity in the TIPS market is not entirely clear.  But either one, I think, is not particularly worrisome because the breakevens now suggest a still well-controlled rate of inflation, pretty close to what our target would be.  So I guess my overall assessment is that, although we need to watch carefully in terms of the risks associated with flight from the dollar or flight from Treasuries, that this is mostly a benign development.  Based on that, if I were recommending at this point, I would not recommend any change in our policy.  To the extent that this increase in yields is being driven by a better outlook that is an endogenous part of the improvement of the economy, I think our best approach there would just be to wait and watch and see how things go.   I would also mention, as I did in my note to the Committee earlier, that I think that June’s meeting is going to be very informative.  We have presentations in June on a wide variety of aspects of our program, including the effects of large-scale asset purchases; as Trish mentioned, the tactics of making purchases; the exit strategy both from individual programs and from the balance sheet; and managing the balance sheet more broadly.  So I personally would think that we would want to wait and hear more about those issues, particularly the exit strategy, before making any changes in our programs. On communication, my suggestion would be, to the extent that you agree that this is primarily a benign development, that we communicate that we are comfortable, that we are taking a wait-and-see approach, and that we will just review as necessary our policies as the data come in.  That would be the summary of my own view at this point, but if others disagree or want to amplify, I certainly would be happy and interested to hear that.  So are there any questions or comments.  President Lacker.

Passage number 45.
 MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I did suggest that this be a formal FOMC meeting to you in conversation last Friday.  I did this for three reasons.  One, to make sure we would be able to elect Brian Sack as soon as possible.  Second, the staff noted that the change in the monetary base projections or the balance sheet or however you look at it was going to be substantially different from what they had told us they would expect, given our plans coming out of the last meeting.  And I think in light of our uncertainty about just how transmission mechanisms are working right now, a little consultation was warranted even if one’s expectation coming into this might not be that recalibrating or recrafting our plans was warranted.  My own sense—I agree with you, Mr. Chairman—is that we shouldn’t alter our purchase programs right now. Maybe we view that as warranted at the next meeting, but I do not at this meeting want to suggest that we ought to change our purchase programs, even though the trajectory for the balance sheet seems significantly lower.  The third reason I wanted to suggest that this would be a fruitful discussion had to do with the Treasury market selloffs that occurred over the last couple of weeks, which you alluded to and Trish Mosser and others have talked about.  One notable feature of those selloffs is that they at times were accompanied by substantial market chatter about the possibility that we might intervene or increase our purchase programs in order to limit yield increases. Now, this highlights for me a communication challenge that I think we are likely to face several times again.  We have embarked on an asset-purchase program of a certain size, and we didn’t discuss much how program size could or would or should or ought to vary with circumstances.  Even though there is language in the directive that says it ought to vary with circumstances, we didn’t really talk about the way in which it ought to change with evolving circumstances.  That language is in the directive.  So you can see how the private sector might have been encouraged to think that, if we get surprised by something, we might react by changing our purchase programs.  I think that market participants believe about our programs that we want to lower borrowing costs and to lower them in particular markets like mortgages, credit cards, or auto loans. And that connection, which I think has been made in a lot of market participants’ minds, would lead naturally to the supposition that we want to reduce yields on things like Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.  From there it is just a short step to the notion that we might react to unexpected increases in yields with an expansion of our purchase program. But as you pointed out, Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of reasons that yields could increase in ways that wouldn’t imply that we would have a motive to increase purchases.  In fact, some of   these reasons, if anything, would imply that we might want to consider backing off or reducing the scale of our purchases. Better growth prospects, for example, indicate perhaps a reduced need for stimulus. Higher expected inflation or reduced probability attached to the possibility of deflation would seem to suggest reduced stimulus.  Higher federal deficits—again, if we were to increase our purchases, that would amount to sort of monetizing the debt.  Or if we were to try to offset the effect of higher deficits on yields, that would amount essentially to monetizing some of the debt, which would be inflationary. I do not think we want to do that. To my mind, this arises in part because of the degree to which we have emphasized the asset side of our balance sheet rather than the liability side.  The way I have communicated about our stimulus and our asset purchases is to refer to them generally in terms of the overall stimulus that the programs are supplying.  So in the weeks ahead and maybe even the months ahead, when we get to episodes in which yields change in an unexpected way and people are talking about how we are going to react, my own view is that articulating this in terms of the overall stimulus we are providing and de-emphasizing borrowing costs and interest rates in particular market segments might be useful.  In addition, sort of in conjunction with that, it might be useful to emphasize other developments that could be affecting yields for plausible reasons that would obviously not warrant an increase in stimulus—improving credit market conditions, reduced downside risks to inflation, and so on. So those are just the remarks I have, but again, it was out of a concern that recent market events and commentary on them seemed to indicate some uncertainty and confusion about our potential reaction function—in this case, thinking of our reaction function as being asset purchases as a function of incoming information, like yields.  I was just struck by the extent to which markets put some probability on the notion that we might increase the scale of our   intervention to try to damp the increase in yields, which I think in this case would be pretty clearly the wrong thing to do.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, agrees with the Chairman that the purchase programs should not be altered at this time, despite the lower trajectory for the balance sheet. He also highlights the communication challenge faced by the Federal Reserve in regards to market expectations and emphasizes the need to articulate the overall stimulus provided by the programs rather than focusing on borrowing costs and interest rates.
