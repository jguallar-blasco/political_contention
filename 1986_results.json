{"1986FOMC19860212meeting.txt": ["MR. RICE. Sam, are there any other explanations that youknow about, other than the [reaction to] statements of foreign centralbank and government officials, to explain the movement in the exchangerate after the lowering of the discount rate in Japan. As you said,after the Japanese lowered the discount rate and their interest ratesgenerally moved down, the dollar weakened further and the yen went up.I gather, as you said, that the explanation related to the statementsof government officials. But was there anything other than that", "MR. KICHLINE. Right, I think that's an important feature.And that's very different from the last four or five years, as youknow, with current services estimates shown to grow substantially intothe $300 billion plus range five years out. We do not have all of thedetails available on the CBO estimates. I must say that one mightassume that there is some agreement on what current services estimatesmean but that turns out to be very wrong. This year is a classiccase. For example, the Administration's current services numberassumes that the defense baseline is 3 percent real growth. Well,after the Gramm-Rudman March 1 cuts, they jump up spending but assumethat the spend out rate is very slow. CBO assumes that noCongressional action is zero real growth, but recent experience hasdefense spending much faster than the Administration [assumption].The net result is that in 1991 there is a mere $35 billion[difference] between the two on defense alone, but there areoffsetting changes. Interest rates are different; they are worth $20to $25 billion. Inflation rates are substantially different, with the2/11-12/86Administration having inflation drifting down to 2 percent in 1991 andhence indexed programs grow at the much slower rate; under the currentservices estimates, that's worth something on the order of $25 billionor so by 1991. So, if you want to mix and match all of these thingsin your own way, instead of 1991 numbers that drift down essentiallyto $100 to $110 billion without further action you probably could haveanything from $50 to $200 billion and be perfectly consistent with allof these numbers. The problem, I think, is that there is a great dealof emphasis on the notion that it's very different even withoutfurther action--that the budget will be improving--and I think that'sprobably faulty. Hidden behind this, there's a lot more going on", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Jim, on chart 21 where you talkedabout the impact of lower oil prices, it seems to me that the patternof effects is a little puzzling. Wouldn't one expect, for example,that the impact of lower oil prices on real GNP would be felt more in1987 than 1986--that it takes time for these oil prices to work theirway through in terms of increased income for people to spend and lowercosts for corporations to increase their spending. I would say thesame thing, but maybe with not quite the same lag, about the deflator.It isn't only the direct effect of lower oil prices on inflation;there are many indirect impacts that probably would show up more in1987 than in 1986", "MR. TRUMAN. Not entirely; that's the problem. A largefraction of it has been shifted--or will be shifted in the context ofthis arrangement--at the bank's option. Many of the European bankshave switched back into their own currencies", "MR. KICHLINE. No, you have to cumulate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we don't have any more specificquestions, we're at the point where people can express their opinionsabout the general economic situation. With the wide range of opinionsin what was distributed, I am sure we will have a lively discussion", "MR. WALLICH. How long has the [economy been growing] at thissteady rate of 3-1/2 percent--maybe four years", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. As far as the forecast goes, my ownforecast is a shade stronger in real terms than the staff's forecast--3.4 percent versus their 3 percent. As best as I can recall, there isno one difference that accounts for that--just a bit here and thereacross the board. My inflation number is also a little stronger,although I might be inclined to shade that down at least a little,simply because the oil price has fallen further--and I think is likelyto [move down] further--than I would have guessed 10 days ago orwhenever that forecast was made.As I said a month or six weeks ago, we can play around withthese forecasts until the cows come home but I think there is avariety of factors that transcend the forecast, which Mike and Jim andTed referred to in various parts of their commentaries. On theexchange rate side, for example, we have seen something that smells tome like a basic change in market attitudes towards the dollar, partlybecause of some of the official announcements and all the rest. Ithink that has been reinforced by the combination of the oil pricesituation and perceptions as to how that will affect the LDCs, and inturn how that in combination with some of the other problems that areperceived at least to be there in the banking system will affect [thesituation]. I think those considerations, at least at the margin, dohave a decided influence on the attitudes toward the dollar right now.So, I view the dollar as not only lower by 5 to 7 percent from when welast met but I guess I consider it a good deal more vulnerable on thedown side than it was six weeks or so ago. What will happen to theoil price is anybody's guess. It could stabilize in the $18 to $20range; it could go down further; or, if the Saudis are able to reach ameeting of the minds with the British or somebody else, the problem isthat it could go up--particularly if it got down to, say, the $15 or$13 range. In some ways the worst of all worlds is to have the oilprice go down that low only to come back up, even if it only came backup to $22 or so. I don't think one can rule that possibility out.How that will play out is an enormous uncertainty; but almostregardless of how it will play out, I think it has caused the LDC-10-2/11-12/86situation to deteriorate significantly. Mexico's problems are clear;to me the great danger is if Mexico gets so out of control that itforces other things to become unglued a bit. So, I think thatsituation is also a good deal more tender, to put it mildly.I remain concerned about this whole debt issue, which again,Jim and Mike touched on. I don't see it getting much better. If Ilook at Mike's flow-of-funds forecast for 1986--and I know how hard itis to forecast the flow of funds--in an underlying sense I don't seeanything that constitutes a real improvement there, particularly whenyou take account of the special blip in state and local borrowing atthe end of this past year growing out of tax considerations.On the inflation side, I guess I am a little more concerned.I think the probabilities lie on the side of an inflation rate thatlooks like the ones that are more or less represented in the forecastin front of us. But it is not hard for me to see how the inflationpicture could be worse, notwithstanding the oil prices. Productivityis lousy. I don't see that getting any better. The exchange rate hasalready come down 20 to 25 percent. I don't see any hard evidence ofany feedthrough on prices coming from that, though I don't rule itout. I don't know what the natural unemployment rate is either. Somepeople say 6 percent; it might be higher than that. The fact of thematter is that, looked at it in that light, the unemployment rateisn't all that far from the point where it could put some pressure onthe price level. Beyond that, just in a behavioral sense, the kind ofunit labor cost/price behavior relationships that are in the staff'sforecast and my own basically have profit margins sitting still in acontext in which it is very clear to me that businesses are going tograsp at every straw they can find to try and raise prices. So whileI agree with the price forecasts that are on the table, especially inthe context of the oil price situation, I must say that I do have someconcern that by the latter part of the year we could get anunfortunate surprise on inflation", "MR. MARTIN. I appreciate the timing of my turn, getting todebate with my friend, Bob Black. It seems to me that the indicationsfor future prices are quite the other way. I see no turnaround in thecommodity price situation around the globe. It seems to me that therestill will be almost a dumping behavior and that in some cases theLDCs will be [induced] in various situations by oil price declines andnecessity to dump something else into the markets. In terms of theoil price change, I think it is more fundamental; I respectfullydiffer with you in that regard. I consider the faint possibility thatsome day the Iranians and the Iraqis will stop the killing of eachother and there will be an augmented supply from that part of theworld. It seems to me that gluts beget shortages down the road, butit takes many years. We have experience from the two oil shocks thatwe have been through and now we are in a glut situation. I believethe inflation outlook is positive from those points of view.I don't know, Jerry, about productivity; I am as puzzled asanybody else. I certainly missed forecasting that over a period oftime, but I don't share your negative approach to productivity. Itseems to me that we have yet to realize our trend rate of growth. Ithink 3 percent is too low a guess with regard to potential GNP; thegap could be a couple of hundred basis points that we are fallingshort by. And I am not comfortable with the staff's projections ofexport growth. There is a table in the Greenbook in current dollarsthat shows an increase--I don't remember the percentage anymore andI've scratched over it once--of about 25 or 30 percent in fivequarters. I don't think we are going to make that for the veryreasons that this special report detailed. I won't take the time ofthis rather large Committee but you may remember the 7 or 8 pointsmade in that report, which added up to a delay of the impact: thelong-term contracts, fixed investments, special factors and so forth,that we all read in that report. I don't think we are going to beable to take market share back; I try to [unintelligible] myexperience with Sears World Trade, which goes back a few years, but Ijust don't see our being able to compete in the manufacturing areawith the Koreans and others around the globe. I don't think we aregoing to get that share back, and I think we still are going to bestruggling with the difficulties of competing with imports.I think the fiscal drag situation is spelled out very nicelyin two of the line diagrams in the staff's presentations: we'reswinging from a growth in real federal purchases of about 12 percentin 1985 to a decline of almost 8 percent in 1986--and then you add onto that state and local government, as the chart graphicallydisplayed. Will that be offset by some of the more positive factorsthat have already been reviewed. I suppose it will, but I don't thinkwe are going to get rates of growth of 4 percent past the first2/11-12/86quarter. I go along with Frank Morris' estimate of something morelike 3 percent. When the Chairman polled us not too many months agoas to what we thought about 3 percent growth, I said it's inadequate.It is particularly inadequate when you think of the debt that we haveto service in this country; every sector is this country has a hugedebt. Add to that the less developed country situation and theGermans and Japanese headed for a 1 to 2 percent inflation posture.It seems to me that if we are erring in any direction interms of the economy, it is that we are understressing the risk ofeven more inadequate growth after the first quarter. The firstquarter is fine; but once again we are all so impressed with twomonths' data, not all of which were positive, yet we are talking aboutmonetary policy that is going to impact the third and fourth quartersof this year and the first quarter of next year. The first quarter ofnext year will be the fifth year of expansion, as Governor Wallich hasalready reminded us. It is a pretty old expansion. Whether or not itis obvious where the structural imbalances are, we know they are builtin there. Goodness knows we have had enough changes in the economysector by sector, as Karen pointed out, and in industry by industry--in manufacturing, the thrifts, nonresidential construction and soforth. I don't think we are going to achieve the numbers that are inthe Greenbook for business fixed investment. Looking at the fourthquarter and all the shipments and contracts on Sierra--well, IBM is afine institution and all that, but you can certainly get distorteddata from one quarter's move there. I don't think we are going tohave big upswings in business fixed investment and nondefense durablegoods orders. The Defense Department finally seems to be waking up alittle with regard to what they are about over there. It just seemsto me that the risks are on the down side and that we have anopportunity here because there is some disinflation in the totality.We have an opportunity to look at monetary policy with a little moreaction space than in a different economic situation", "MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, our forecast is marginallydifferent from the Board staff's forecast both with respect to growthand inflation. We think that growth in 1986 is going to be somewhathigher, about 0.3 of a percentage point. It is not in any particulararea but pretty much across the board. On the inflation side, wethink inflation is going to be a little higher than the Board staff'sforecast. I am not really as convinced about that personally as mystaff is, but what is driving that forecast of higher inflationbasically is the unemployment numbers, which would seem to point topressure on wages and prices later in 1986. And that combined withlower productivity would certainly indicate a higher inflation rate.The effect of the lower dollar and the drop in the oil pricesobviously work in different directions in terms of the effect oninflation, if you leave out the timing question. I don't know howthat washes out; maybe those two factors tend to net out to not toomuch effect on inflation. But one thing that I am concerned aboutfrom time to time is the drop in the dollar in terms of our trade-weighted index, which is pretty well weighted toward the Europeancountries. Obviously, the drop of the dollar doesn't affect tradewith some of our other trading partners, particularly Canada, wherethe dollar actually has appreciated", "MR. KEEHN. Yes", "MR. GUFFEY. Yes. As a matter of fact, one or two of thoseopen pit mines up in Wyoming actually closed because of [falling]demand. There is one being opened momentarily, but they don't thinkthey can go on into production", "MS. SEGER. One nice thing about being last is that so muchof what I was thinking has already been stated; but I will just make acouple of points. One is that my forecast for this year's real GNPgrowth is a touch below the staff's. The main reason is that,although I would like to see exports respond very rapidly to thedeteriorating dollar, I am not convinced that they will. Also, Iwould like to think that imports would respond negatively to thedeteriorating dollar but, unfortunately, I am not convinced that thatis going to happen either. So, I don't think that we are going tohave net exports contribute as much this year as our staff numberssuggest. Also, I am a little more negative about plant and equipmentspending. I am concerned that questions about tax reform and what theproposals will do to business tax bills will discourage a lot ofinvestment of that type; as long as those proposals are out there andas long as they look as negative as they do, that's going to happen.So, those are the two places where my numbers deviate from thestaff's. On the inflation side, I am a little more encouraged aboutthe impact of the deteriorating dollar on inflation. I just don't seethese higher prices being passed through quickly. I am very convincedthat the foreign competition, having gotten their toe or foot or wholebody in this market, rather love it here, and I think that they aregoing to want to maintain market share and are not going to dothemselves in through hasty price adjustments. That's what my sensetells me; I hope it's not just wishful thinking", "MR. ANGELL. With that kind of projection on interest rates,then, I guess my forecast wouldn't be so different from yours. I mustadmit that I made my forecast based upon a continuation of the presentlevel of interest rates. If we get that kind of movement in interestrates, the timing of that certainly would have something to do withwhat the forecast might be. I admit to having probably the lowestinflation prediction of anyone here; I'll claim the 2-1/2 percentinflation number. I don't mind doing that because I've been aroundeconomists for some time and they all told me how inflation was goingto be higher than it turned out to be; so I don't mind having been onthe right side of this issue for the last five years and continuing tobe on that same side.I think Governor Seger is correct in analyzing the foreignsector in regard to the competitive level there. Their economies arevery price and wage flexible and, consequently, they are going to takethe steps necessary to continue, or maybe to add to, their position inour markets. But the impact of the deflationary environment iscertainly there, and I just don't see any signs of any change ininflation psychology. Now, I see the expectations there; but if theinflation expectation remains above the actual rate of inflation itseems to me that we are going to see that in such areas asinventories. The forecast of the inventory accumulation that mightoccur is not going to be very plausible if the actual rate ofinflation is lower than the anticipated rate. In the area of oils andchemicals and farm products, it seems to me that with the decliningprice scenario one would want to hold fewer inventories, not moreinventories. So I have some questions in that regard.I am also somewhat hesitant to believe that equipment isgoing to do as well in this kind of environment as some might expect,but that might be influenced in part by my own perspective in regardto equipment in the farm sector. I don't know when John Deere hastheir wage negotiations, but they probably coincide with the autoindustry and it seems to me that they are a long way from re-enteringthat market. My last comment is in regard to the natural rate ofunemployment. I don't know what it is, by the way; but whatever itis, it seems to me that it's falling faster than unemployment isfalling. In fact, it may be dragging the unemployment rate down sothat any margins that we had are still there. I do not see any wagenegotiations that indicate we are getting closer to the natural rateof unemployment than we were", "MR. MELZER. I decided not to go last today. One otheraspect of M1 that I would mention is that it bears the closestrelationship to what we do, and for that reason I think it's importantto maintain it as a target and not just as a monitoring range. Also,as I expressed yesterday, I tend to be among those who are moreconcerned about possible inflationary developments--what Steve citedin the first instance. And in that context it may be desirable tohave M1 as a target. If we find ourselves in a position where wemight have to exercise a greater degree of restraint during the courseof the year, an M1 target could add to that argument. At the sametime, I recognize the uncertainties about the behavior of velocity andfor that reason I could be persuaded to expand the band at the upperend somewhat. I don't think there would be adverse market reactionsto that. In fact, if we found ourselves in a position where wecontinued to have very aberrant behavior of velocity, we could dealwith that in the same fashion we did [last] year without losing atremendous amount of credibility. In any case, I do think it'sdesirable to have the M1 target. I could settle for a 4 to 7 percentrange, although I think the chances are that we would be running nearthe upper end of that. I wouldn't mind providing more room. In fact,it might be inappropriate to shoot for, say, the middle of the 4 to 7percent range, given the rate of money growth we had in 1985; but I dothink we ought to lean toward slowing that down and, under certaincircumstances, I wouldn't necessarily rule out aiming for the lowerpart of a 4 to 8 percent range--if other factors led us in thatdirection", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me if there's one termthat applies to the difficult forecasts that were so well done by the-30-2/11-12/86Board's staff and so widely supported yesterday, it is \"uncertainty.\"We do face a degree of uncertainty that even for a forward-lookinggroup of economists is notable. It seems to me that this isepitomized by a comment on page 6 below the alternatives for the longrun as we futilely define it here: the reference to the substantialportion of the rapid demand deposit growth of last year, which isunexplained by any concept of interest elasticity. Of course, wecould experience that again this year. I join President Corrigan inthe expectation of not putting a great deal of weight on it, butexpecting that we probably won't have that continued growth. But wedon't understand it. And if there are difficulties in the Southwestand in some of the oil-exporting developing countries, certainly thatphenomenon or something like it could return. But we don't understandthe very interest elasticity that now characterizes M1, or at leastcomponents thereof. Therefore, adding these two factors together, Iwould favor a 3 to 8 percent range around M1 to give the Committeeflexibility and to reflect the uncertainty generally--not just thedemand deposit uncertainty, but our lack of ability to forecast Mlright now in this context. I would not favor taking the 1984approach, though, of putting M1 too deeply out of the show because Ido feel that the money managers in banks will learn reasonablyshortly--the market is going to force them to learn--how to pricevarious instruments and what the interest elasticity in theirsubmarkets is. That aspect of the interest elasticity, in theinstitutional sense, will tend to be more understandable over time, Ithink.So, I would favor keeping M1 in the pantheon, widening therange because of the uncertainty with regard to velocity and otheraspects of it, and giving us the flexibility in implementing policy todeal with the unexpected. Think of the unexpecteds we have before usright now. In the last 10 hours the flow of news [has included] that:the Conference Board's consumer confidence index is down; MinisterTakeshita again is hinting about a further discount rate cut by theJapanese; and of all things, IBM is substantially cutting the price ofits brand new CPU mainframes just as their deliveries are takingplace. I think we really have to expect the unexpected. We need wideranges. With regard to President Corrigan's comment about thelanguage, Mr. Chairman, I would like to see symmetrical languageindicating that if economic growth falters very substantially--and Ithink there is a real risk of that occurring--we would be prepared toadjust even our targets but certainly the way in which we implementour monetary policy, regardless of what aggregate or aggregates wewere focusing on. I think Steve's comment about the triumvirate isimpressive. And I would join Frank Morris in wondering why we stillcite the debt [aggregate], which we can't control. We can affect thatonly marginally; there's no way to hit any kind of target or any kindof monitoring number on the debt range", " You go up against them--MR. PRELL. It depends on how you do the accounting. Ourrough estimate is that the impact of the accelerated financingactivity last year that was attributable to the concerns about taxreform would tack on roughly a percentage point. If you wanted toinclude all advance refunding activity, much of which was stimulatedsimply by the fact that interest rates were lower or by othertechnical considerations, that would move in the direction thatPresident Morris was talking about and you would get a slightly largerfigure; it might move toward 1-1/2 percentage point", "MR. PRELL. Well, yes; I think there's no end to this. Andthat's the problem, ultimately, in having an adjusted measure. Allsectors of the economy tend to borrow and build up assets at the sametime. Sometimes we can identify special financial strategies that arepeculiar, like advance refundings or seasonal debt by corporations,where if we had the data we could chop those amounts off. But the2/11-12/86fact is that homeowners may borrow more than they need to when buyinga home and use that extra cash to build up their liquid assets. So ifyou start taking all these things out, you get down to fundamentalsectoral balances which you really can't identify with growth of adebt aggregate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I could argue it the other way. I justargued against not keeping it. One could argue that these numbers areso high anyway that we can comment on the excessiveness of it withouthaving that benchmark. So, I guess you could argue it either way;it's not all that critical. On the M1 range, I'm not arguingsubstance here but I just want to make sure we really think aboutwhether we would be ahead of the game or behind the game by changingthe upper limit. We are going to have some language in here--languagethat we may want to take a little time to play with--indicating thatwe are not going to be locked into this Ml figure, depending upon alot of other developments. Given that kind of language which is notyet defined, unfortunately, if we change the range I think there is atleast a risk of it getting read as if 8-1/2 percent, let's say, reallyis bad. To make my case in extreme form--I'll make my case but Idon't feel all that strongly: Suppose M1 were running at 9 percent andall things considered we didn't want to do anything about it. That'sa modified example of what we had last year, which wasn't verytroublesome. Is that more troublesome if we have just raised theupper end of the range to 8 percent. Does that raise more questionsabout why it's running at 9 percent than if we haven't raised theupper limit of the range from 7 percent. That is my simple question", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You can argue that we're doing the samething that we did for the second half of last year; but it meanschanging what we said for 1986, which is what most people will belooking at, I think. But you can argue that point", "MR. GUFFEY. It doesn't seem to me that enough certainty hascome into the ability to forecast M1 growth that we should adopt whatwe thought might be appropriate in July of 1985 for 1986. Indeed, thetrack record suggests that we are still uncertain and that the widerrange is more appropriate", "MR. MORRIS. May I remind you that a year ago at this time wewere sitting around this table talking about the fact that there hadbeen a one-time adjustment in the demand for M1 which was behind us.When Steve talks about M1 in 1970, he's talking about a differentanimal. We [now] are talking about an M1 that bears a market rate ofinterest. It is an entirely different phenomenon and yet we keep ondeluding ourselves that what we call M1 today is the same thing it wasin the '70s. It isn't. And it seems to me that's the fundamentalsource of argument about how to forecast Ml", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. This is really a small point, butthere is this tremendous concern about debt in the economy. I don'tcare what adjustments you make for advance refundings or anythingelse, it is a tremendous concern. The numbers don't mean a darnthing, but we have a published target on the record of a monitoringrange of 8 to 11 percent. Given all the concern in the marketplaceabout debt and given the concern abroad about debt accumulating in theUnited States, what signals does it send to raise it from thetentative target of 8 to 11 percent to 9 to 12 or something like that.I'm not going to go to war over it, but I think it is sending thewrong signals", " On Ml, I expressed my only concern about Ml; I think wehave--2/11-12/86MR. JOHNSON. You made an important point, I think. If it'sjust slightly above target, we run the risk of having the markets takeit very seriously--much more seriously than if it were running wayabove and it was fairly clear that it would be impossible to try toget it back into the target range as well as that it obviously was nota major concern. I do worry about financial market uncertainties whenM1 is hovering a percentage point or so above target and there is alot of uncertainty about whether the Fed is going to try to takeaction to get back within the target or let it go. I think it isimportant; how important--. There is a July hearing, right. Is itoften changed then. I really can't remember", "MR. AXILROD. The Committee has changed M1 quite a lot", "MR. MARTIN. Yes, I appreciate the contingency so long as itis symmetrical", "MR. MARTIN. If we don't make that amendment, then we reallyare featuring Ml; we are starting with M1 and finishing with Ml", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I don't have in mind a monitoringrange, but in some sense I think this doesn't give it equal weight", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You can ask the staff but it used to be,historically, that when you had borrowings this low you would get thefederal funds rate at the discount rate or below. But it's nothappening now", "MR. MELZER. I would be in favor of alternative B. I mightjust say that down the road my tendencies possibly would be to leantoward a somewhat firmer policy. I am, as you expressed before,concerned about the behavior of the dollar and the change inpsychology there. One interesting manifestation of that recently was2/11-12/86on the unconstitutionality of Gramm-Rudman. The bond markets herevery quickly looked right through that; I am not sure the foreignexchange markets did. There are other factors there, such as how thelow oil prices have differential impacts and what the creditimplications are for the United States and so forth, but along thelines of the argument that bigger deficits are more stimulative.Maybe that would be positive for the dollar; maybe that subtle shiftindicates that the dollar is starting to get to the point where thereis concern about the inflationary implications of the deficits and thefinancial problems and what that might imply for monetary policy atthis time. So in any case, for the moment, I would be in favor of\"B.\" I would lean possibly, depending on future developments, towarda somewhat greater degree of restraint down the road. Given that Ithink there are difficulties in projecting money looking forward, Idon't take a lot of comfort in the low projections looking out overthis period. That doesn't make me say that maybe we ought to betipping [policy] toward somewhat greater ease. I think we probablyhave been accommodative. In general I would tend to recognize thispenchant I have of leaning a little in one direction toward trying toget to $350 million as opposed to being overly sensitive to the fundsrate", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I note that the Greenbook'squarter-by-quarter projection has the second quarter of 1986 as aweaker quarter, at 2.3 percent. Whatever the error range is aroundthat, that is still a stepping down of growth from the first quarterwhich, as I read the consensus around the table here, is for a prettystrong rate of growth--stronger than the fourth quarter of 1985. Butwhat we do here today will have some effect on the second quarter of1986, although one can debate the time period needed to affectactivity. It seems to me that almost eliminates alternative C; thereis no compelling reason to raise interest rates at this time. Themarkets, of course, are going to start speculating or already arespeculating about what we are discussing here right now; certainly,they will speculate once the monetary data are released this Thursday.That will [result in] a little headline here or there when we starttalking about much lower rates of growth of Ml. We will release therecord of policy actions for December in a couple of days, so we aregoing to release some interesting numbers one day and some interestinghistory the next day. And the history is going to point toward thevery modest easing in that report for the December meeting.Moving to the alternatives, it seems to me that the markethas been telling us something. The market has been acting through thecommercial bank mechanism and has been keeping the borrowing numberslow relative to our target of $350 million. It seems to me that nowwould be the time to recognize the market signals and begin to movethe borrowing target first from $350 million to $300 million and thensee what the market response is to that. If the response isappropriate--if the federal funds rate begins to come down a little--then I'd very carefully reduce the borrowing level another $50million. I am not in favor of alternative A either for the samereason I reject alternative C. I think \"A\" probably takes us down tobelow the frictional level of borrowing. I don't know whether that is$150 million or $200 million or whatever. I think we ought to move inthat direction, though, in a couple of stages. That would permit theBoard of Governors to respond to the 5 or 6 remaining requests--I hopethey are remaining--to lower the discount rate. In other words, itwould give us some room to act in a way that would aim at that second-quarter figure and at the figures the staff has provided us for therest of the way. So, I am a \"B+\" person here with a [unintelligible]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You may have less so for the Chairman'sjudgment. Let me say that I find the analysis of this oil situation alittle ambiguous. Obviously, it is a plus on the price side but thefamous analogy is to a tax cut on the other side and an expansionaryinfluence on the economy. It seems to me to pull in the otherdirection from what you are citing. Be that as it may be, I thinkwhat you left out of your analysis is a big inflationary impact fromthe exchange rate which has gone down 25 percent or something likethat over the same period, roughly, that the oil prices came down; Idon't know how you factor that into your thinking. You are on the low-54-2/11-12/86side of the projections; I hope you are right. But the projectionscollectively, for what that's worth, don't show much change in theinflation rate", "MR. ANGELL. I would guess so", " Is it still 7-3/4 percent or--MR. AXILROD. I'd defer to Peter, to a degree. If youlowered it down to $300 million, I think the odds on it being at 7-3/4percent are increased and it might occasionally fall below that", "MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes, something centering around that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

The funds rate in the very short run ishalf psychology anyway; it is where they think it should be.

CROSS. [Statement--see Appendix", "MR. CROSS. Well, no. I would say that if you just look atthe trade position and the competitive position you can come to oneconclusion about where the dollar ought to be. Obviously, we stillhave a very substantial trade deficit. I think all the economistswould agree that we haven't begun to see much of the benefits of theexchange rate changes that already have taken place. And that wouldprovide some considerable improvement to our trade position. But wehave an enormous trade deficit to deal with. If you're looking at itstrictly from that viewpoint, you could persuade yourself that a4/1/86[unintelligible] very substantial, and even the very largedevaluations and depreciations that we've seen are not going toeliminate the trade deficit. But you can also argue that you can'texpect to eliminate all of this huge trade deficit purely by exchangerate moves. There have to be other things in there, such as growth inthe other countries. And you also have to watch very carefully theeffects of this on capital flows and whether the kind of exchange ratemovements he's talking about may lead to great problems for us on thecapital side", "MS.

In fact, some of the lending institutionsin the Twin Cities have stopped taking applications and have said thatthey may resume in the next five or six weeks; but they are just sobacked up that for the moment they have stopped. The housing marketin the Twin Cities generally is quite strong. Houses are moving veryquickly, generally at the asking price, which may imply people areasking too little. But right now at least, things are going very wellthere. I do expect, as do many others who have commented already,that the overall economy is going to strengthen soon because thefundamentals seem to be positive. I would add to those fundamentalsthe fact that Ml has grown as rapidly as it has over the past year ormore now. This would suggest to me, certainly, an amply accommodativemonetary policy and ample liquidity. Liquidity, too, is boosted ofcourse by this refinancing of home mortgages. To some extent, likePresident Horn, I have been a little surprised by the fact that theeconomy seems to be continuing to plod ahead while a lot of thefinancial factors--a lot of the fundamentals--have improved and haveimproved rather dramatically. But I expect that this separation ordecoupling between what has been happening on the financial side andwhat has been happening on the real side will probably end soon andthat we will see strengthening in the overall activity", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I, too, am in what I'd call theBoehne camp in the sense that I think the combination of oil prices,interest rates, exchange rates, and stock prices have to give somereal boost to the economy in the second half of the year. Ironically,at least for me, I am not quite so sure about the very near-termoutlook. I say that because I am not sure that we have fully factoredin the adverse short-run effects of the oil situation. In talking tosome of the major oil companies that are headquartered in the New Yorkarea, I did get the sense that the short-run cutbacks that they aremaking are very, very substantial. I don't know how you factor thoseinto business fixed investment numbers and so on, but something in mygut tells me that the net effect of that in the very short run couldbe larger than is built into the consensus-type forecast--and I thinkthe staff forecast is pretty close to a consensus forecast these days.There are a couple of anecdotal things to report. LikeFrank, I am now getting some suggestion that the computer business maybe firming, following a pretty soft period of three or four quarters.There is nothing hard and fast but, anecdotally, there is someevidence along those lines. The capital goods side is aggravated bythis short-run oil situation and is on the lousy side. Interestinglyenough, the suburban New York area is going through a housing boom.Housing prices are rising, at least on an anecdotal basis, very, veryrapidly in the suburban New York area. Some of the stories I hearstrike me as unbelievable in terms of the rate of price increase onexisting homes. But all in all, I think the outlook is respectable.Peter Sternlight and his people take these market pulse beats all ofthe time, and I was a little surprised in reading some of the materialthey put together in the last couple of days about more than a coupleof market types who apparently are taking a longer view of things andexpressing some concern that the underlying inflation situation,despite all of these great numbers we are looking at, really might notbe all that good. Presumably, that reflects concern aboutproductivity--General Motors sneaking in 3 percent price increases andthings like that--but I was a little surprised. It would not be asurprise for me to say that; I was surprised that other people weresaying that", "MS. SEGER. I certainly agree that there are these three verybasic positive factors that should be helping the economy but, asJerry and Bob have said, a couple of them can cut either way--particularly the oil price decline. Maybe when we feel good, we tendto emphasize the pluses of that rather than the minuses. Now that weactually are seeing lower gasoline prices at the pumps, that normallywould be viewed as a plus for auto sales; yet in the auto market weare seeing constraints coming from the consumer debt burden. I haveactually heard some bankers in the last couple of weeks--these groupsthat pass through town here on their circuit to visit people--say thatthey are beginning to pay attention to the delinquencies in theconsumer credit area and that there may even be a bit of evidence thatthey are going to look at credit standards. So that can be an offset,or at least a partial offset, to the lower gasoline prices.Also, I certainly would expect the lower long-term interestrates to help plant and equipment spending; yet at the same time thereare these questions about what is going to happen to tax reform.Until the [lawmakers] do something--either kill it or pass it or act-12-4/1/86on it decisively--many businesses are going to postpone makingdecisions on expansion or replacement of equipment because the taxconsiderations are simply too important to ignore. I can't quantifythat, but I think it is a real drag and, in fact, will tend to offsetsome of the good interest rate news until businessmen and women get abetter reading on that.Despite the lower value of the dollar, import competition istough in a lot of countries. I hate to admit this, being fromDetroit, but not everybody buys a foreign car just because the pricetag is lower than the price tag on a domestic car. I don't happen todrive an import but people tell me that there is a quality matter.So, I don't believe we are going to see import competition necessarilyknocked out immediately by the change in the exchange rate. It wouldbe nice to think that that would happen, but I don't assume it. Also,in the case of machine tools, I think it was my friend from Atlantawho pointed out that there is more import competition in machinery andmachine tools, and I hear that also. In addition, there is thiscommercial real estate problem that is even spreading into theMidwest. It's no longer just the people down in Bob Boykin's area wholike to put up buildings and keep them unoccupied; there are somearound the Detroit suburbs and elsewhere, where buildings are poppingup like mushrooms on corners. Again, this can be a drag, I think.Therefore, while I am fairly optimistic, I am not as optimistic as Imight be if I didn't think there were these somewhat offsetting dragson an otherwise very placid picture", " Well, but the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER", "-13-4/1/86MR. STERN. I haven't been in the showrooms lately, but I amunder the impression that prices of imported cars, in fact, have beenrising.SEVERAL. Yes", "MR. BLACK. We have one foreign car dealer who puts in a$1,300 adjustment to market to push the asking price way above list--in addition to the dealer enhancements, which are far above anyreasonable cost. So what appears to be the list price to everycustomer is about $2,000 above the suggested manufacturer's list.Everybody thinks he is getting a big discount. In fact, people arepaying above list right now on many foreign cars. It's very hard tobuy them at list", "MR. BLACK. Well, one would think so, but that's in fact whathappens. There is another dealer who gives you dealer list on oneside and all of these dealer additions. There are right many of thoseand they add up to right much.

There is talkin Japan about some kind of stimulative action within a week or so--not on monetary policy particularly, but presumably some kind ofbudget action--and I don't know what it means. Whether the action is[going to be] significant or trivial, cosmetic or real, I'm not quitesure. But there's going to be something there. I do think--notnecessarily as part of that package--that they are debating at thevery least, and probably debating in a positive way, whether somefurther reduction in their discount rate is appropriate in a period ofweeks, presumably before the Summit, which is some time in early May.I continue to have some concern about the rate of Japanese growth,although I guess our staff forecast has it a little faster now.Governor Angell", "MR. ANGELL. It seems to me that the uncertainties certainlyoutweigh the facts we know in regard to the future. It's importantthat we look at the day-to-day numbers; we may not want to believethem, but we ought to look at them and keep track of them. Themonetary aggregates certainly have rebounded in March. If thoseaggregates continue to move at the March pace, I think that might tellus something different than if growth falls back to the January-February level. I think it's very significant that in the globaleconomy and the domestic economy as well we have dramatic pricechanges. We end up with winners and losers. Before one concludes tooquickly regarding the impact of these kinds of changes, we have torecognize that sometimes the marginal propensity to consume for thewinners isn't always the same as it is for the losers. And it seemsto me that we do have a severe danger of encountering a world tradecontraction in this kind of environment. If that occurs, that's goingto impact the export markets and undoubtedly put more pressure on thedeflation of international commodity prices. Commodity prices aremoving sideways to slightly downward with oil excluded. If thosecommodity prices pick up speed on the down side, I think that is avery risky pattern. It's a risky pattern not just for agriculture andoil interests in the United States; a lot of the third world countriesare commodity sellers. And if we continue to thrust the third worldinto a position of not receiving any kind of a return on what theyhave to sell, they're not going to be buying as much as we mightexpect them to buy. But it seems to me that if we don't stumble,eventually these real balance effects will take place. I'm somewhatconcerned that oil prices at some point in time might not do what wewant them to do. I suppose all of us would prefer that they move up abit and stabilize. But we don't have any guarantee of that.It seems to me that we might need some rather dramatic movesif oil prices were to rebound sharply. So, I think we have to watchthings very carefully. I would indicate that I'm much moreoptimistic--I like to be optimistic about something--than the groupnow [and] as much as six months ago with regard to the inflationfront. It seems to me that it's imperative that we get our inflationrates down in the 2 percent or 1 percent range during this oil pricemove. If we end up with our staff forecast of inflation, I thinkthat's very bad news for the dollar and our future. So, I'm somewhatoptimistic that if there's any indication that prices are going tomove in another direction, we could be in for one heck of a deal", "MR. KICHLINE. We have numbers of 2-1/2 percent instead of3-3/4 percent for the first quarter and 1-1/2 percent in the secondquarter as opposed to 2-1/2 to 3 percent. It's a big effect", "MR. WALLICH. It seems to me that we hear a number ofelements that are to some degree inconsistent. If we don't get astrong move, which would be to my mind deleterious, we will get asmall to moderate move that perhaps will not look very strong, but atleast will give us adequate growth of GNP. But the problems inGermany and Japan trouble me a great deal more than what is likely tobe happening to us. We're seeing countries that are burdened withdifficulties, with balance of payments that they don't want totolerate. We seem to be willing to have $100 billion in one andanother $100 billion in the other and say that it makes no differenceif other countries are willing to live that way--our way. But I donot believe that they will be. And so I share the feelings that wewill some day get into these problems.

My view is very simplistic because when you getsophisticated the reality tends to get a little lost in this, I think.It is something like the long-term real growth potential of theeconomy, about which there's great doubt now. In my own mind I'd putit somewhere between 2-1/2 and 3 percent, give or take a margin oferror around that. So the Treasury yield at 7-1/4 percent is verylow, if you think the rate of inflation expectations, as in the Hoeysurvey, is 5 or 5-1/2 percent. [Unintelligible] between Treasuriesand corporate bonds opened up here. If you think the rate ofinflation expectations isn't properly represented by the Hoey survey--and I don't think it is--[unintelligible], then if you put theinflation expectations down lower than that 5 percent, of course, yourreal rates relative to corporates still look somewhat on the high siderelative to the expected rate of return.

It does seem to me that thelonger-run outlook will be validated if we are able to maintain theselevels of interest rates.

I amjust saying that we are getting a lower nominal [GNP], implying a morenegative velocity than we had before. So I guess the issue is: Ifthat lower nominal is all on the inflation side, that's fine; we oughtto consolidate our gains to some extent. But I think we ought to be alittle careful if we are still seeing the same trend in velocity thatwe've seen before, since we have had further interest rate declinesand inflationary expectation breaks. I don't know what the rightamount of reserves is to offset that. I see this as purely technical.I am not talking about an easier policy; I am only talking about apurely technical adjustment.

Around $70-$85 million on average roughly. Wewould expect it to pick up maybe into the low hundreds or somethinglike that over the next month or so.

These are pretty fine shadings.Let me jump down [in the directive]. I don't know if this language inthe directive is great, anyway. Do we want to make it perfectlysymmetrical in language in the third sentence. Or would we bettercapture [the consensus] by changing that sentence to say either\"somewhat\" or \"slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptableand somewhat greater reserve restraint might be\". We've used thatdevice from time to time. I think there is a question--we'vediscussed this before at times, though it wasn't appropriate when wechanged the discount rate this time. If for some reason, because ofinternational considerations or otherwise, it seemed appropriate toreduce the discount rate at some point, I take it that the sense rightnow--other things being equal--is that we might increase the borrowinglevel a bit rather than the opposite.4/1/86SEVERAL.

Like the previous three speakers and like thestaff, our forecast is for a pickup in the economy in the second half.But in fact we find the present situation disquieting. There is, ofcourse, no evidence today of this pickup and in fact it may bepostponed. I still believe that the past favorable developments willshow through in the economy, but sometimes I worry that maybe theyhave already shown through in part in the numbers we are seeing rightnow and that we will see less of a pickup than we all are forecasting.I certainly would feel better if we were seeing movement in somethingbesides the housing numbers.Like other parts of the country, we are seeing good housingnumbers in our District. I remind myself that under normalconditions, if I saw these kinds of economic statistics after such along economic expansion, I normally would not be hopeful about thefuture. But the incoming employment numbers keep me somewhat morehopeful, perhaps. If I have special concerns today, I think theycenter around the trade numbers and the inventory numbers. On thetrade side we expect a turnaround, and I would say that the businesscommunity expects a turnaround. In the Fourth District the businesscommunity, in spite of flat performance, is quite optimistic on thetrade turnaround side and on the overall economic outlook. I do find,however, that there is beginning to be a difference between theexpectations of the business community and of some of the economists Italk to who are beginning to be discouraged, particularly on the tradenumber, and who are talking about the need for the foreign exchange5/20/86rate to go down further. On the inventory side, of course, goodinventory numbers depend very much on what business expectations are.And I am concerned that, if this positive business mood I see beginsto slip, we may then be in for an inventory correction. While I thinkour patience will be tested over the next several months, I remainoptimistic about the second half; but with each passing month I growmore uncertain about it", "MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, our picture is a littledifferent in that it is not looking too good. Economic activity isdeclining. The data for the first quarter show that while the declinehas been modest it certainly is widespread. We expect thedeterioration to be more severe in this quarter and also in the thirdquarter. The energy sector has been referred to already; of course,it has been very hard hit. The rig count is the lowest since WWII.The employment in that area, though, has not come down quite as muchas one would have anticipated; it was down about 7 percent in March soour view is that we still have a lot more of that coming as we goalong. Oil prices have come back a little, but it doesn't seem thatthe increase, at least yet, is enough to give drillers muchencouragement. We would anticipate that prices probably could turnback down as we get on past summer. Construction is continuing tosubside, particularly on the nonresidential side. The value ofcontracts has been sliding for several months. Employment hasremained pretty strong and in fact is about at historically highlevels in nonresidential construction; so here again we expect to seea sizable reduction in the work force as the projects come off andthere are no new ones that are going to be replacing them. Othersectors of our economy are stagnant or declining. Manufacturing isaffected by the weakness of energy and construction, and agriculturecontinues to do poorly. The financial position of many of our farmersalso has been weakened further by the decline in oil prices becausethey are not getting the royalty payments from the oil wells that theyhave on their farms. Residential construction has been holding upfairly well but we would be more comfortable, as far as our financial5/20/86institutions are concerned, if multi-family construction would dropoff a bit.In sum, Mr. Chairman, we just are not really seeing very muchon the positive side in the Eleventh District. We share part ofLouisiana--the part that Mr. Forrestal doesn't have--and he reportedhow that state is doing. New Mexico we share with the Tenth Districtand that is not doing all that great either. So, we are a littlenegative", "MR. MELZER. That's right. I will have to try to offsetthis. As was reported last month--and this is somewhat dated, butright now what we have for the District are first-quarter data--thereis really strength across the board in terms of employment,construction, and consumer spending. Our District has been growing ata rate considerably in excess of the rate nationally. We have hadparticular strength in non-ag employment, including manufacturingemployment, and also in residential construction. Also, in general inour area I think the commercial overbuilding is occurring at a laterdate, so we would still anticipate strength in commercial constructionthrough this year with perhaps some slowing next year.Just talking to people in terms of what's happening on a morecurrent basis, I sense that the tone is very good in terms ofattitudes. One specific piece of anecdotal information: A retailer Italked to some weeks ago expressed some confusion as to why furnitureand consumer durable sales weren't really following the strength wehave seen in housing, which normally is expected. There is now someevidence in a couple of the major cities in the District that thoseareas are beginning to pick up.In my mind, one of the most significant developments in thisintermeeting period has been the shift in market psychology. I havejust focused on the government bond market, and I think there probablyis some good news and bad news in that. I guess the good news mightbe that market participants, broadly speaking, may be somewhat moreconfident in their outlook about this forthcoming strength in theeconomy. I would agree with what has been said about this dichotomywe have had in the current outlook and looking down the road for somestrength. I think there is some evidence in the bond market, anyway;I guess it's expressed in the form of concern that perhaps that infact is going to develop. The troublesome aspect of all of this iswhat it might imply in terms of inflationary expectations. I think itwas noted in Peter's report and in Sam's, to some extent, that therecould be a psychology emerging whereby the best is behind us in termsof oil price declines. We are beginning to feel the impact of thedecline of the dollar on prices, and perhaps we'll be moving into aperiod of cyclical recovery and have price pressures arising out ofthat. In connection with that we have had a steepening of the yieldcurve between the front end and the long/intermediate end of roughly25 to 50 basis points. There is always the possibility that this isjust congestion or indigestion from a large supply of securities,although all through this period we haven't really seen any supplyproblem showing through. I think it's significant to note this shift.5/20/86There is one other point related to the market: I attendedthe meeting of the Committee on Investment Performance about a weekago and it was interesting how many investment advisers--I would sayat least three, maybe four, and these tended to be more stock-orientedpeople--cited one of the very positive factors in their minds in termsof the outlook for the markets in general was the liquidity that wasin the economy. I think they were referring very specifically in thatcontext to what they perceived to be a generally accommodativemonetary policy. The question that raises in my mind is: If thefeeling develops that maybe the major move is behind us and thefinancial markets people start to shift some of that liquidity intospendable balances--and in fact start to spend it against a backdropof maybe some expectation of increasing prices--we could possibly beat a point where some of that liquidity that has been going into theeconomy gets pulled out for spending. That's just a question at thispoint, though", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just inject a question here. Therehave been a number of references to what favorable wage performancesare signaling, which I certainly think has been true in themanufacturing or goods-producing side of the economy. However, that'sa minority of the economy these days. What do you see going on in theservice side where wages and salaries have been relatively high. Isthere any improvement there", "MR. JOHNSON. I just want to make two brief [observations].I generally agree with what has been said so far on the staff'sforecast, although there are a couple of areas on which I differ alittle. I am generally optimistic; I do see things picking up in thesecond half of the year. But I think we are going to be disappointedon the trade side. What I keep seeing in Europe and Japan indicatesto me that we are going to get less growth out of the rest of theindustrial world than we had been expecting and, therefore, our exportmarkets are just not going to be there as strongly as we hadanticipated. So, to the extent that we built that into our GNPestimates, I think it is not going to materialize as strongly as wemight have thought. I do think things are going to look betterdomestically, although not as strong on our export side as we mighthave hoped.My other concern is that velocity, or the demand for money,still seems to be a major factor. I think a lot of this is acarryover from the sharp decline in interest rates we have had andfrom the oil price situation, which has broken inflationaryexpectations another small notch. So we're having an increase indemand for other checkable deposits as a result. Just yesterday thestaff was indicating that velocity growth has been around minus 9percent for the second quarter. That is really a hefty decline, sowe're on a similar--if not even sharper--trend than last year. Iexpect that to turn around a good bit in the second half of the year,but it has a lot of turning around to do. My expectation would bethat this velocity weakness will probably squeeze nominal GNP a littlefurther, so I am relatively optimistic about it. I hope that comesmore out of the inflation side than the real GNP side;` but given whatis going on and my expectation on the trade side, I think that weprobably will see a lower nominal GNP performance and maybe some sortof balanced squeezing between inflation and real GNP in the secondhalf.But once again, I think there is reason to be encouraged. Ijust think we are going to be disappointed on the trade side becauseJapan and Germany don't seem to be willing to pursue the kind ofstimulative policies that we might like. I am talking about the factthat they have slack and potential from the oil price declines becausethey are major importers; I am not talking about demand driven typepolicies. They have a lot of potential and a lot of slack. Even ifthey are willing, they have some problems--institutional problems that[make them] resist being more stimulative", " Germany, as I said, isboxed in by the EMS; they are at the bottom on the currency[arrangement] so they are in danger of falling outside their range ifthey try to get rates lower unless France goes along. Japan seems to-13-5/20/86be resisting lower interest rates through their postal saving systemand there are a lot of other institutional areas of resistance. Ithink they are eventually going to adjust; they are just going to beslow to adjust. I think political pressures will be brought to bearafter the elections in Germany, but hopefully it won't be the wrongkind of expansion. I am a little troubled by the idea of a publicworks project as a fiscal stimulus--being the source of expansion. Ithink they will be slow to adjust. I think our trade sectors aregoing to come around slowly", "MR. KOHN. [Statement--see Appendix", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just raise one question that Iraised yesterday, which you probably don't have any answer for at thispoint. You mentioned the great liquidity in the economy; some otherpeople have mentioned that. Yet, if you look at our liquid assetsseries, it hasn't been doing much. Can you explain that dichotomy", "MR. KOHN. I think there are two things that explain it. Ifyou look at the components, you can see that this must be a seasonaladjustment problem more than anything else. Short-term Treasurysecurities, which were very strong in November and December, have beenrunning off on balance in this seasonally adjusted series in 1986.Now, the Treasury clearly has continued to rely on coupons for most ofits financing but I don't believe there has been a change in its basicfinancing pattern here", "MR. WALLICH. May I say a word. The [forecast for] theUnited States seems entirely plausible but it might be quite differentfrom what many objective viewers think, and I think we have to takemore account of [unintelligible]. If we don't, we're going to get anincrease in the negative trade [unintelligible]", "MR. BLACK. Did you settle on yours", "MR. GUFFEY. They are continuing to fall, Mr. Chairman. Asfar as agricultural land values, from the survey that we take at theend of every quarter, they are down another 5 to 6 percent across theDistrict; that would be roughly 50 percent of their highs in 1981.With respect to the agricultural sector, the winter wheat crop is ingood shape; it's perhaps a very good crop. The other plantings thatwould take place in the spring are going forward well ahead of theusual schedule. There are about 5 to 7 percent of agriculturalborrowers that will not get credit this spring and, as a result,something will have to be done with respect to foreclosure. They willnot be able to put in a crop. So, there is some good and bad in thesense that the crop is good and commodity prices are up marginally,largely because of the Russian disaster. On the other side of thecoin, red meat prices are down largely because of governmentalprograms with respect to the dairy herd buyout which depressed redmeat prices very substantially.In the energy sector, the story has already been told. Whathas happened to Bob Boykin's District has happened to the TenthDistrict in spades. For example, the rig count as of January 1 in theTenth District was at 550; in May it was 236. And that [compares with]a number of about 1700 working rigs in the District at the height ofthe oil boom. As far as manufacturing is concerned, again, it's amixed picture. Missouri, as I think you know, is second only toMichigan in auto assemblies. Those plants are going full out so thatin the urban areas, particularly Kansas City, things are looking verygood and unemployment is lower than the national average. On theother hand, general [unintelligible] aviation aircraft, farm-17-5/20/861, if maybe we won't have to see some more paring back in the thirdquarter because they are at close to 2 million units and that isprobably 400,000 to 500,000 units above where they would like to havethem. Have they taken enough out of production schedules to achievethat, given the current sales pace. Again, I don't know the answers;these are just questions", "MR. KICHLINE. It depends, obviously, on what they do withtheir incentives and whether they are going to gin up some more salesby doing something on the price side. In the GNP sense, in billionsof dollars, the second-quarter change in the automobile sector isworth about $15 billion in real terms. We have [projected] another $3or $4 billion in the third quarter which indicates that, yes, they aregoing to have to take more out. Now, that assumes that they havealready [unintelligible] the working off of current-quarter productionschedules; we think that they will have to do more. One of thedifficulties that I might note here is that the Commerce Departmentuses seasonal factors that some might doubt. But using ourinformation, they have their seasonal auto production going from 9million units in the first quarter to 7.3 million in the secondquarter. So it's a big dip. And we assume that a small further cutwill occur in the third quarter", "MS. SEGER. Okay. Another thing that has suddenly started tobug me is the feedback of these weak sectors on the Treasuries ofvarious states and what that may do to their urge to spend. Iunderstand that several states already are noticing the problems withtax collections. Is this not something else that could change andcontribute to some sort of drag on the economy. Also, the revenuesharing, I believe, is continuing to be attacked here in Washington.For many states--at least the one I am from--the revenue sharing hasfunded many, many different activities. My final question involveswhat Manley was mentioning about trade and how quickly the improvementwill actually show up in the data. My gut reaction is that the lagsmay be longer than any of us would like to see. I am not disputingyour forecast at all; I am just suggesting that maybe these are someof the matters that could in fact [unintelligible] on it. Thank you", "MR. JOHNSON. That trend is consistent with a decline ininflationary expectations I would think, so you're still left withthat major question about velocity", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I share the optimismabout growth over the second half of the year and, as a result, thelack of good evidence at the moment creates an uncertainty thatsuggests to me that alternative B is the appropriate prescription forpolicy in the period ahead simply because we don't know what ishappening and that alternative pretty much holds the current position.As to the directive itself, I would favor draft alternative II for thereason that there is a recognition of the rapid growth in theaggregates that has already taken place and that we would expectthrough the second quarter. And it places M2 and M3 first, withsimply a recognition following that of the M1 growth. Lastly, it doessuggest or maintain the idea that some firming could take place in thefuture given that rapid growth, if the economy begins to perform as wewould anticipate and the pressures begin to show up in prices. Allthose things to me seem to be consistent with (1) what we think andhope the outlook will be, and (2) a realization that M1, M2, and M3are outside [their ranges] and that the numbers are somewhat differentthan last month, but nonetheless we maintain them as guideposts", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I also support alternative B butfor different reasons, it seems. The stronger growth projected in thesecond half is really entirely a function of the improvement in thetrade balance, and our ability to forecast the timing and magnitude ofchanges in the trade balance is not so great that we can haveconfidence that we can forecast it extremely well this time. If wedon't get a third-quarter improvment in the trade balance, I think wewill continue to have a pretty sluggish forecast. I don't seeanything else that is going to pull the economy [up] very rapidly.So, I don't think we can move on the anticipation that the thirdquarter is in the bag yet. As a lot of people have said, we have tosee the whites of the eyes of this narrowing trade deficit.I question whether we are in fact putting excessive liquidityinto the system now. I proposed, when we were last talking about thelong-range targets, that we set targets for M3 and total liquid-29-5/20/86assets; I assumed a minus 1 percent velocity for 1986. As I look atthe fourth-quarter [and] the first-quarter rates of growth that wouldbe compatible with a growth of 6 to 6-1/2 percent for nominal GNP Idon't see that; the only thing in the picture that would lead one tothink that we are building excessive liquidity is M1. I am not verysure that we understand the meaning of that growth of M1 for futureeconomic growth.On the inflation front, I am more optimistic I think thanmany around the table, but I have been looking at what I call the\"core\" inflation rate and that is the price indexes eliminating foodand energy. If you do that, you see that there hasn't been anydeceleration in the inflation rate in 1985; and if you look at theprojected inflation rate for 1987, it doesn't look at all bad becauseit is not much different than the core inflation rate now. It justdepends on what set of numbers you have gotten used to looking at. Ithink quite clearly the recent sets of numbers for the CPI and thewholesale price index had a lot of one-shot effects from food andenergy that are not going to be repeated; we have to understand thatthis is an aberration. And when the inflation rate gets back to thecore rate, we shouldn't be too much alarmed because that was thefundamental situation all along.With respect to the directive, I appear to be the only onefavoring draft directive I. The reason is that it seems very clear tome that when we meet in July, we're going to look at the growth rateof M1 and either we will have to eliminate M1 as a target or rebase itagain. I think that is clearly in the cards. And if that is thecase, I don't see any reason to equivocate in letting the market knowwhat they already know: that we are discounting M1 in monetary policy.I don't think we kid anybody if we think the market feels otherwise.I don't think we can tell the market a different story with a[different] form of the directive than the former directive because Idon't think we really mean it. Are we really going to tighten upmoney and tighten up interest rates in a sluggish economy in order toget the M1 growth rate down. If we are not, then it seems to me it'stime to recognize that fact; and it seems to me directive I is anideal way of beginning to do that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. People can read the same thingdifferently, but I think the interpretation of keeping alternative Iwould be that nothing has changed in relative emphasis because wehaven't changed the language. If we want to change the relativeemphasis we would change the wording of the directive", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to stay in aholding pattern and that means I favor alternative B, like everybodyelse. On the directive, I favor alternative II. I also favor beingneutral. And I see no conflict in being neutral with allowing themarket to know that we acknowledge what's happening with theaggregates without making a judgment; we just let the market know thatwe know this. I think not to do that would risk giving the wrongsignals. So, I would prefer alternative II. While I think we now areprobably closer to the time when we may feel some need to snug up abit, I would be careful not to give any indication to the market thatI felt that way, because it just might make it happen; it might giverise to something", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich, you can interrupt allthis unanimity for Alternative B", "\"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You want to tighten up a little", " One way to achieve thatwould be in--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't accept that as a premise", "MR. JOHNSON. I do agree with that point. If we acknowledgethe overshooting of M1 growth, which may be appropriate, I think we atleast ought to balance our acknowledgement of the growth of M1 withthe two possible meanings associated with that growth. One is that wehave a big bulge in money demand for various reasons associated withlower interest rates, declining oil prices, and all those things. Butit also can mean the opposite; it could be a warning of too muchliquidity. We don't know right now, it seems to me, which one ofthose meanings to apply to it", "MR. PARRY. But even there I have a problem because these arenot contemporaneous events. If one is expecting the real developments-36-5/20/86to follow what has happened with regard to the aggregates to someextent, then if we are waiting for that kind of confirmation and itoccurs, we may have to do a lot more later than we would like to do", "MR. GUFFEY. I read III as Frank does--that M1 is in some wayelevated", "MR. ANGELL. It seems to me that we could make some progressif we decide which draft we want to alter. Draft II has theaggregates mentioned and I slightly prefer to have the aggregatesmentioned. If we start from draft II, then let's make the changes.If everybody wants to start from draft III, okay, but I don't think wecan work from both of them at the same time", "MR. ANGELL. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Would we say M3 and M2. This says\"respectively;\" you didn't mean that.

THIEKE. [Statement--see Appendix", "MR. KEEHN. Yes", "MR. JOHNSON. I want to follow up on that same point too.It's still hard for me to understand how in the forecast you can getrising prices in the out years, both domestically and abroad, whencurrencies--especially the G-10 currencies--are appreciating relativeto the dollar. I see how you can draw a scenario where prices tend tocome back a little in the United States as a result of theappreciation of the dollar, with a lag as oil prices level off. Istill don't understand how you can get the same trend abroad withappreciation in their currencies relative to the dollar, especiallywith the fact that their currencies are appreciating even moredramatically relative to the non G-10 currencies against which the7/8-9/86dollar is also appreciating. So, I am having a rough time with thatscenario", " Isn't the impact of energy price developmentseven greater for them because it's a multiplier--MR. TRUMAN. You are multiplying--halving the dollar price ofoil and that times a 30 percent drop in the price of the dollar[unintelligible]", "MR. JOHNSON. Maybe we ought to start over", "MR. BLACK. Jim, isn't that a typographical error on thatchart. Shouldn't it be \"FOMC projections for 1986\" instead of 1985.We are bad [forecasters] if it was for 1985 and we missed it thatmuch", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I remember that we went tocontrolling monetary aggregates very recently because we didn't knowhow to forecast what level of interest rates would be needed to getthe nominal GNP growth that we sought. Now I think we have come fullcircle because, as I hear Don tell it, in order to set a range for Mlwe have to forecast interest rates for the year. If that is the case,that raises a question in my mind whether it makes any sense for us toset a range for M1 when we don't know what interest rates are going tobe in the coming year", "MR. RICE. I would hate to see us drop the target range forMl. I would much rather see us retain a target range but announcethat we don't expect the growth to be within that range", "MR. RICE. I would have no problem dropping it for 1987. Itwould be easier to drop it for 1987 than for 1986. I would prefer atthis time to keep 3 to 8 percent for 1987 too and change it later", "7/8-9/86MR. BLACK. I reach a rather different conclusion, Mr.Chairman. I think Don Kohn set a very good stage when he said thereal question was not what we do with M2 and M3 but what we do withMl. Even someone who has thought, as I have, that M1 has been soimportant has to admit that it has been behaving very strangely. So,I think it does deserve somewhat special treatment at this point; butI think it would be a decided mistake to downgrade it completely,since it is the aggregate that we can control better than any other.If we downgrade it, then that might jeopardize--and certainly would beperceived by a large part of the market as jeopardizing--our chancesof attaining our long-run objective of permanently restoring pricestability. I think we have to recognize that [prospective role] atsome point--that is, after the more normal relationship is re-established between M1 and the economy. With interest rates havingfallen the way they have, and with the general expectation that therewon't be a great deal of movement in the last half, I think we mightbe at the point where we begin to see those relationships resuming insome form or another. So if you buy that part, that gets to thequestion of whether to take these wider ranges beginning from thefirst of the year or whether to rebase. As they are set up in theBluebook, it really doesn't make a whole lot of difference so far asthe end point is concerned, because rebasing from 3 to 8 percentresults in a growth rate of 10.2 percent above the fourth quarter of1985 which would be sort of in the middle of these two alternatives--raising the ranges or rebasing back on the fourth quarter of lastyear. But to me it would be much more logical to rebase, because myguess is that this unanticipated further substantial decline in thevelocity of M1 in the first half of the year was due largely to thissharp decline in interest rates; and since we don't expect that tocontinue, to me it would make sense to sort of forgive that andrebase. But a second and more practical reason to rebase is that ifwe are going to move this range down over time, it is going to be alot easier--from a public relations standpoint--to move it down tosomething that eventually is compatible to price stability if we comedown from a rebased 3 to 8 percent than if we had 5 to 9 percent or 5to 10 percent and then suddenly said next year we want 3 to 8 percentor whatever it is we decide on. I would definitely rebase, and Ithink 3 to 8 percent might be a good place to put the range. And Iwould hope that in 1987 we could move it down somewhat from thatpoint", "MR. PARRY. I would be strongly against rebasing and alsoagainst changing the range. It seems to me that basically we have allconcluded that we don't know very much about the relationship betweenmoney and economic activity in the last 18 months, but moreimportantly, that we don't have much confidence that we will know allthat much more in the future. Consequently, it seems to me that themost honest thing to do is to leave the range for Ml where it is andsimply indicate, as is shown in the proposed language of variant I,that for 1986 we are leaving the range at 3 to 8 percent but we arenot going to pay a great deal of attention to it. As far as 1987 isconcerned, it seems to me that if you buy that--particularly if youbuy the idea that we are not confident of knowing what kind ofrelationship will exist between economic activity and money in 1987,then the choice is really an obvious one, and that is: Don't set arange. Because if we set a range--be it a range from a changed base7/8-9/86or whatever--it implies that we have some degree of confidence about areassertion of a predictable relationship between money and economicactivity. And I don't have that confidence", " I take itthat we don't have to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How can you have a monitoring rangewithout setting--", "MS. SEGER. I really think our credibility with financialmarket participants would be enhanced by admitting what is obvious:that we don't know what is going on with M1 and we can't reallyexplain it. The relationship between monetary growth, as measured byM1, and economic activity has certainly broken down. Therefore, weare better off not coming up with a quantitative range becauseregardless of what we call it--a monitoring range or something else--the Fed watchers still look at the numbers and they still plot andcompare actual Ml figures to whatever range we have mentioned. Also,the media pick these numbers up and do the comparison regardless ofour warnings about how risky it is to make something out of it. Theystill do. I think we would be better off dropping it--maybe\"dropping\" isn't the proper term; maybe \"putting it on ice\" orsomething like that would be the terminology to use. I think we are-16-7/8-9/86just misleading people when we keep a numerical range for either 1986or 1987", "MR. WALLICH. I think the behavior of M1 is still going to beso [uncertain] that the main issue is whether it is a viable target,regardless of whether or not its growth is going to be very strong.[Unintelligible.] So I would argue, not to trust too much in what wecan do in terms of the M1 numbers, but to in effect [monitor it].[Unintelligible]", "MR. PARRY. I have two additional comments. With regard to1986, I would be reluctant to support either alternative I or IIbecause I don't have much confidence that they could be reached,particularly if for some reason we felt that a somewhat moreaccommodative policy would be appropriate in the shorter term. Thesecond point relates to a comment Jerry made. I agree with Jerry thatwe should have a target for M1 to operate on in 1987. But please keepin mind that this is July of 1986, and what we basically could besaying is that we are not specifying a target in July because we donot have enough information. One could certainly address that issuefor 1987 at the beginning of December, if one wanted to, foroperational purposes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris, you are against anything[relating to] Ml. You would say drop it and bury it", "MR. MORRIS. My position is very simple, Mr. Chairman. Idon't think we can measure money in the old transactions balance sensein the United States. I don't think that we are going to be able todo it next year or the year after that or the year after that. Ithink it is nostalgia that is reflected in all of these comments aboutM1 returning to its historical relationships; the probability of that,given the changed character of Ml, has got to be extremely low. Itseems to me that at some point we ought to say we can't measure moneyin the old sense because of all of the institutional changes that havetaken place and, therefore, we are going to use liquid assets insteadof money as a target. I would have M2 and M3 and, since we alwayshave three targets, I would add total liquid assets", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think there is some disagreementabout how much weight we want to retain on M1 for some indefinitefuture period that we don't quite know about. I don't know how toresolve that problem. I suspect it's unresolvable in the sense ofgetting agreement among the members. I have a little logicaldifficulty with a monitoring range regarding what it means or at leastwhether we really want to do it. If we establish a monitoring rangethat means anything, we've got to establish a new target", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm really addressing it to the onlypersons, at least on this Committee, who said set a new range. Whenyou come up against Mr. Melzer and Mr. Parry, the problem is: How doyou know what you want to set", "MR. FORRESTAL. We used that term \"monitoring\" in 1982 or1983, I think it was", "MR. JOHNSON. We could keep the 3 to 8 percent, but[unintelligible] July", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You are going to get your two minutes to[expound to] everybody in a much longer discussion tomorrow. You canbe really persuasive, but I guess you are going to have to convincepeople that they may not want to swear by your new range but monitorby it. Suppose you made the range the numbers the staff has here.What are they: 6 to 11 percent or something", "MR. PARRY. Our forecast is very similar to that of theBoard's staff. We do have a slightly more rapid pickup in the secondhalf of this year, but I must admit that more recent information thatwe have about inventories raises the likelihood that the pickup willget a later start. Also, our forecast for business fixed investmentis slightly greater than that of the Board's staff. For 1987, ourforecast for growth is virtually the same. We differ in our inflationforecast; but I think our forecast of a percentage point higher numberfor inflation is not all that significantly different, given theuncertainties associated with the forecast at this time.In the Twelfth District, the general economic picture remainsquite mixed. We have quite a few industries that are doing well, suchas commercial aircraft, electronics, and retail trade. But we alsohave our share of weak industries. Agriculture is weak and a littleweakness has shown up again in the forest products area. The thingthat I would like to note is that in recent discussions with ourdirectors and also with our business and agricultural advisory counciland others in the business community, there has been a noticeableerosion of confidence in the last month or two. Before we werehearing optimistic signs from all of these people; now they seem tothink that things have become noticeably worse. Basically, I thinktheir comments are reflecting the weakness that actually did occur inthe second quarter. And frankly, they expect it to continue in thesecond half. I sometimes think that their forecasts are basedprimarily on what they see over their shoulder or what they areexperiencing at the present time. But I think it is significant thattheir sentiment has changed in the last month or so. On Thursday, wewill have a meeting of our board of directors. It's interesting tonote that at the last two board meetings there has been a very closevote against lowering the discount rate; I really think it's quitelikely that that's going to change at this Thursday's meeting", "MR. BOEHNE. The Third District continues to do better thanthe nation as a whole. Construction activity, particularly thehousing market, has been quite good. Pennsylvania ranks second onlyto California in the total number of existing homes sold during thefirst quarter, and the average cost of a house in the Northeast ishigher than the cost of a house in the West for the first time inrecent history. Nonresidential construction has begun to soften some,but not to the extent that it has in the nation as a whole. Retailsales have been especially good in the Philadelphia area; I think ithas something to do with the relative strengthening of expectationsabout the economic future of the area, which for a number of years wasnot good. I think it is beginning to catch up to people as theoutlook is better. Manufacturing continues to be something of a drag,but not as much of a drag as in the rest of the country. If you lookat things like help wanted advertising, that has reached a high pointand continues to be expanding. It's awfully hard, particularly in thesuburbs, to go into stores without seeing signs in the windows askingfor people to apply. I find the same kind of dichotomy, however, asBob Forrestal does. There does seem to be more optimism among peoplein smaller and medium-sized businesses than those in the older,traditional large firms. I guess that has to do with just the natureof the economy. I have not sensed a general deterioration insentiment, as Si has. I think sentiment is still reasonablyoptimistic for later in the year, although it may be more fragile thanit was a few months ago.Turning to the nation, there is something of a dichotomy inwhat I have just said about my own region and my views about what isgoing on in the nation. I am more bearish now about the outlook thanI was a few months ago. The reasons have to do with both the timingas well as perhaps some changes in the fundamentals--or at least ourperception of the fundamentals. In recent discussions around thetable, I think most of us have tended to emphasize the positive thingsabout the economy: the drop in the dollar and oil prices, etc., etc.Yet there are a number of drags: in petroleum, in farming, in exportdemand, and tax reform itself. While most people think it's probablygood over the long pull, there is definitely a drag in the short pull.7/8-9/86My sense is that we have tended to over-emphasize the effects of thestimulative factors and have not taken into account, at least toenough of an extent, those factors that are dragging on the economy.Part of it is timing, but I think some of it may be more fundamentalthan that. So where I come out is that, yes, I still think there isgoing to be a pickup. But I am less sure of that than I was; I havemore doubts about it. I find it quite difficult to see the threat oftoo much economic growth in the months ahead, but I could much moreeasily visualize too little. On the inflation front, I thinkinflation is an ongoing threat and we have to be careful about it andsensitive to it. But it does strike me as less of a threat now thanthe threat of too anemic an economy as we go to the end of 1986 andinto 1987", "MS. HORN. My forecast is similar to the staff's forecast,but I have found myself in the last three or four months relativelyconcerned about the downside risks of the forecast. I focus theseconcerns on two particular areas. First of all, like many others, myforecast depends on a significant improvement in exports and I wonderwhether that is really going to come to pass. The other area that Ifocus my concerns on is the long list of imbalances in the economy.I'm not quite sure how that works through the forecast as would thefailure of net exports to improve; but the list is long and this seemsto me to be a very difficult economic environment for a recovery tocontinue.Turning to the District, our recent numbers show nosignificant strengthening but no significant deterioration in economicactivity. From businessmen in our District--our directors among them--I sense a growing caution but not yet disappointment in the economy.Perhaps they are not disappointed on the trade side because they werealways skeptical about the trade rebound; they didn't expect it and ithasn't happened. They continue to report intense import competitionand we, like Si Keehn, also have industries that simply have beenunable to lift their prices. Again, as in Si's District, ourbusinessmen and directors seem fairly happy with the laborarrangements they have. I know it's fashionable to talk about changesin work rules when you have labor settlements, but I hear that talkoften enough and from enough people that I think they are notposturing--that maybe this is really happening. I hear a lot of goodfeelings about the whole labor arrangement that businessmen arefacing. A lot of the them seem to attribute the present sluggishnessto the up-front problems with the oil industry. We have a reasonableamount of that in Ohio; Marathon just announced layoffs yesterday, asa matter of fact. In conclusion, I think the economic outlook isgood, but the risks are increasingly on the down side", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, the New England economy isstill growing extremely well as exemplified by the fact that McDonaldsis offering $4.95 an hour and is still having trouble finding peopleto flip hamburgers. But my reading is that the national numbers arevery disturbing. I have been very optimistic that we were going tosee an acceleration in real activity in the last half of the year,certainly on the basis of what the broader monetary aggregates have-30-7/8-9/86done in the first half. That suggests that we ought to be seeingabout a 7 percent nominal GNP growth, and I thought that was justabout right. But the staff is now forecasting 5 percent instead of 7percent. And I am inclined to agree with Mr. Boehne and Mrs. Hornthat if there's something wrong with our forecast, it could be thatthe forecast is too optimistic. I see a sense of contrast between[the economy and] the financial numbers. If I were sitting on adesert island and had only the financial numbers, I would say there isa tremendous boom going on in the United States. But if you look atthe numbers for real activity, the last month gives no encouragementthat we are going to get a faster rate of growth in the third quarter.The new orders figures certainly don't suggest it. The decelerationin the rate of payroll employment gains doesn't suggest it. I reallydon't understand what is going on out there. The system is notresponding according to the rule books that I would follow. So, Ifind this very disturbing. For months I have been thinking thatmonetary policy has been doing everything it could to produce ahealthy economy. I am less confident of that today because of theseeming failure of the real economy to respond to what the financialeconomy has been doing", "MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, as I have been reporting,things have not been going all that well in our District. TheEleventh District economy seems to be about the weakest in thecountry. Not only has our situation gotten a little worse, we expectit to deteriorate even further and possibly at a bit faster pace. TheTexas unemployment rate in June rose to 10-1/2 percent, and that's thehighest level in modern times, certainly, for Texas. New Mexico andLouisiana expect to show increases in unemployment when their databecome available. The last report for Louisiana was 13 percent andthat's probably on the way up. As conditions worsen in energy,construction, and manufacturing, that is having some fairly severeeffects on our financial institutions. If you read the papers, it'spretty hard not to see one of our Texas organizations being featuredin one of the articles. Their performance has really not been allthat good. Looking at it from a supervisory standpoint, we don't[rate] our major bank holding companies very high from a supervisorylevel. Those that seem to be doing a little better we wonder about,because some of their major subsidiaries haven't been examined for ayear or year and a half and that makes us a little concerned over whatthe true situation might be.Now, I tried very hard to find some positive elements ofstrength in our District to report this time, but I just was notsuccessful. Aside from this regional report, though, I continue tofeel with regard to the broader picture that there will be some modestpickup in the second half of this year. Our forecast is in the middleof the forecasts of the Reserve Bank presidents. And we think this issustainable into 1987, if there's some monetary stimulus that comesabout to offset the economic drag of the uncertainties that areinherent in the fiscal environment", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Just a couple of quick words aboutthe District situation, which I think is a lot like others havedescribed in that small and medium-sized firms, even in manufacturing,are doing quite well to very well. Nonresidential construction andthe housing markets are very, very strong, especially in the New Yorkmetropolitan area. The service sector--and of course there's aspecial premium on financial services--is in a state of near frenzy.But there's a great question in my mind as to how sustainable that is.The large firms, especially large manufacturing firms--both those that[operate] there and those that are headquartered there--are by andlarge pretty dismal in terms of their outlook. Even in the case ofIBM, which earlier in the year seemed to think that things were aboutto take a turn for the better, certainly doesn't have any convictionbehind that outlook at this juncture.In terms of the national economy, my own forecast is verysimilar, and almost identical, to the staff forecast in both theaggregate sense and in most of the details. But I must say, I haveperhaps as little conviction about a forecast at this point as I'veever had. I could easily put together a forecast that's stronger andI could easily put together one that's weaker. Some of the factorsthat have been mentioned--energy, commercial construction, andagriculture--are the obvious things that would point in the latterdirection. But abstracting from those particular areas of concern, Ihave two overriding concerns: the first is this financial sectordichotomy that Frank Morris referred to. I too find it very hard torationalize the patterns of behavior that we see in financial markets--not just in the United States but around the world--with what seemsto be going on in the real economy. And I have a nagging feeling thatwe may be a little more accident prone there than we would like to7/8-9/86admit. I say that not with a view on nonperforming loans at banks, asmuch of a problem as that can be in its own right, but more that whenI look at the sheer volume and volatility that we see in the financialmarkets these days, I can't help but think that when we have a 62 or63 point change in the Dow-Jones average in one day, that in itselffeeds on this sense of uneasiness that a number of people have beenreferring to around the table. It makes you scratch your head alittle and say: What the heck is going on here.The other area of great concern that I have that transcendsthese particular sectoral concerns is the continuing economic,financial, and indeed political, implications of the trade and currentaccount situation. I read all the books about J-curves and all therest of the [hype] but I must say I still have, and perhapsincreasingly, a great deal of difficulty seeing how we will workourselves out of that situation in an orderly way short of arecession-induced correction, which would obviously be very, verymessy.As a number of people have suggested, I too sense that maybeconfidence levels have ebbed a bit. I think the reason for that maywell be associated to some extent with these financial market goingson. But I also think that there's a little phenomenon taking placenow where for a variety of reasons--including, for example, the courtruling on Gramm-Rudman--the imbalances that have been there all alongare maybe showing through in a more transparent way than has been thecase. Again, I think we've got to keep some perspective on thoseimbalances. The staff forecast, for example, is going to produce anunemployment rate in 1986 of 7.1 percent. Now, the last time we hadan unemployment rate of 7.1 percent was in 1980. When you look atwhat has happened since 1980, there have been some very good things:the inflation rate has come down from 10 to 2-1/2 percent and we arenow in one of the longest economic recoveries on record, despite thisenormous trade deficit. But when you look beneath that, in 1980 wehad a trade surplus in real terms in excess of $50 billion. We nowhave a trade deficit in real terms of $140 billion. In 1980, thebudget deficit was $50 billion or $60 billion; it's now $200 billionplus. In 1980, the personal saving rate was 7 percent; now it's 4percent. And those fundamentals are not going to change very easily.To some extent, I think what we're seeing right now is a renewedappreciation that those fundamentals are there. And the final irony,of course, is that if indeed the economy were slipping badly, one ofthe things one thinks about doing is trying to provide some fiscalstimulus. But as a practical matter, we're not exactly in the idealposition to be able to do that. It all comes back to saying that thewhole ball game seems unfortunately to rest on monetary policy. It'sa very difficult outlook; and I guess I would be in the camp withthose who are more worried rather than less worried", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I think the staff's forecast isabout the best way of looking at things right now. I continue to lookfor the pickup in the second half, though it likely will be less of anacceleration than I expected a month ago and probably will be later inthe second half than I expected. But like others, I find thesituation looks more clouded than usual, in part because of some ofthe factors pointed out by Frank Morris and Jerry Corrigan. It is7/8-9/86very difficult to read what is going on right now. At the presenttime, I have less confidence in my view of the future than I have hadin some time. It could be that I am being, as are others, undulyinfluenced by the most recent data that we have seen over the lastmonth. I hope that is so. But if we stand back and look at what isgoing on, I think we have to recognize, as Gary Stern pointed out,that some of the factors that have been dragging down the economy arelikely to become less influential in the future. The fundamentalsthat we counted on to spur the economy are still there. In my mind,it is hard to imagine that business fixed investment will come inlower than the staff forecast. It seems to me that [the forecast] inthat sector is probably a rock bottom outlook. And while a turnaroundin net exports may be delayed somewhat further, it is hard to imaginethat it will be delayed beyond the second half. I expect that we willsee this acceleration before the end of the year, and my own guess isthat the risks are not on the down side--that we are not likely to geta poorer performance than the staff's forecast. If anything, it willbe somewhat better than the staff's forecast. Now, all of this isclouded further by the overhang of tax reform. Tax reform, of course,is factored into the staff's forecast. But in my mind, there arecertain psychological effects that can't be factored in, which couldperhaps have a more restraining impact than one would imagine at thepresent time. This would be especially true if the revenue raisingprovisions kick in ahead of the cut in rates. So, while I wouldrepeat that the risk is probably on the up side of the staff'sforecast, there are these imponderables out there that are verydifficult to factor in", "MS. SEGER. Well, I think business is sluggish and I think ithas been sluggish for most of this year. Economists, both within andoutside government, that I have spoken with in the last week or soseem to be busily revising their forecasts--mostly downward--probablyin reaction to the recent rather weak indicators. Back in February, Ithink Wayne Angell and I had the two lowest forecasts for real GNPgrowth for this year; mine was 2-1/2 percent. And after hearing allthe bullish comments at the table, I was feeling guilty about it so Itook advantage of Jim Kichline's offer to accept revisions and I putit up to 3 percent. Now I have moved it back down to 2-1/2 percent;I'm going round trip on this. Unfortunately, I just don't see what isgoing to cause business to pep up. I would like to see it happen; Iwould like to see stronger growth in the second half of this year. Iwould like to see a very healthy, dynamic economy next year too, but Ijust have doubts about our ability to pull it off. I know we arerelying very heavily on a trade turnaround, but the people in tradethat I speak with have convinced me that it is going to be verydifficult to do. We have already seen that the lags are longer; theyare going to be still longer. I agree with the comments of PresidentKeehn and Governor Rice and some of the others about the impact of taxreform. Just the uncertainties that have arisen from the proposalshave tended to curb businesses' enthusiasm for expansion andmodernization. And if what is in the Senate bill actually becomeslaw, the disincentives to investments are very, very great", "MS. HORN. Paul, would you comment on a strategy that wouldinvolve our easing policy or lowering the discount rate or whatever.What kind of pressure would that put on foreign countries to, say,stimulate their economies", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just get a general show ofpreferences. This is quite a narrow difference between 6 to 9 percentand 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent. Nobody wants to talk outside that range,I take it. How many would favor 6 to 9 percent. I'll get preferencesfrom everybody now, just for the fun of it anyway. How many preferthe other way. We are going to be pretty evenly split, I am afraid.We have a pretty even split", "MR. JOHNSON. Same here", "MR. ANGELL. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that contemplates setting a rangefor 1987, but we'll have to discuss what range to put down for 1987.We had two alternative proposals yesterday. One is rather pro-formato keep it at the 3 to 8 percent with all the reservations Isuggested, and Governor Angell resuggested a much wider range of 3 to10 percent. That looks so wide; it looks a little peculiar, unless wecan make it 5 to 10 percent or something", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we can. I don't think we shouldfool around by a 1/2 percentage point or something like that. Thatdoesn't make any sense to me", "MR. BLACK. Well, the thing that bothers me, Mr. Chairman, isthat nobody wants M1 growth of 3 to 8 percent. That's not reallyoperationally very significant. As we closed yesterday, I thoughtJerry was making a very good point in arguing for wider ranges andhigher ranges. I personally prefer to rebase. But I'd prefer what hewas suggesting to this because if by chance--and maybe it's a veryremote chance--Ml does reassume some of its previous characteristics,we really don't have anything operational that we can do with this 3to 8 percent target at all, but we could with a larger one. We couldtry to come in under that, if that should happen", "MR. PARRY. It seems to me that we all are saying that wedon't have any confidence about the relationship between money and thegrowth of economic activity at this time. Therefore, I don'tunderstand why anyone would try to set a range for 1987 at this time.Is there some procedural reason why it makes sense", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I understand correctly--on the theorythat it is more important that we [not] fiddle around with it--I thinkthe choice is between leaving it at 3 to 8 percent or leaving it outcompletely. If we leave it at 3 and 8 percent I envision presentingit enclosed in brackets and with an asterisk, footnoting why we haveleft it unchanged for this year. We certainly feel quite open aboutchanging or even not having it at all next year", "MR. ANGELL. There might be some sentiment for just droppingit", "MR. MELZER. Anyway, I'll tell you what my main concern is.I am sensitive to some of the political considerations at this timeand also to the views of other Committee members about the7/8-9/86uncertainties and concerns. What concerns me the most is this: Wehave just received the court ruling on Gramm-Rudman, which could havea major effect on the psychology in the markets about deficit cuts;and we have experienced lately a weakness in the dollar and have heardreports about the possibility of a diminished willingness offoreigners to hold dollar-denominated securities, given shrinkinginterest rate differentials, and so forth. I think there could be aconsiderable risk, because of these two developments taken together,in our moving at this time to reduce our rates; it sounds as if itmight be unilateral, at least for a while", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But we have a theoretical action. If thediscount rate is reduced, we can increase the reserve restraint alittle. As for the argument about changing the discount rate and theeffect on the economy, we haven't got a good choice. There isobviously a lot to these arguments. If it were entirely up to us--ifyou conceive of it as I do--the question is whether we have any chanceof getting some improvement abroad. To a considerable extent, thedilemma for us is that it may [depend] less on our policy than onother people's policies. And this is going in reverse from the way itshould go. I don't deny that for a minute. But it's not going to gowithout our moving. It is also true that we are not going to get animmediate response, as near as I can see it, from the Germans and theJapanese. But should we properly sit here and say: \"Well, if you arenot going to move--and at least as aggressively or more aggressivelythan we move--we are not going to do anything\". Where are ourresponsibilities. [Rather than] sit here saying that, we can take achance that we can push them a little, given the risks that youeloquently described, which I think are there. It's a question ofwhere the risks lie. I don't think the change--unless it's a muchbigger one--is going to have any very significant effect on our short-run or intermediate-term business outlook. Does it have an effect ontheirs. It goes in that direction. Maybe it's not very powerful;it's a pretty weak reed, but it's the only reed we have. It's theonly argument we can make", "MR. JOHNSON. No, but the gap would widen", "MR. JOHNSON. I think the expectation is that Japan may dosomething. They don't seem to be indicating that they want to dosomething, which may be of some surprise in the exchange market. Butthat's the whole question", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The danger in the whole situation--and Idon't know how to avoid it--is that if we do have a real decline inthe dollar and they are not very eager to act, their business outlookmay deteriorate from what it is now", "\"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Parry", "MR. ANGELL. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I just want to make sure that I'm notimposing something on you. People are saying--if they think we oughtto be making some move in the easing direction--that it should comepreferably through the discount rate rather than a lowering of theborrowing", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How can we say [the Committee] decreasedreserve pressures. Maybe the Federal Reserve System did, but theCommittee did not", " But since we--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Suppose we took the opposite course", "MR. JOHNSON. That is actually not true. If the discountrate is lowered, we are not maintaining the same degree of reservepressure", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. We could even just say \"takingaccount of the level of the discount rate.\" That covers thepossibility that the Board, in its wisdom, doesn't want to lower thediscount rate", " Weare starting July pretty low; on the other hand, if we come in wayabove--MR. ANGELL. Yes, with a cut in the discount rate--if theelasticity of the demand for money is anything like it has been--weare probably going to get another boost", "MR. JOHNSON. Well, I was just thinking about this onesentence here that says: \"Somewhat lesser restraint might beacceptable in the context of a marked slowing in money growth andpronounced sluggishness in economic performance.\"SPEAKER(.). That's out", "MR. JOHNSON. 5 to 8 percent doesn't really fly. Well, Idon't know; I guess it is getting closer to the range", " In no--MR. PARRY.

From their viewpoint, they are concernedabout impressing the Mexican public. What they are specificallyafraid of is that if they show too low a reserve figure on August 31that will contribute to capital flight. There would be concern thatthey really don't have enough money to get through this period and itwould undermine confidence within Mexico and make their problem morecomplicated by fomenting capital flight. That's the way they look atit. But I do think there is this other concern that an unduly largereserve position in the eyes of the banks will only encourage thebanks to say: There's no great urgency about our reaching an agreementand maybe they don't need so much money after all. Those are the twothings that have to be balanced. I'm not certain of this, but I don'tsee why there would be any announcement of when the drawing takesplace on this regular facility. So I assume that people willinterpret the reserve figure at the end of August, if it looks aslarge as as already including a drawing on the bridge.

The forecast, I think, is reasonably balanced.There are risks on both sides of this and I wouldn't say they areskewed in any significant way. Obviously, we have a forecast thatshows improvement over time. Some of the risks have been talkedabout, certainly [at the FOMC meeting] in July. On the down side, forexample, one of the risks relates to what's going to happen to thetrade sector; it's clearly a key in this forecast. And that raisesquestions about foreign growth and demands for our own exports. Oneof the downside risks is in business fixed investment. Frankly, inthe office and commercial area it now seems that both commitments andstructures are going down at a tremendous rate. That sector could beone for which we perhaps have underestimated the severity of thedecline. On the other side, I'd say we do have a slackening in growthof consumer spending that we think is consistent with what's happeningto disposable income. There's just no question, if you look at thedata, that consumers have been quite willing to spend and[unintelligible] generated enough income in this forecast, it seems tome, that consumer spending at the rate we have could look verymoderate. So, there are risks on both sides, and I think it's ratherreasonably balanced at the moment", "MR. HELLER. Well, I think it would be very nice if theforecast came true, but I'm pretty pessimistic. [I doubt] that we aregoing to see [export] growth rates of up to 15-1/2 percent on aquarterly basis. Certainly, in Europe and Japan it's going to be verytough for Americans to make rapid inroads into those domestic markets.And at the going exchange rates, I don't think we really have acompetitive advantage, although we have roughly leveled the playingfield versus other industrialized countries. I don't see the growthin the LDCs--and I think that's where the relative exchange ratemovement probably has a bigger role to play, because when you'recompeting in [third] markets you're on more equal terms than whenyou're competing in foreign home markets--in spite of the generosityas far as Mexico is concerned. The federal deficit, I think, plays arole too. And that certainly isn't going to come down as fast as thetrade balance comes down [in your forecast], from $146 billion to $82billion at the end of the forecast period.

You get a big difference between the realfigures and the nominal figures, which gets very confusing", "MR. BOEHNE. The same is true in the Mid-Atlantic states.You hear some anecdotal evidence here and there that suggests thatperhaps there are a few more orders. But there's a great deal ofskepticism that any kind of a major turnaround in the trade sector isgoing to occur. In addition to the arguments that have already beengiven, the market share argument keeps coming up: that withunemployment high in European countries, it's just very difficult tolose those markets even with thinner margins. So we don't seeanything that would lead us to share the kind of optimism that'simplicit in the forecast", "MR. JOHNSON. I'd just add to this a little. I agree thatconsumption seems to be doing quite well, but I think that we'reprobably putting too much emphasis on the G-10 trade-weighted dollarfor the reasons that already have been mentioned. We're doing quite abit of trade with a lot of countries whose currencies are stilldepreciating relative to the dollar; Canada and Mexico, our bordercountries, are good examples of that. It's not unreasonable to expectto see a continuation--well, there may not be a deterioration in ourimports but, of course, if oil prices bounce back up a little we maysee a further deterioration in imports. And with all the relativeweakness in European and Japanese demand we're certainly not going tosee improvement on the export side of the market. It is verydifficult for me to see where this domestic production is going tocome from. I still think that we're probably overestimating theimpact of the trade-weighted dollar against the G-10 countries. Ithink that's the problem", "MR. KEEHN.

Gradually, the business of the manufacture ofhas been coming under foreigncontrol; as you know, within the last week there has been a furtherdevelopment on that.

There may be disagreements about thisbecause people have different ideas about what should be done with thediscount rate. I guess I am arguing that the decision ought to beleft to the discount rate as the more appropriate tool now.

We had rapid growth in the aggregates in July; wedon't know with much conviction what they are going to do going out,but we are certainly coming off that. We have been listening to Samand others talk for some time now about the vulnerabilities of thedollar and this just does not strike me as a very opportune time totake this step. I certainly can see circumstances going forward wherethe environment might be far more preferable to the current one. So,I would be somewhat hesitant at this point. I can certainly live with\"B\" as specified, but I am not very comfortable about a discount ratereduction soon", "MR. MELZER. Gary, you have said everything I was thinking--almost. I would agree with that position in general. I have just acouple of other observations. It seems to me that we are taking, in asense, a marginal approach to policy. If we take a look at what hashappened in the intermeeting period in terms of the economy and we arenot happy with that then we think about easing policy further. And Iam not sure that we have given enough time for the accommodativepolicy that we have been pursuing for some time to take effect. I amconcerned about the risk that Gary cited and I share his feeling aboutthe outlook right now. I mentioned some of the commentary in thepopular press about inflationary expectations seeming to be reviving;I might also mention that long rates since two discount rate cuts agoare actually higher now than they were then. We have had a steepeningin the yield curve. I have a little trouble with the thought thatsomehow lower rates are going to help the economy here. I think themarket place, in a number of different ways, is telling us to becareful in terms of inflationary expectations. So I would be in favorof alternative B, the $300 million borrowing target, and no change inthe discount rate", "MR. BLACK. I am very closely in agreement with Gary Sternand Tom Melzer on that. I consider this scenario that the staff hastraced out in its projections to be a very fine outcome for this[stage of the] cycle--in the fourth year and into the fifth year. Ican see the arguments on the international side, but trying to nudgethese other countries into action--. I just can't see how any furthereasing will do anything to our domestic problems, most of which can'tbe addressed by monetary policy. The aggregates are running throughthe ceiling and I can see and understand very well why we'vedowngraded Ml. I even agree with that, which may surprise some ofyou. But somewhere along the way the aggregate numbers are going tomean something. And at some point we are going to have to get back to8/19/86some kind of procedure in which targeting aggregates and trying to hitthe targets is part of [our policy approach]. Or else we are going tobe back in an inflationary environment somewhere along the way; Idon't know how soon, but it is coming. So, I just can't see the caseon the domestic side at this point", "MS. SEGER. Since I am concerned with the generalsluggishness of the economy and the specific areas of significantweakness, I think that the risk in the staff's forecast for the nextsix months and for 1987 is probably on the low side, particularlybecause of questions about tax reform and the various points madeabout international developments. I can live with alternative B,assuming that it will be accompanied by a half percentage pointdiscount rate cut and a borrowing target of about $300 million", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I support alternative B withborrowing at $300 million. But along with all the other worries thatI have I must say that I also have the worry that there is at leastsome danger that we could be sowing the seeds for a greaterinflationary problem down the road. It appears to me that at least interms of the price effects, the beneficial effects of the oilsituation may already be behind us. Import prices are rising and arecertainly going to rise more. Indeed, if they don't rise more thechances of getting a correction in the trade balance are diminished.The service sector doesn't look all that hot from a price and wageperformance [perspective]. And like Frank, I am not very slavish onany of the Ms but I can't completely disregard the pace at which allof them seem to be growing, at least at the moment. Partly for thatreason, I am not so keen at this precise moment on the discount ratepart of the package either. I certainly would be keen on it in acontext in which I felt some greater assurance that we might get somesupport abroad. Even aside from that, I guess I am not quite surewhat a discount rate cut does now. Clearly, it reduces debt serviceburdens--not just for LDCs, but for everybody. That is good, if itdoesn't have the perverse effect of encouraging still more debt. Butthe effects of lower interest rates in the short run in terms of theexchange rate, in terms of the trade account, and in terms of stallingthe prospects for growth in Japan and elsewhere, are really bigquestion marks to me. It is just not clear, aside from that debtservicing aspect of it, what a lower discount rate is going to do.And ironically, I suppose, I see some danger that it could have someperverse effects. Now, I think those perverse effects would begreatly minimized in the context in which there was some greaterprospect for movements elsewhere. Unfortunately, that doesn't look sogood. In that setting, if the discount rate has to come down, I-46-8/19/86probably would be inclined to tilt open market operations andborrowings on the up side. We have been rather systematically tiltingoperations on the side of ease and tilting borrowings on the low side.In a setting in which the discount rate were reduced, absent movesabroad, I would be inclined to reverse the tilts", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I favor alternative B with the viewthat we ought to stay about where we are with respect to the growth inthe aggregates. I expect that the economy is going to turn out to bevery difficult to get a grip on. And I would agree with some of theviews expressed earlier that we don't need a discount rate cut fordomestic reasons. I don't see what it will do to improve oursituation domestically. However, I think the argument for reducingthe discount rate to prod the Europeans and the Japanese to stimulatetheir economies is an important one. That turnaround in net exportsat the present time is probably very crucial to maintaining asatisfactory rate of expansion in our domestic economy and in my viewthe way to move in that direction would be to reduce the discount ratealong with alternative B. No one wants to add to liquidity in theeconomy right now, but I think the risks of not trying to do somethingto affect the trade sector are great enough to assume the risks thatgo along with expanding the liquidity in the economy and so forth", "MR. ANGELL. I am very sure that monetary policy does matter.That's why it's such a difficult call here. I don't share the notionthat it doesn't make any difference; I think it makes a great deal ofdifference. It seems to me that we have more balanced risks to worryabout this time than I [saw earlier]. I don't like easing in the faceof the monetary aggregates being where they are. I don't like easing-47-8/19/86when I have a sense that commodity price developments suggest anotheroutlook. At the same time, I think there is a greater risk that this[economy] could deteriorate further on us and compound governmentrevenue [problems] by growing at a rather anemic rate. I think that'sa pretty dangerous risk. I think there is a dangerous risk in thatthe world trade pattern is still stagnant, not expanding. I thinkthat Tom Melzer and Gary Stern are right when they say that inflationexpectations have changed. But that's what worries me on the otherside, because I see inflation expectations rising and the rate ofinflation not rising. And that tends to cause me to believe thatoutput is going to be slow, not fast. So, given this severedifficulty, I am very hesitant about being on the side of an easierstance which could best be accomplished by a discount rate cut andleaving borrowing at $300 million. But I do believe that we are in aplace where if we do get some indication that prices are moving toohigh that we then have to be prepared to take the next step--whichwould be to say that discount rates can go up as well as down. I havevery little faith that we are going to be so accurate as to get thisthing tuned just right without overshooting, but I am afraid not totake the steps. So I am reluctantly for easing", "MR. HELLER. I think I can't wait any longer here. Listeningto the discussion, it's just about evenly divided between the discountrate cutters and noncutters. I think that shows how tough the job isgoing to be. As far as monetary policy is concerned, I think it'svery important to preserve the credibility of the Federal Reserve, tostick to preannounced targets and not to get out of the target ranges.The A alternative gets awfully close--if only I had my bifocals--tothe line that I would really like to stay a bit below. I would agreevery much with the discussion around the table about alternative B.As far as the discount rate is concerned, as I look at the economy, Idon't see that much strength in the immediate future. Given consumerspending and the high consumer debt levels that are already there andthe prospect of not having these consumer debts tax deductible in thefuture, I think consumer spending will be soft during the coming year.On the investment side, I certainly don't see any prospects for sharpincreases in investment and the fiscal picture, with the tax reform,would support that view. On the trade balance, as I said earlier, Iam not quite as optimistic as the forecasts that have been made by thestaff. It clearly will improve, but I think it will be very roughgoing, especially in Europe. Therefore, largely for the internationalreasons that also were cited by Mr. Rice, I would favor a discountrate cut at the present time", "MR. WALLICH. As I look at the longer run, I am moreconcerned about the inflationary effects of this--what it might bewith a 6-year [unintelligible]. So I would go with the monetaristsand say we cannot go on with the M1 and M2 growth that we have beenhaving. That just can't go on indefinitely. Easing, by the same8/19/86token, presents an element of risk. So regretfully, I think that wehave to work at the present level of operation", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we are prepared for going to 2 DMor 150 yen, but if it went suddenly beyond that I would get worried", " I would expectnobody to follow us this time and--MR. MELZER. I didn't mean that. I mean about whether or notwe would do a discount rate cut--that perhaps there were otherdiscussions that had to take place in an international context", "MR. BLACK. You meant to exclude the special borrowing inOklahoma from the $200 million, Mr. Chairman", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that is consistent with yourexpressed view and the views of several other members of theCommittee. But I don't detect that that will command unanimoussupport; if it does, then that's what we ought to say", "MR ANGELL. It won't get a majority", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just leave it at $300 million and what.The problem with that is that people feel differently about whetherthere should be a discount rate cut or not", "8/19/86CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the alternative is leaving it at$300 million regardless of whether we reduce the discount rate. Thatis a theoretical alternative", "MR. MELZER. I would be happy with that if there were a callat the time. Wouldn't it raise the question as to what to do with theborrowing level at that time", " I don't think--MR. BLACK. You're giving up the $400 million possibility ifyou vote for that"], "1986FOMC19860923meeting.txt": [" As the dollar is weakening against the DM, the DM is tending tostrengthen against all currencies, particularly the EMS currencies.And, as I said, they sold $4-1/2 billion worth of DM last week andthat begins to hurt them. So, they are the ones who have beenpressing, I suspect, for these understandings on the jointintervention--that efforts should be made in order to prevent afurther sliding of the dollar, not that we should let go. At leastthat's the way I interpret it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They get a lot of pressure within Europewhen the Germans don't reduce their interest rates; that is one way ofreading it. Nobody wants a revaluation within Europe so they weredriven to this intervention idea as a method of relieving pressurewithin Europe against the general background of concern about thedollar. But that's not what led to that particular decision", "MR. RICE. Not necessarily", "MR. JOHNSON. If we run into a $90 billion problem we mightas well turn in our badge", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have no objection to buying long-termsecurities when there's a good reason for buying them. My question iswhether any particular purpose is served when there's no reason to buythem. I think you want to argue that this [routine buying] keeps themachinery oiled or something. That's the argument", " I think the idea that we control a long-termposition by not rolling over completely all of the maturing issues--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Certainly, that helps you", "MR. ANGELL. It seems to me that if we do not want to sell,and that presumably is the consensus, we ought not to buy as long-termas we've been buying. That would maintain more liquidity. If you cannever sell then there is merit in shortening the maturities that youdo buy", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But we might have argued we were going tobuy anyway and with the long-term rates backing up and the new rate[unintelligible] it might have been quite reasonable to have boughtlong-term securities. Now, would we have been better off or worse offif we had decided in the last few weeks to do that against thebackground of a reserve need when we had no purpose--just a matter ofhaving been in there and only been in for periods of that sort.That's an arguable point", " Yes, the coupon holdings would tend toshorten on this rollover--MR. HELLER. So you're taking about every two years or soanother 5 percentage points up there", "MR. STERNLIGHT. By not taking as much of the long options", "MR. GUFFEY. Yes, on new issues", "MR. PARRY. The other issue is on net exports. You haveroughly a $17 billion growth in the second half coming from netexports. Going to the July data again, the fact that you get animprovement of roughly $7 billion in the third quarter looks a littlesuspect at this point", "MR. PARRY. I get the impression that your level ofconfidence is not the highest on that one", "MR. FORRESTAL. Yes", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, our view of the near-term outlookis still pretty close to that of the staff. This upward revision ingrowth of GNP in the second half makes sense to us in view of thedomestic automobile sales incentives and what appears to be someimprovement in the manufacturing sector in general. I think thelonger-term prospects are a little harder to call. We're stillgenerally optimistic and we think the staff is perhaps about right inprojecting a moderate 3 percent rate of growth for next year. Infact, we tend to think that consumer spending and probably businessfixed investment might be a tad stronger. One reason is that we don'tthink there will be quite as much of an increase in the cost ofcapital and, therefore, that the new tax law will be less damaging tocapital spending than some economists believe--if you take intoconsideration that the top corporate tax rate has come down and alsoconsider what has happened to individual income tax rates of dividendrecipients.But all of this depends, I think, on interest rates andinflation remaining relatively stable. And I think the risks haveincreased that such might not be the case on both fronts. Inparticular, the prospect for progress in reducing the federal deficitlooks a lot less favorable now. I think the financial markets sensethis and that's one of the reasons we had the recent backup ininterest rates, which probably affected the decline in the stockprices. The markets also are clearly more concerned now about thepossibility of a revival of inflation and neither of these kinds of[developments] is good for the markets and neither is good for the-17-9/23/86economy. I hope we'll do everything we can to keep these things fromgaining momentum", "MR. PARRY. The economic situation in the Twelfth District isbasically unchanged from the last meeting, but I think there are a fewmore signs of strength in the District. In August, growth ofemployment in California was very rapid. And the July-over-Julyincrease for the entire District, which of course includes 9 states,was a full percentage point greater than the national average, withonly Alaska and Oregon being under that average. Even in a few of theproblems areas of the District we see some glimmers of greaterstrength. The mining industry got a boost recently in Utah with thesigning of a 4-year contract by Kennecott with the mining union thatis going to result in a resumption of production and will probably addabout 2,000 workers between now and the middle of next year. Thelumber industry is doing quite well at the present time. It has beenhelped by several developments, including strong domestic demand forlumber and a 22 percent increase in exports in the first half.There's also an industry strike in British Columbia which is affectingthe Pacific Coast lumber industry positively. And there is anexpectation, in the industry at least, that the International TradeCommission is going to find that British Columbia has subsidized soft-wood exports and that that's going to accrue to our benefit. On thenegative side, as far as the District is concerned, most of the talkcenters around the tax bill and is basically in line with what SiKeehn mentioned.Our forecast is similar to that of the Board staff's with theexception that we don't have quite the same pattern for net exportsand inventories, particularly in the second half of 1986, and forinflation over the entire period. We agree that the trade account islikely to be an important source of growth in 1987 but we are not veryconfident that the turnaround will occur in the third quarter or thatwe'll get as much strength in the entire second half as indicated bythe Board's forecast. We looked at some data that we have for PacificCoast customs districts, which represent about 25 percent of alltrade. Those data have a lot of problems, including the fact thatthey are nominal--we don't have any deflators in them--but they doindicate that the trade balance has deteriorated consistently throughJuly. It appears as though that deterioration is a result of greaterimports from Canada, Mexico, and perhaps also the Pacific Basin mix.In the inventory area, we see more strength in the third quarter andperhaps a little less in the fourth. I must admit that thecontribution to growth of $25.8 billion in the fourth quarter in theBoard's forecast is quite a bit more than we have. Also, we do nothave such a sharp fall-off--going from 5.6 to 0.9 percent--in finalsales. So, there's quite a difference in pattern but we end up with areal GNP growth which is not that much different for the second half.Finally, I have a somewhat greater concern about inflation through1987 than is in the Board staff's forecast. We talked about that alittle in the discussion. I think there is a chance that we'll seemore of an effect in other sectors of the passthrough of the higherdollar cost of imports. I also wonder if the growth rate of theeconomy, averaging 3 percent between now and the end of 1987, would9/23/86enable producers to pass along larger price increases than areincorporated in the Board staff's forecast. As a result, ourinflation rates have a tendency to be running about a percentage pointhigher than those shown by the Board staff", "MR. PARRY. Yes", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I think the staff's forecast is agood one. I expect, as they do, that the economy will pick up in thisquarter and in the fourth quarter. However, I can't help noting someareas of concern. The first is that the two areas of strength in theeconomy--consumption spending and single-family residentialconstruction--while likely to maintain their strength, will becontributing less to the economy. That is, their rate of growth willbe decelerating and residential construction in the single-family areawill be offset by what's happening in multifamily housingconstruction. And I'm mindful that the two components that we arerelying on to provide this pickup--that is, inventory accumulation andan improvement in the external accounts--are areas that in the pasthave proven difficult to forecast. As has been pointed out, we maynot see the degree of improvement in these components that we wouldhope for. Therefore, I would see the risks of the forecast on thedown side. I'm gratified, however, by the recent evidence ofimprovement in the economy, particularly in the employment area, andalso by the anecdotal evidence that has come in. There seems to be animproved sentiment in the business community as well. But I do seethe risks at this point on the down side", "MR. BOEHNE. The District continues to operate at a higherlevel of business activity than the nation as a whole. Just oneindicator of that is unemployment, which for the District as a whole-20-9/23/86has been running around 6 percent and around Philadelphia closer to 5percent. But we have noticed in the last couple of months that therate of change has slowed somewhat. That has not affected attitudes,however, which I think are generally upbeat because of the higherlevel. While people don't feel great about the future, they thinkit's pretty good.As I look at the national economy, I do think that thestatistics have improved a touch. I'm not sure how much I would makeof that but I think that is there. Largely because of the foreignsector, how the economy in fact will turn out is very tough to call.As a result, my convictions, and I sense the convictions of others, donot run very deep about the economic outlook. I think we see thismore dramatically in the financial markets, which seem to act onchanges in sentiment, more than on the goods side. There is thatlevel of uncertainly and lack of conviction as to where we're going.On the inflation side, I sense that there has been perhaps more than asubtle change--that the concern about inflation as expressed in thelong bond market, and to some extent in the commodities market, isthere. And I think the message there for those of us who makemonetary policy is that perhaps we have run into some resistance pointon what we can do. Trying to bring all that down to a bottom line, Iwould come out about where the staff is as far as numbers; but I wouldemphasize that there's not a whole lot of conviction that lies behindthose numbers", "MR. FORRESTAL. Looking first at the District, I think Icould say, Mr. Chairman, that conditions in the Southeast reflectpretty much the imbalances that we see in the rest of the economy.The energy states are especially weak, particularly Louisiana. We'reseeing a lot of out-migration from that state to other states,particularly Mississippi, and that's causing unemployment rates inthose states to move up as well. We now have the distinction, dubiousas it may be, of having the highest unemployment rate in two states--in Louisiana and Mississippi it's over 13 percent. The agriculturalsector is also in bad shape, partly as a result of the drought that Ireported on before. We have had some recent rains in the area butthey've come too late to help most crops. The corn and soybean cropsare destroyed. We've had some marginal benefit to some other cropsfrom that rain. The apparel and textile producers still are reportingthat they're not getting any particular benefit from the decline inthe dollar. They still say that foreign competition is coming in verystrongly and, of course, they are continuing their protectionistcries, particularly from Congressman Jenkins. And I think we'll hearmore of this bill that the President vetoed. At the same time, someof the apparel and textile people who have tried to carve a particularniche in the market are doing better, particularly those who have notonly carved that niche but have improved their productivity throughgreater automation. So it's a mixed picture in that industry; Iwouldn't say that it's completely negative.General business conditions continue to be very good in theurban areas, and this has given rise to more and more talk in a numberof states in the District of this dichotomy that somebody else hastalked about--where we have the rural areas not participating in thegeneral beneficial economic conditions and the urban areas doing quite-21-9/23/86well. That seems to be consistent throughout the entire District. Wehave seen a leveling off of single-family housing, but it's still atfairly high levels and I think will continue to be a source ofstrength in the local economy. Business attitudes are still fairlypositive, although I detect on the part of some people I've talked toa waning of confidence just a bit. That's particularly related touncertainties about the tax bill and the trade sector. Interestinglythough, I don't hear at all any concerns about recession in theDistrict; and I don't hear very much concern about inflation,notwithstanding what the markets seem to be telling us.On the national level, I agree generally with the staffforecast. I might have some marginal difference with respect tounemployment, as I indicated earlier, and perhaps to inflation. Butthose are very minor differences. I, too, would share the greatuncertainty that others feel about the direction of the trade deficitand what that means for overall economic activity in 1987. But ingeneral, I think the forecast is on target. And we can only hope thatthe trade deficit will turn around in a short period of time", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, on the national level I'd beslightly less optimistic than the staff's forecast, but it's prettyclose. On the District level, I'm having a little change of heart; Ithink my attitude is changing from one of pessimism to cautiousoptimism. I don't want to damn this by faint praise but I, too, thinkthat we are seeing signs that we may be reaching the trough in theEleventh District. The big increases in unemployment rates seem to beover. In Texas, in both July and August, rates were below the ratesfor May and June. Those July and August rates, however, were veryhigh: August was 9.2 percent compared with the 6.8 percent nationalaverage, but that's down from the 10+ percent that we had a littleearlier. Unemployment rates [are high] in Louisiana; Bob Forrestalmentioned that. New Mexico is about the same as Texas. Our nonfarmemployment may be near the end of its major decline. We did see alittle rise in July in Texas and New Mexico and that comes after fiveconsecutive months of decline. So, hopefully, we're seeing a turnthere. The manufacturing sector remains weak but may be close tobottoming out. Some areas of strength we're seeing include electricaland electronic equipment as well as aircraft and parts. Ourconstruction contracts seems to be stabilizing, at least for now.Construction values remain about 20 percent below year-ago levels.The most pronounced reduction in the energy sector activity alsoappears to be behind us. Our rig count is flat or rising slightly--from very low levels, of course. Our energy sector employment now isdeclining slowly in contrast to massive layoffs just a few months ago.Even in agriculture, the livestock producers are feeling a littlebetter because of higher beef prices. So in summary, Mr. Chairman, Iwould say that maybe we have a little cautious optimism for theEleventh District now", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the Tenth DistrictI'm not sure that the cautious optimism is present. The District as awhole, as I think the Committee knows, has not performed as well overthe past year or two as the national economy--measured by either total9/23/86employment or unemployment numbers, personal income gains, and thingsof that nature. There is the difference between the urban and therural that I've spoken of before. However, in my most recent meetingswith businessmen, I found the views of urban businessmen across afairly wide range of activities a bit more pessimistic than in thepast. That is to say, they understand that the economy even in theurban areas is operating at a fairly low level, but they don't haveany great optimism that there is any light at the end of the tunnelthat gives them much hope that it's going to improve over the nearterm. That seems to me to be a bit of a change. The other side ofthat coin is that they have apparently no concern, or little concern,that inflation or inflationary expectations will be revived. As aresult, in the urban areas activity is rocking along at kind of anunsatisfactory rate but at least on the positive side.On the agricultural side on the other hand, there is verylittle improvement other than in the areas Bob Boykin just referredto--that is, in the red meat sector prices of both hogs and cattlehave come up and are at very good levels. There are good profitmargins simply because the [cost of] feed that is necessary to putthose animals to market is less; as a result the profit margins in redmeat industries are very good. If you look at net farm income,however, you could build a fairly good case that it will be about thesame level in 1986 as it was in 1985. If you look a little deeper youwill find, however, that the net farm income is largely attributableto government programs. It's merely a transfer from the federalTreasury to the producers that gives you net farm income that isnearly equal to last year. On the other hand, the net exports ofagricultural products will be at the lowest level in 20 years. Wewill have a net export position of agricultural products that issomething over $7 billion; a couple of years ago that was in the $30billion range. So, the impact of the dollar hasn't hit, and probablywon't hit, in that sector simply because there is production beyondthe U.S. boundaries that is supplying the demand that we used tosupply. So the outlook in the farm area is not very bright.In the energy area, much as Bob Boykin has indicated, thereis a little activity but there's still a great reluctance to do verymuch exploration simply because of the uncertainty of what OPEC'simpact will be on energy prices. They are afraid not that the oilprice will go to $20 but rather that it will go back down to $8 or $10and they will be in the midst of drilling a well that will not pay offif they are successful in hitting oil. So, overall, the District isrocking along at a very low level. But in a sense the tenor seemspositive, except for the foreclosures in the agricultural sector andthe lack of activity in the energy sector", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. In terms of the general outlook, I'dpiggy-back on a comment Mr. Stern made earlier: my GNP forecast onbalance looks a lot like the staff's but it looks that waynotwithstanding the fact that we have a smaller improvement in thetrade deficit than is in the Greenbook. On the trade deficitquestion, I have been on the skeptical side in terms of the rate atwhich that could turn around, and I still am. But for what it isworth, our people did a little informal survey this past week of across section of a couple dozen firms, major and minor; and for thefirst time that survey does suggest some things that are consistentwith at least a stabilization, if not some improvement, on the tradeside. It comes through both in terms of export opportunities beingthere in ways that they were not there before and in terms of importprice pressures beginning to work their way in. One of the surprisingthings we found in the process of doing this survey--at leastsurprising to me--was the emphasis that people on both sides put oncommitments and long lags in orders and processing. One example ofthat was even in soft goods--clothing and that type of thing. Thelags are a year or more, growing out of commitments and contractualobligations that are standing in the way of adjustments being madeeven in the face of more favorable conditions. Now, there is nothingspectacular there--no hard evidence--but at least it is a bit of anindication that maybe the tide is turning, notwithstanding thehorrible July number and the prospect for the third quarter as a wholestill probably being pretty lousy.On the inflation side, I have some of the same concerns thatBob Parry and Tom Melzer talked about. Our forecast is one in whichwe have the inflation rate roughly a half percentage point higher thanwhat is in the Greenbook. In some sense that is not altogetheralarming, but what bothers me is that it wouldn't take a whole heck ofa lot to make me want to mark up that price forecast. Looking around,one of the things that really has disturbed me of late is this patternthat we see in domestic automobile prices--Ford, I guess it was, lastweek announcing price increases on domestic models of up to 9 percent.In the context of the anecdotal reports that people have referred to,I think that is, to some extent, a matter of concern. In the staffforecast, by the end of next year they have the CPI, excluding energy,at 4-1/2 percent. I don't know what the threshold is but my hunch isthat if that were above 5 percent, or if the deflator were above 4-25-9/23/86percent, we would have a very, very difficult situation on our handsby the end of next year. In that setting I, too, don't think thatwhat we are seeing in the financial markets is completely irrational.There is some basis for concern there, notwithstanding the fact that,as Emmett Rice and others have said, there are some downside risks inthe economy itself. It goes without saying that these patterns thatwe have seen in the last couple of weeks in the financial marketsserve as a reminder of the vulnerabilities that are there--whether interms of just volatility or these very, very sharp changes infinancial asset prices over periods of weeks and months. That initself has the potential to undermine confidence in ways that could bequite counterproductive in terms of economic performance. So, I can'tdisregard what the financial markets are doing at all, and I thinkwhat they are saying is that you better be careful here boys", "MS. HORN. Well, taking off on that lead, the numbers in theCleveland forecast look quite a bit like the Greenbook forecast. Butperhaps, whereas I sense from the Greenbook that the Board staff tendsto look at those numbers and see the glass as half full, I see theglass as half empty. I suppose that is a result number one, of thesituation in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, and number two, ofmy growing disappointment that the expectations I had earlier in theyear for lower interest rates, a higher stock market, and low oilprices coming through haven't yet materialized. Or, if they havematerialized, they haven't been in the quantity that I expected.From the Fourth District vantage point I am unable to reportdevelopments that suggest a step-up in the pace of expansion over thebalance of the year. The flat economy has meant a flat capital goodsmarket and that is key for the Fourth District. Given that, togetherwith strong competition from imports, many District producers--notablyof steel--are tempering their optimism and are starting another waveof restructuring and serious consideration of cost cutting. I seethis attitude not only in steel, but in autos, auto-relatedindustries, machine tools--what is left of them--and machinery-makingin general. Although we are not talking about declining production--things aren't that bad--we are talking about decreasing market sharesin intense competition. All of that is making people think aboutsurvival: about shutting down less efficient facilities and basicallyconsolidating and down-scaling operations generally. I don't thinkthe mood is bleak, but I think there is much less optimism on futuresmarkets and the future ability to gain market share than there was,say, a year ago when there was more hope for what the exchange ratewould do for our world in the Fourth Federal Reserve District. So, Iwould say that in this next year in the industrial Midwest--or what isleft of it--we would have a turbulent time, with the next steps beingtoward restructuring.Businessmen and the directors in our District talk more andmore about their disappointment with the budget process. I am notsure how to evaluate that because there are the two sides--one is thedeficit reduction and the other is the tax increase they are about tobe hit with, or may be about to be hit with. That is something that Ihear talked about more and more as time passes. I think the overall9/23/86effect of these factors is working in the direction of weakening thefoundation for the expansion next year. With the additional drag oncapital goods that we will see from the tax package, I see littlelikelihood of a strengthening in the traditional capital goods market.I don't yet detect nervousness about inflation; people seem preparedto watch prices go up and attribute that to the end of the oil pricecontribution to the indices. Cost control efforts really are alreadyintense and they will intensify. One could argue on the good sidefrom that, but even among businessmen I find skepticism from pushingtoo hard or relying on that on the inflation front. Of course, on theinflation front, if the deficit is not going to be brought down thenthe load will fall once again on monetary policy", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know about those wage increases;those wage increases are low but so is productivity", "MS. SEGER. I have just a couple of comments since I haveheard just about everything said that I was going to say. In general,I am probably a hair more pessimistic than the staff, primarilybecause when I look at the auto industry I just have a feeling that weare going to give back more next year than the staff is assuming. Iam impressed with the current sales level--no doubt about that--which,I guess, shows what low interest rates will do and how inattentive alot of consumers are. But I think that this is not all a net gain. Ithink the give-back will show up, particularly in the first quarter.Also, I am just very nervous about the impact of tax reform on a wholelot of things, but particularly on business spending on new plant andequipment and on office buildings which, of course, are already underthe gun. I think that is just going to provide one more discouraginginfluence.We have been talking about this trade turnaround for a numberof months and expecting that to provide quite a bit of support for theeconomy, and I certainly hope that happens. But Senator Riegle sentme a little story which, with your permission I would like to tell,because I think it demonstrates how difficult it is to turn off theimport competition. This involves one of his constituent companiesout in Michigan; they produce Being non-mechanical, I have no idea what those are, by the way, but apparentlythey are very important in the production of engines. The companysupplies parts for about three-fourths of the engines produced in thiscountry and the Japanese had been their primary competition. Theyhave revamped their entire operation, they have spent heavily on R&Dand on new equipment, etc., they have gotten wage concessions, andthey have tried to imitate the Japanese in the labor-managementrelationship. They have done remarkably well in dealing with theJapanese [competition] and they are now selling their main part for$5.50. Now, all of a sudden, the Koreans are calling on their majorcustomers in this country and are offering them very similar productsat $3.50. This isn't something I picked up; it came from Don Riegle.But I think it is very indicative of how tough this job is going tobe, particularly when we haven't seen the dollar deteriorate vis-a-visthe Korean currency. I just hope and pray that we can get somemovement in the currencies of these newly industrialized countries,particularly in the Far East, or I don't think we are going to seethis big turnaround that we are counting on. Thank you", "MR. JOHNSON. That is right. My own views are not that muchdifferent from the staff's, either. I am a little more pessimistic onthe trade side. And looking a little further down the road in 1987, Iworry about how this automobile situation is finally going to workitself out. They are making a big contribution in sales this quarter,which is going to drain inventory and have a fairly neutral effect onGNP. Even in the fourth quarter, it appears that their inventoriesare going to build back up because the incentive programs will go offand demand will slide. What comes after that is somewhat of aconcern. Are they going to cut prices, which doesn't appear to be thecase, or are they going to build in deeper incentive programs. Howmuch have they borrowed from the future. My concern is that there maybe some bigger production cutbacks ahead in autos, perhaps in the 1987period. The numbers are working out about right for 1986, it appears.The third-quarter trade just doesn't look like it is going tomeet our expectations, at least if the July numbers are half correct.I realize there is a gold sale phenomenon in the accounts but thatdoes not make me feel that comfortable. So I am a little morepessimistic, but I do see a turnaround. I don't think you can have adepreciation of the dollar of around 40 percent against the majorindustrial countries' currencies and not see some improvement. Ithink that we are getting close to the peak of the trade deficit andthat some improvement will start showing up. If it just stoppedincreasing, we could see a good improvement in the GNP growth rate. Iam a little concerned, too, as I have mentioned before, about some ofthe changed environment in the financial sector. I do think a lot ofit is associated with the turmoil over who is going to contribute toworld growth. There has been a good bit of expectation developingabout interest rate reductions in Europe and Japan, which haven'tmaterialized. That has added to the argument of some policy makers inthe United States that the only way to solve the trade deficit, as aresult of this resistance, is through an ever lower dollar.Obviously, that is going to create some anticipation in the financialmarkets that trying to solve the trade deficit through a substantiallyweaker dollar ultimately could be inflationary. I think that is afactor contributing to the turmoil of financial markets. Hopefully,if growth is stronger in Europe than we are thinking that will improvethe situation and calm the environment a bit and exports will pick up.I think that is the only thing that ultimately is going to calm thatenvironment. The outlook doesn't look that good in Japan; I think wehave to place most of our hopes on Europe and hope that Germany isright unless they are planning to reduce their interest rates a littlelater. Maybe this European exercise to support the dollar will helpbut I am still concerned about the mechanics of that and how that'sall going to work out. That is my two cents", "MR. PARRY. Alternative B would be my choice. We have beenexpecting the fundamentals to produce a pickup in economic activity,and it appears from the recent data that that is occurring. At the9/23/86same time, I think financial markets are concerned about inflation andthe effects of a particularly easier policy on long-term rates and thevalue of the dollar would be adverse at this point. I share Tom'sconcern about overshooting our targets for M2 and M3. If I had tointroduce a nuance, it would be at least in terms of verbiage leaningslightly toward greater restrictiveness", "MR. BOYKIN. My view is the same, \"B", "MR. GUFFEY.

I share some of those feelings, but if we are going torock along at 2-1/2 or 3 percent growth, I would hate to be focusingon M2 and M3 going marginally above the top of their range and takesome action to tighten up. So, I conclude that \"B\" is the appropriatecourse now and I would not be very receptive to any movement in theperiod ahead if M2 and M3 are going to exceed their targets in just amarginal way", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Since about March orApril we have tended to fall a trifle shy of that $900 million level.And now we think that maybe the demand was augmented somewhat in theearly months of this year by some seasonal factors. So, I'm notconvinced of any basic decline in the demand for excess reserves. Ithink it has probably leveled off and what we are seeing now is just alittle resistance for seasonal reasons.

Anyhow, I think it does suggestthat there's some urgency here to move people into these emptybuildings. Again, that didn't make me feel terribly good. And that'swithout even considering the tax reform items. I really think thatthe tax reform is going to hit the multifamily or the apartment areaprobably as hard as any sector of the economy. It's sure going toknock off some of these limited partnerships that have been used tofinance them. And for offices the same is true: there are lots ofvacancies and it's very difficult to unload space. I don't believeI've heard it mentioned at the table here but there's a real problemcoming up with hotels because so many have been built. It's not justin Washington, D.C. where all the lobbyists control them, but in manyparts of the country there has been a lot of hotel construction andit's reaching the point where there is an excess of rooms and somereal downward pressure on plans to put up additional hotels. Finally,in relying heavily on the trade turnaround I certainly hope that ittakes place. I've heard some stories about additional orders forAmerican exporters or soundings on the possibility of additionalexport business. But I also continue to hear stories about howdifficult it is to meet the import competition from the countries thatwe seem to ignore, countries like Canada and Korea and Hong Kong. Andit seems to me that if we're going to close this gap we've got toaddress both sides--not just expand our exports but put a damper onour imports. I'm not talking about trade restrictions, believe me.But I don't see a lot of evidence that the import surge is slowingdown. So I guess I'm just generally negative today", "MR. PRELL. Well, I'm not sure we can. One thing that may bea source of concern about that measurement is the treatment of vacantunits. They evidently make some adjustments for the discontinuousmovements in rents that occur after units have been vacated. While wecan't manage to get into the details of how they're actually doingthese adjustments we think there could be some upward bias in themeasurement of rent increases recently", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Right at themoment, I'm kind of on this [unintelligible] curve. I can't refrainfrom saying that there are two things that bother me, looking at alonger-term prospective, that are particularly relevant to what we donow. I am struck, particularly [by the comments of] the first peoplewho were talking, that we are doing much better on wages. Mr. Prell-24-11/5/86and other people tell us that it really has been quite remarkable.Productivity in manufacturing, at least, seems to be pretty good.They are keeping their costs under control and everybody says all ofthese manufacturers are sitting there champing at the bit to raiseprices. They can't do it, but at the first opportunity that comesalong they are going to raise prices. I just wonder about theconsistency of these things and what they tell us about the psychologyof the American business sector. You have twenty years of inflation,that's normal; and if you can't raise prices that's not normal, evenif you are making production gains and keeping your costs undercontrol. There seems to be something the matter there. Then I hearabout all of these capacity cutbacks--I don't want to generalize toofar, maybe it's just in orders on steel--but if we are going to havethese high exports in the future and we are going to have theserestrained imports that we are talking about, presumably that meansmanufacturing activity does a lot better in the United States. Iwould think some of that improvement in the trade balance has to comein the automobile industry.

So in terms ofwhat we have for 1987, we are essentially growing a half point fasterthan that; given our translation, it is really worth 1/2 point or so.What, indeed, is the trend growth of productivity. The more recentnumbers have been rather disappointing, closer to 1 percent ratherthan what we had thought--1-1/4 percent or even higher. So I think itis an open case at the moment. I don't view this as terribly out ofline with our sense of potential growth in the economy. I suspectthere are folks who have numbers all over the lot. Some outsideforecasts [show unemployment] down to 6-1/2 percent; others have 3percent growth and unemployment rates rising. So there is a good dealof variability", "MR. KICHLINE.

So, we aregetting strong productivity gains; that is important in this forecast.In terms of potential growth, we are trying to look at trendproductivity for the economy in total, but there is a great deal ofvariation among sectors", "MR. KICHLINE. The number floating around that is stillpreliminary, I think, is $163 billion for the current fiscal year.That's still subject to change but it's in the $160-$165 billion area.Keep in mind: that is the same number that just a matter of a fewmonths ago was $143 billion; so they have added $20 billion. It's acase of how much you want to up the ante. We have added another $20billion. I think there is a danger of going too far in thatdirection, because there were legislative changes enacted that willbegin to bite. One of the issues relates to defense. We had a lot ofdefense spending in the second and third quarters of last year. It isour sense that the level of that spending is now quite high. We havehad major weapons systems deliveries that are now coming in; they areproducing these things at a very rapid rate. But we don't expectdefense spending to continue to grow in real terms at a fast clip.Rather we expect, as we get into the first part of next year, that wewill probably have constraints on defense spending--in part becauseappropriations were cut back at the Administration's request. I wouldsay that if we are wrong, I would probably add more; that is the safeway to go now. A big question mark is the agricultural area; we havesubstantially more dollars in there than does the Administration. Myexperience over the years is that even when we do that we are alwayslow. It looks sort of outrageous but basically it turns out to be areally important issue. I think it is too pessimistic to say thatthings weren't done. I think they were done.

Thathas been a hot area--particularly the real estate, where there hasbeen a lot of employment and maybe there has been some bidding up ofwages.

I would hate to get into the samesituation we got into this year with Ml. That could really constrainthe markets quite a bit at the beginning of the year--if we set atarget assuming another stable pattern of velocity for the year andend up with something [close to this year]. There just seems to betoo much uncertainty about it, period. The study even indicates thatthere is so much uncertainty around Ml that it doesn't seem to haveany great advantage.

I don't see much point in setting a range for Mlbecause it has been misbehaving so badly. We could simply omit therange but I think it would be worthwhile if we substituted a range forM1A. I know there are problems with trying to target M1A, just likethere are problems with any of the other aggregates; but the long-runinterest elasticity of M1A reported in the staff paper is low enoughto make it, I think, technically feasible to set a range of 4 to 5percentage points [in width], which is what we have done customarily.It seems to me likely that the interest elasticity of M1A will remainrelatively stable even if the depository institutions began to adjusttheir deposit rates more flexibly in response to changes in marketrates.

Also, if we get to the point that we need to tighten up,we are going to need something to [unintelligible]. Remembering backto October 6, 1979, I think a lot of people voted for targeting theaggregates because they thought it provided an excuse to raiseinterest rates more than they otherwise could get away with; and Ithink this kind of aggregate target could be extremely useful in thatcapacity when that time comes, if it ever comes", "MR. BLACK. I was going to ask Mr. Kohn what he thinks itought to be", "MR. ANGELL.

If so, at a latermoment in the year you may want to set new targets.

Unfortunately, my view is the same as it was lastJuly--which was that we should not publish an M1 target range becausethe aggregate was behaving so weirdly. I felt that it would--and as amatter of fact it did--confuse the financial markets and marketparticipants, regardless of how many qualifications we put out with itand despite our saying that we were not paying as much attention to itas we used to. As long as it can be graphically presented everyFriday by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, people willpay attention to it. Those footnotes don't get transmitted becausenewspapers don't transmit everything and the readers don't want all ofthat baggage. They are looking for easy answers.

I would publish an M2and M3 range", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, if I read Mr. Corrigan and some ofthe others who have spoken up for a monitoring range correctly, itreflects a feeling that at some point in time we may face another 1979situation and that at that point we will be able to resurrect M1 againand pursue a more restrictive policy than we otherwise would have beenable to do because of the mystique attached to Ml. I think that's nota very realistic proposition. I think Ml did have that kind ofmystique in 1979 but it certainly doesn't have it now. If we go tothe Congress and say we can't have M1 growing more than 9 percent,they are going to say: Well, you let it grow at 15 percent in 1986 andin 4 out of 5 years in the 1980s you didn't meet your target andnothing happened. Why do you think you have to meet an M1 target thisyear. I don't think you can put M1 back in the box and pull it outthat easily anymore", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Stern", "MS. HORN. Mr. Chairman, I am with those who think we shouldnot set a target range for Ml but I suppose, in the end, a monitoringrange is a possibility. The words that we associate with what we dowith M1--and for that matter with monetary targeting in general--I12/15-16/86think are very important. And I would like to see some words thatmaybe go back a bit to Bob Black's point about the targeting ofinflation, or just some words that say monetary targeting is not anobjective of the Federal Reserve System--that whether it's Ml, M2 orM3, we are not expecting to control the aggregates, but we are settingranges that we think are consistent with such and such a pattern ofprices, employment, and total spending. I would indicate that,basically, we began setting target ranges publicly and inCongressional testimony as a way of assuring the Congress and thepublic that we were in fact intent on getting to a certain point withinflation, and that at the moment the connection between monetarytargets and inflation is not what it used to be, and that we aretalking here about what monetary targets we think are consistent withour ultimate objective", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have a range of opinion. I don'tsee anybody saying we should have a target of the traditional type, asopposed to a monitoring range. I will make a couple of observations.I think I am repeating what other people said but--even setting fortha monitoring range the way we did [in July] or as we do for debt Idon't think is very helpful, because we are likely to be either wayabove or, in some conditions, way below. I would hate to be in aposition where every indication was to tighten up and we've got all ofthese interest elasticity [unintelligible]. I'm not particularlyexpecting that in the short run but, over time, we may want to tightenup and if we have great interest elasticity and M1 runs low peoplewill say: You are running below that 5 percent target, how can youpossibly tighten up under those conditions. So I have a real concernin both directions about setting forth a target, even a monitoringrange, just pure and simple.I share some of the concerns about promising too much from astudy. I would suggest that we say we are going to get back to it atmidyear. It seems likely that the study is going to show that almostanything we look at has a lot of interest elasticity and that gives usthe problem that we are not going to be in any position--. Obviously,nobody can oppose a study. It's just a matter of the way it's stated,as Mr. Boehne just said. However, I think we can say something that12/15-16/86would be useful. And that probably would be something along thelines--I haven't quite visualized a box, but that's a subsidiarypoint--that we think we know something about Ml and how it behaves ina very broad way. I think we probably could say something like: undernormal or specified conditions, we would think it would rise at a pacesomewhat around nominal GNP and we think that a nominal GNP--I'm notsure I'd state it quite this way--of around 5-1/2 or 6 percent isappropriate. And if interest rates weren't changing, that's what wewould expect. But if other things happened and interest rates wentup, we would expect M1 to run low, and the public shouldn't besurprised by that; if interest rates were declining and the economywas soft, we would expect M1 to run high. If inflation is down, wewouldn't be disturbed by a higher figure; if inflation is rising andinterest rates are rising, we wouldn't be disturbed by a lower figure.Everyone ought to understand that that's the way we will appraise Ml--as a kind of supplementary device to the other targets, withoutputting it in the box, or setting a monitoring range per se. We mightfootnote it or something. I don't know how much one can say in a box.It's a visual point, but I think we could have a useful discussion ofM1 indicating the kinds of conditions under which we would bedisturbed or not disturbed by a big slowdown or a greater increase.That might be more useful than anything else", "MR. BLACK. Don, how likely do you think it will be thateventually we will get to the point where these rates paid on othercheckable deposits will vary pretty directly with market rates", "MR. KOHN. I think that's possible but, as I indicatedyesterday, I think some of the interest elasticity that we areobserving now may be exaggerated. If the offering rates begin to moveup or down with market rates then we would observe what the elasticityis with respect to market rates. But it's still going to be verysubstitutable, at the margin, with other closely related deposits. Idon't think that we will get back to where we were before", "MR. KOHN. Those wealth variables we have do, I think, havebearing on M2 growth and on the broad aggregates; it makes some sense", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you can argue the opposite on thebasis of your knowledge", "MR. PARRY. Under the assumption of little or no change ininterest rates in 1987 and the kind of nominal growth that isincorporated in the staff's forecast, on the basis of the staff'sanalysis and some analysis that we have done we think we would getgrowth of M2 and M3 at the lower end of the tentative ranges. Infact, we got 5 to 6 percent on M2 and 6 to 7 percent on M3. It seemsto me that one could argue for perhaps a 1/2 percentage pointreduction in the existing tentative targets [for 1987]--to somewherearound 5 to 8 percent", "MR. MORRIS. Well, maybe that's something that we need to getfurther counseling on from Mr. Kohn--[whether his work] indicates thathalf of one percentage point is not a matter of major consequence", "MR. ANGELL. But if you went back a year ago and asked theFOMC what its interest rate forecast was, some of what has happenedmay have been unexpected. It may very well be that we do not knowwhether the economy, for sure, is going to be growing at a 4 percentreal path--or 3 percent, or even 1-1/2 percent", "MR. ANGELL. Well, because I am not so sure that the economywill be growing at a 3 percent real path or a 6 percent nominal path.12/15-16/86It may very well be that we will have been inaccurate or not have beenable to foresee that. We might be on a path that is conducive tolower interest rates; if so, would we want to have an M2 target thatrestrained us and caused us to tighten in an environment in which theeconomy was growing at a real path of, say, 1-1/2 percent and anominal path of 4 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're coming perilously close to havingno target at all. Mr. Keehn", "MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, our forecast is very much likethe Greenbook's and I too would be very happy if we got 2.7 or 2.8percent, whatever it happens to be. But I would repeat what I saidlast month: that I think the risk is on the down side.With respect to the regional economy, developments showcontinued strength in almost all of the urban areas but weakness inthe rural areas, particularly in the agricultural and energy-dependentsectors. Christmas retail sales have been fairly good so far, againin those urban areas, although in a lot of the large urban centersthere has been a rapid proliferation of stores and that has kept theunit gains fairly [modest]. The black spot in our District, ofcourse, is Louisiana, which is basically in a depression. The onlygood news that you can find there at all--if indeed it is good, butyou grasp at almost any straw here--is that the rig count hasstabilized and maybe even picked up a bit. People down there are nowsaying that a $15.00 oil price would be a viable price to begin toaccelerate some exploration. Now, that's a lower price than we haveheard before. The farm sector also is fairly depressed in most areasof the Southeast. We are looking for greater liquidation, mostly dueto the drought that we suffered last summer. More and more farmersare being forced to the wall and land prices continue to plummet inmany areas. In the housing sector, we are finding generally thatsingle-family home construction is picking up in several areas inresponse to sales of new homes. I don't know how that squares withthe latest numbers, but that was the information that we had.Nonresidential construction is off. So it's a very mixed picture, Mr.Chairman, in the Southeast. Despite that, there is still a fairdegree of confidence among most people outside of Louisiana that weare going to have continued expansion in 1987. There is the evidencethat the trade situation is turning around and there is an expectation12/15-16/86on the part of people in the export-related areas that they are goingto see improvement in 1987", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, the Eleventh District has remainedmuch the way it was when we reported at the last meeting. We continueto think that we are at the trough, statistically at least; we thinkthere is going to be some improvement in 1987. We just did our ownforecast for the District and we think we will do about half as wellas the national forecast. That does key off the national forecast,because we think that's where most of our strength is going to be--thespillover effect from that--and we do pretty much agree with thestaff's forecast. Also, if oil prices are in the $13.00 to $16.00range we have a little optimism there, and that's built into ourforecast. We have had a little improvement in non-ag employment inthe District, although the Texas unemployment rate is still holding at9-1/2 percent versus 7 percent for the nation. Of the eight highestunemployment rates [for cities] around the country, we have five ofthem in Texas. It depends on where you happen to be; if you are inMcAllen, Texas it's 19 percent. Agriculture presents a bit of a mixedbag. If you are in the livestock business, it's looking pretty good;if not, it still looks bad or not very encouraging. The high-tech andrelated areas look pretty good.One reason I said that, statistically, we think we are at thetrough is that, anecdotally, we are about the only ones who thinkthat. Comments of our directors and reports from around the Districttend to be more negative in that we get very little encouragement. Intrying to figure out why that is, I think it is probably that ourdirectors don't have the same view of the national economy's growththat we have. In other words, they have a feeling that growth is notgoing to be as strong as we think it will. So, while there is notanything really to brag about openly, we are going to go along andgradually improve", "MR. BLACK. I think the staff's projection for real GNP isstill reasonable both for the fourth quarter and for 1987. Likeeverybody else, we were impressed by the November report onemployment; and I think the staff was right to revise their figures upon that basis. But I really believe that the near-term outlook ismore uncertain than it has been for some little time. It seems thatone month we get a series of good reports and the next month they areall bad; we keep flip-flopping back and forth as these reports comein. But for three reasons, I am now concluding that the risk may beon the down side. One reason is in the foreign trade sector. I amparticularly uneasy about the rapid improvement of the net exports ofgoods and services projected for the fourth quarter by the staff.Even taking account of the likely slant in petroleum imports, I thinkthere's certainly better than an even chance that we are eventuallygoing to see some improvement on the trade side; at the same time,this strong and increasing competition from some of the smaller Asiancountries and rather lackluster performance in the German economy inthe third quarter lead us to think that the improvement might not bequite as great as most people are assuming. I guess it was Bob Parrya while ago who suggested that it might be stronger now, and Icertainly hope that he's right on that. I am a little worried by it.We are disturbed for a second reason by this continueddeceleration in residential [construction] and new home sales; and wegot a new figure that sort of confirmed that this morning. Finally,we are not as confident about the prospects for consumer expendituresas we were at the last meeting.the head of a large department store reportedthat sales had literally dried up right at Thanksgiving, after havingbeen very good before then. This was a nationwide phenomenon ratherthan something simply confined to the area; we get the samekind of reports from other retailers in our area. And I can't helpbut think that some of this strength we are seeing--even in itemsother than automobiles--is an acceleration of purchases by those fewpeople who itemize their sales tax deductions in order to takeadvantage of that this year on big-ticket items before next year whenthe tax is not deductible", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our view is very closeto, and consistent with, the Greenbook forecast. I think that is anacceptable outlook, and I would join those who say that if we achieve12/15-16/862.7 or 2.8 percent growth in the fifth year of recovery, that's apretty good record given the projection for prices.On the regional front, the situation has not changed greatlyfrom what has been reported before--that is, we have an unevenrecovery, with severely depressed conditions in the energy,agricultural, and aircraft sectors of the economy. I suppose we cantake some comfort from the fact that our most recent agriculturalsurvey shows that the decline in agricultural real estate values ismoderating. That is the second quarter in a row in which declineshave averaged only 2 percent, as contrasted with earlier declines of 6to 7 percent in each quarter. Those values now are roughly 50 percentof what they were in 1981 at their highs. I take some comfort fromthe discussion about exports, particularly Ted Truman's indicationyesterday that agricultural exports have picked up. I must tell you,however, that we don't see any of that activity in the Tenth District.As a matter of fact, the crop this year has been a bumper cropvirtually across all crop lines, and the good news is that the redmeat industry--both beef and hogs--together with the governmentsubsidies are returning some cash income to our agriculturalproducers.On the energy side, there has been a bit of an uptick in therig count from 215 to 223; that's cited as a great improvement in ourDistrict. But having met last week with a very small group ofOklahoma businessmen, I can tell you that pessimism pervades that partof the country, both because of energy and agriculture. And thesituation regarding bank failures is very, very gloomy; they can seeno light at the end of the tunnel, if you will, so they are justhunkering down and hoping that something magic happens that will bringthem out of this depressed state. I don't see what that will beeither, I might tell you. In the aircraft industry, there is afurther decline--that is, layoffs, simply because they cannot competeon an international basis given the value of the dollar and there isno [new] domestic demand for purchases of aircraft, largely because ofthe very big pool of used aircraft. As companies have cut back overthe years, one of the first things that went was their airplane. As aresult, new aircraft just are not coming off the line or selling, sothe industry is simply laying off the people. All in all, it seems tome that we have quite a long ways to go in the Tenth District to jointhe rest of the country in the recovery. But it seems to me that theGreenbook forecast is quite reasonable for the nation as a whole", "MS. SEGER. Perhaps the story that Si Keehn mentioned aboutthe plant closings in the Midwest and the hit that certain states,including my own, are going to take made me feel a little lessoptimistic about both the current state of the national economy andalso the outlook for next year. I think that some of the apparentstrength at the moment is related to tax reform and is primarilydriven by businesses and some individuals trying to push theirtransactions into 1986 rather than do them in early 1987. Anotherportion arises from inventory building and, unfortunately, I thinkpart of that is involuntary. In fact, using our own staff estimates Ibelieve that $25 billion out of the $40 billion or so increase in realGNP in the fourth quarter comes from the inventory swing. So I'm just-46-12/15-16/86wondering if maybe the first half of 1987 could be quite a bit weakerthan we presently expect it to be.If you'll allow me, I'd like to give you some comments I gotfrom a top automotive analyst yesterday about what's going on there.I found them very interesting. He thinks that somewhere between100,000 and 200,000 new car sales are being pushed into this year fromnext year for tax reasons, namely to get the sales tax deduction.Some other unknown quantity of sales was generated this year by thetremendous interest rate incentives that we all know about. Those tooare likely borrowed from 1987 but the exact amount of the borrowing isnot known. The bottom line of his analysis is that total new carsales in 1987 will be about 75,000 below what they're running in 1986and that import sales will be flat. So the whole hit will come on thedomestic side. Also he made a big point--and he does not work forGeneral Motors by the way--about the inventory situation at GeneralMotors. At the end of November GM dealers were already up to 85 days'supply of unsold new cars. More importantly, if you look at some ofthe individual models, their stocks are running above 100 days'supply. Earlier this year when GM had problems with excessiveinventories their response was to launch another incentive program andtry to \"buy\" sales, shall we say. But that was a very expensive wayto go in order to maintain production stability and their marketshare. So the betting now is that when GM has this excessiveinventory situation they are going to pare their production schedules.I don't sense that we have enough of that paring in our numbers,particularly what will likely hit early next year. Also, I'm not surethat we are taking enough out on the commercial building side. I justhave a gut reaction that office construction could be a lot weakerthan we are presently estimating. Salomon Brothers had an interestingpresentation showing that over the past 12 months the new officeconstruction put in place has been off about 14 percent and that theboom that has been running from 1979 to 1986 has raised the vacancyrate from 3.6 percent up to 24 percent in the suburbs and almost 17percent in downtown markets. Using their estimates and running withcurrent demand levels, they think we'd have to get a 50 percentdecline in new construction in order to bring back single-digitvacancy rates by the early 1990s. I found that rather startling.Finally, I really believe that the tax reform is going to take anotherbite out of business spending and that it possibly will be weaker--notjust in the first half of the year but in the whole year--than we'represently expecting. So, I just think that sometime we ought to askourselves if maybe we are running the risk of a recession sometime inearly 1987. I'm not arguing that we are, but I think maybe we oughtto consider that possibility", "MR. JOHNSON. I'm generally in agreement with the staffforecast, too. I think there are some risks, as indicated by thesensitivity of things to the exchange rate. That was illustratedyesterday by the notion about what's riding on the further 10 percentdecline, to some extent. But even if you cut back [growth by] 6/10thsit's not the end of the world. After 4 years of expansion, I thinkit's very unusual and very comforting to know that cost/pricepressures are as moderate as they are at this stage. I don't think wehave ever, at least in the postwar period, entered a recession withthe moderate kind of cost/price pressures [we are seeing] at thisstage. So, I'm reasonably optimistic that the expansion willcontinue. I think it's a question of by how much. I think there isthis continuing dichotomy in the [financial] system and in the economythat's still a bit troublesome. But over time, the change in thedollar is going to improve that. There's a long adjustment periodstill ahead to work out all of the inflation excesses of the past.But I'm fairly optimistic that expansion will continue. I'm a littleconcerned that the expansion in the first half of the year may showsome transitory problems, and I think we ought to remain flexible forthat; I don't think it's likely to be deadly. So, I agree with thestaff assessment but I think the risks are a bit on the down side", "MR. ANGELL. Yes", "MR. TRUMAN. There has been a lot of discussion about importprices and I share the skepticism, both ways, that has been expressedon that. But to the extent that you get import prices moving morerapidly you would then have a direct impact in terms of statisticalaggregate demand, because real GNP presumably would also accelerate inthe process of import substitution that Governor Heller spoke of. Sothere is a direct link there even with the [unintelligible] ofinventory", "MS. SEGER. I will go with \"B,\" but I would like asymmetriclanguage allowing for some lesser reserve restraint should all heckbreak loose", " That's--MR. HELLER. But it would set the stage a bit for theFebruary testimony", "\"MR. HELLER. Sure", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. While I think it's certainly true thatnothing will have prevented us from doing it, I think this differenceis not enormous. It may just come down to a question that dependsupon substantive views", " I only remember one person--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One thing that hasn't been mentioned--solet me just mention it for the record--is that in terms of flexibilityof action I think the performance of the dollar makes it easier toease slightly if otherwise we wanted to than if the dollar was notbehaving. Now, I'm not saying that dictates any action; I don't thinkit does. But I think we ought to reflect that properly someplace inthe record, though not with too much emphasis. It could easilychange, obviously, in many ways. But at the moment it is onedifficulty that is removed in making [an easing move] if we wanted todo so, as I say, for other reasons. But I don't want to say this wastoo big a deal. I would have some slight tendency, as I say, towards-58-12/15-16/86easing language if we feel that way", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wouldn't put quite the same weight onthe staff forecast. It might move it in the direction that wascounterproductive over time", " Gee, we've got a whole hour that we can--MR. BLACK. We can make a federal case out of it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think a fair summary of the discussion--I'm not talking about the directive now--would be that there wassomewhat more emphasis on the risks of a shortfall in the early partof the year than the other. Presumably, the directive will getinterpreted in that light anyway, which [unintelligible] arguments.It's no big deal if we put asymmetry in here so long as that's in thebackground discussion. So I don't think this is a terribly greatissue: but we're pretty closely divided as to what to do", "MR. ANGELL. I would much prefer to say \"slightly greaterreserve restraint", "\"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Could we just try it again. \"Slightlygreater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Can I have a show of hands as to howacceptable \"slightly greater or somewhat lesser would\" is. There is12/15-16/86reluctance in some of those hands, but I see quite a few. You need anexpert to read that asymmetry"]}
