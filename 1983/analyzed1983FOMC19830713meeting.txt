Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 2.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me say now to the assembled group,with a certain amount of sadness, that we just had a little discussionabout a problem that has become all too recurrent: either leaks orgossip to the press about our meetings. I think we're going to haveto establish some firmer guidelines, which we will discuss at the nextmeeting. But for the time being I'm afraid that I want to return,reluctantly, to the practice that we adopted a few meetings ago of, ineffect, having executive sessions or quasi-executive sessions for thepolicy discussion. So, during the meeting itself, at the appropriatetime we will have a smaller group.Let me just say one thing further about this while the wholegroup is here. I find this most distasteful and destructive to themission of the Federal Reserve. I don't think we can operateeffectively if we get conflicting, inaccurate, or on some occasionseven accurate stories in the press that are not appropriately timedand don't have the appropriate imprimatur of officially designatedCommittee statements. Through the years I think there has been a gooddeal of appreciation of this within the Federal Reserve System. Insome sense we are probably under quite a lot more pressure currentlyin terms of the interest in our behavior and decisions, both in marketterms and I suppose in political terms. In my opinion, it puts a verylarge burden on all of us, if we're going to operate effectively, topreserve the confidentiality of what we do and make our statements inthe appropriate setting. It is obviously a consideration that widerparticipation rather than limited participation is desirable. Iunderstand that. But I have to balance these considerations. Thewider participation is fully appropriate when I have a reasonabledegree of confidence that the confidentiality will be preserved.Obviously, this has nothing to do with particular individuals. I madethe point earlier that a lot of this may come from people who aren'teven in this room but who have some sense subsequently, accurately orinaccurately, of what went on and may not feel the same degree ofrestraint. So, it is a problem of the whole organization in thatsense. But if we can't be at these meetings with a feeling ofsecurity and respect, I think it's damaging and ultimately damaging tothe policy-making process. Now I will ask for approval of theminutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any specific disagreement or contention. Instead, it discusses a recurring problem of leaks or gossip to the press, and the speaker expresses their concern about the negative impact it has on the Federal Reserve's mission and effective operation. There is a need to establish firmer guidelines and possibly have smaller group sessions to ensure confidentiality.


Passage number 3.
MR. MARTIN. Moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 4.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it is just stating the word "Second."


Passage number 5.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll turn to the staff report on theeconomic situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that they will be turning to a staff report on the economic situation.


Passage number 6.
MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage provided does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply includes a statement by Mr. Kichline, but there is no indication of any opposing viewpoint or controversy.


Passage number 7.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you have budgetary projections beyond1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking if there are budgetary projections beyond 1984.


Passage number 8.
7/12-13/83MR. KICHLINE. No, we have not done that. We did some ofthose exercises in February, but we have not done anything later thanthat. As you remember, those exercises did provide for a decline inthe actual budget deficit as the economy recovered but a rise in thestructural deficit to levels well over $100 billion. We have notupdated those figures; I presume they would roughly be the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they have not done any exercises or updated any figures since February.


Passage number 9.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Our figures show a projected fiscaldeficit in 1984 of $225 billion, significantly higher than yours. Andthen there are some moderate increases in the few years thereafter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states the figures projected for the fiscal deficit in 1984, which are higher than the figures of the other party. The mention of "moderate increases" in the subsequent years does not imply disagreement or contention.


Passage number 10.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Assuming continued growth in the two yearsthere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention in the given passage. The statement is simply assuming continued growth for the next two years without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or opinions.


Passage number 11.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Assuming 4 percent growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states an assumption without any conflicting opinions or ideas.


Passage number 12.
MS. TEETERS. Jim, when does the indexing start.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 13.
MR. KICHLINE. 1985.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a factual statement.


Passage number 14.
MS. TEETERS. And how much does that take out of revenue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement by MS. TEETERS is a factual question asking for the amount that is taken out of revenue.


Passage number 15.
MR. KICHLINE. There are lots of things I remember, but thatI don't remember. I'm sorry. It obviously hinges on one's inflationprojection. If we were to run with very mild inflation projections--that is, in the 4 to 5 percent range--it would not be large early on.As you recognize, that cumulates over time in terms of substantiallosses. But I would presume that with small rates of inflation, as wecould conceivably have for 1985, it would not be huge. This is thelast year. That is, the July tax cut [unintelligible] but the fulleffect of it will be felt in the 1984 fiscal year. I'm sorry, but Idon't have a dollar estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing their perspective on the potential impact of inflation on losses.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 16.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'd like to ask a question. I'm surethis has something to do with statistical intricacies. On thecontribution of selected components to real GNP, as I understand it,even though there is a deteriorating export performance you show apositive contribution of net exports in 1984 as contrasted to 1983.Could you explain that to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes
Explanation: The speaker acknowledges that there might be some statistical intricacies involved and questions the apparent contradiction between a deteriorating export performance and a positive contribution of net exports in 1984 compared to 1983. This suggests a potential disagreement or contention in the interpretation of the data.


Passage number 17.
MR. WALLICH. That's when it stops getting worse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only presents a statement without any conflicting ideas or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 18.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no clear contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 19.
 No, it does get some--MR. ZEISEL. It goes slightly positive, President Solomon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that something does occur but notes that it has only a slight positive effect.


Passage number 20.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But why.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a question. There is no contention or disagreement evident.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 21.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What he's saying is that the currentaccount estimate shows it worse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "shows it worse" suggests that there is a disagreement or discrepancy between the current account estimate and someone else's assessment or expectation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 22.
MR. TRUMAN. Yes, because that's the effect of the pricechange. We have a [terms of] trade loss, so the import prices risemuch more rapidly than the export prices. That's why imports arelarger to begin with. So in real terms the net export positionimproves in 1984, as shown in Jerry's figures, but in nominal terms itgets worse because of the terms of trade loss. The latter adds to our7/12-13/83nominal current account dollar deficit; it doesn't add to our netexports.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Truman states that the net export position improves in real terms in 1984, but gets worse in nominal terms due to the terms of trade loss.


Passage number 23.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Did you say this assumes a 15 percentor a 10 percent depreciation of the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 24.
MR. TRUMAN. It's 15 percent by the end of 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 25.
MR. BOEHNE. In the state and local area, that chart thatshows surpluses of the state and local governments struck me as beingat odds with what one normally perceives [the situation] to be. In myarea of New Jersey and Pennsylvania it's quite the contrary; the stateand local deficits are quite large. I just have an impression fromthe national press that there are problems nationwide yet the chartshows a surplus and the surplus is getting bigger. I'm sure you haveto be right, but I wonder if you could [explain it].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. Mr. Boehne expresses his disagreement or contention with the chart that shows surpluses of state and local governments. He states that his perception of the situation in his area is different, with large deficits instead. He questions the accuracy of the chart and seeks an explanation.


Passage number 26.
MR. MORRIS. It's pension plans, which are carried in astate's budget as an expense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presented as a fact about how pension plans are carried in a state's budget.


Passage number 27.
MR. PRELL. These are the operating budgets, taking out thoseretirement plans. I think what has happened in many locales--New YorkCity, for example--is that the financial situation has improved muchmore rapidly than had been expected. Of course, there have beensizable tax increases; in the aggregate I think they're on the orderof $5 to $6 billion. And the cumulative effect of all this has been asignificant swing into what is a relatively sizable operating surplus,according to the data we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is simply providing factual information about the financial situation in New York City.


Passage number 28.
MR. KICHLINE. All of the quarters in 1982 on that basis weredeficit quarters, but the current figures show they were in surplus inthe first quarter [of 1983] and the second quarter as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the information that in 1982 all quarters were deficit quarters, but in 1983, the first and second quarters were in surplus.


Passage number 29.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. These are national income accountingfigures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that "These are national income accounting figures" without any indication of disagreement or contention. It is a neutral statement of fact.


Passage number 30.
MR. KICHLINE. Correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply affirming that "Correct" is the correct answer or statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 31.
MR. MARTIN. Jim, I wonder if you could enlighten me a littlewith regard to the interest rate assumptions consistent with the[Greenbook GNP projection] as shown in Appendix I in the Bluebook. Itseems to me that the projected increase in interest rates,particularly for the Aaa utilities and the fixed rate mortgages, israther modest. It's an increase of 5/8 point or 60 basis points orsomething of that sort. That seems to me to be a relatively lowthreshold for these rates to achieve. Can you help me understand whyyou have such low ceilings as your--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses their disagreement with the projected increase in interest rates, stating that it is relatively low and questioning the reasoning behind it.


Passage number 32.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, as you can appreciate, things have beenhappening since we put this forecast together. When I looked at thischart on interest rates, as a matter of fact, I had in mind thatinterest rates would be moving up about a percentage point. But as ofyesterday it was about forty-five basis points for the bill ratebecause that rate already had taken a 50 basis point increase alongthe way. So, part of the answer is that just in the last few weeksmarket rates, indeed, have been moving up. The numbers that we havein the forecast are the ones shown in Appendix I. Some of those ratesin long markets and the mortgage market in particular clearly have7/12-13/83been moving up. They are almost to the levels we had envisaged as anaverage rate for the third quarter. So, implicitly, what we arethinking is that the rate moves that would be encompassed in thisforecast would allow room for some further rise in rates but not agreat deal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining that interest rates have been moving up, but the forecast in the passage allows for some further rise in rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 33.
MR. MARTIN. So, indeed, if the structure has a higherthreshold than you've shown, wouldn't that cast some doubt over thehousing forecast and particularly the less creditworthy bank borrowerswho resort to the commercial bank window as you've indicated they willbe pushing to do in 1984. And that perhaps would affect the volume ofconsumer borrowing. It's all on the negative side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in this passage. Mr. Martin is questioning the accuracy and reliability of the housing forecast and the potential impact on consumer borrowing. He is raising doubts and suggesting a negative outcome.


Passage number 34.
MR. KICHLINE. I must say, though, that if you look back overthe performance of the last six months, we clearly have raised our[forecast of] real GNP and we have raised our view on the Ms as wellas the interest rates that go with the forecast. We did not have aclear interpretation of what rate levels or changes in rates would beconsistent with activity in the first half. It turned out that theywere consistent with much stronger activity. So, we believe that thatwill be at work in the future. But one of the arguments for amoderation in growth of economic activity late this year, andespecially in 1984, comes from the financial side. The explanation isthat those rates, in our view, should be high enough to damp activitya bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 35.
MR. ROBERTS. You mentioned a revision in manufacturingcapacity. Could you comment on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple request for information.


Passage number 36.
MR. KICHLINE. I think Jerry mentioned it, so we'll let himcomment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not show any disagreement or contention. Mr. Kichline simply acknowledges that Jerry mentioned something and is giving him an opportunity to comment on it.


Passage number 37.
MR. ZEISEL. Thank you. This is part of a series of suchadjustments that have occurred over the years, periodically. We willbe bringing the new numbers out later this month. They involve anadjustment in capital and capacity utilization figures, utilizing allsorts of data that we can put our hands on: industry data, surveydata from McGraw-Hill, data from our own Census Bureau survey, and soon. It involves a revision of capital stock, which raises thecapacity utilization rate by 1-2/3 percentage points at the currenttime. There are substantially larger increases in some industries,particularly some hard goods industries, but on balance it reallydoesn't change the situation dramatically. I might say that we've hadto be rather conservative in the way we approach these adjustments,particularly in the middle of a contraction phase of the cycle,because what firms say they are putting out of production today theymay change their minds on six months down the line if productionincreases considerably. So, we tend to be rather cautious about it.But, generally, that is the nature of the adjustment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreeable statements. It mainly provides information about adjustments in capital and capacity utilization figures and explains the cautious approach taken in making these adjustments.


Passage number 38.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. How much are you reducing thecapacity of the steel industry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple question that does not involve any disagreement or contention. It is asking for information about reducing the capacity of the steel industry.


Passage number 39.
MR. ZEISEL. I think the capacity utilization rate changes 5percentage points. But, of course, it remains relatively low, so that[the reduction] doesn't have any particular significance for pressureson that industry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their belief that the capacity utilization rate changes by 5 percentage points but clarifies that it does not have significant implications for the industry.


Passage number 40.
7/12-13/83 -5-MR. BALLES. Jim, I'd like to ask a question, if I may, onthe federal government share of total credit flows, which was[depicted in] the lower half of the first chart that Mike Prellreferred to. I believe that has quite a bearing on the outlook forinterest rates, real and nominal. My question specifically, Mike, is:Do you have anything in here other than the unified budget deficit.That is, have you included off-budget deficits and mortgage pools andguaranteed loans. Just what is in this measurement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Balles, is asking a question to clarify the information presented by Mike Prell.


Passage number 41.
MR. PRELL. This measurement is borrowing by the U.S.Treasury, which covers both the unified deficit and the off-budgetdeficit. It does not include government guaranteed or sponsoredagency issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing a factual statement about the measurement of borrowing by the U.S. Treasury. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 42.
MR. BALLES. All right, thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It simply acknowledges and expresses gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 43.
MR. WALLICH. When I look at your chart on GNP prices andunit labor costs, they've been moving closely together since 1977 andthat suggests that there's a basis for your declining inflationprojection. But there are many other forecasters who have aprojection of rising inflation. Do they have different assumptions asto unit labor costs that are necessary in [arriving at] suchforecasts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "other forecasters" who have a projection of rising inflation suggests that there are different assumptions and perspectives on unit labor costs that lead to varying forecasts.


Passage number 44.
MR. ZEISEL. I don't think it's a fundamental [difference in]unit labor costs trends, although there are differences in the viewsof productivity trends. We may be a little more optimistic in ourview of productivity than some, but not a great deal because we remainrather conservative. Our view is that long-term productivity growthat this point is just a little over 1 percent, up about a half pointfrom where it was assumed to be but certainly nothing like the kindsof productivity [trends] that we had earlier. I think it's more afunction of a reading of the implications of the speed of recovery andits effect on wage adjustments and pricing performance. I must saythat our staff, in evaluating past performance and utilizing whateverquantitative tools we have available, tends to come out with ratheroptimistic results about the inflation outlook--somewhat moreoptimistic, in fact, than we have incorporated here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that there may be differences in views on productivity trends, but they remain relatively conservative in their view. Additionally, the speaker mentions that their staff tends to be optimistic about the inflation outlook, but this does not indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 45.
MS. TEETERS. Jerry, you have non-oil import prices here.What assumption do you have on imported oil prices.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MS. TEETERS is asking a question about the assumption made regarding imported oil prices.


Passage number 46.
MR. ZEISEL. I think those are relatively stable in realterms.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker makes a statement about something being relatively stable in real terms without contradicting or challenging any other ideas.


Passage number 47.
MR. TRUMAN. No, they are stable in nominal terms, as Imentioned. Essentially, the assumption underlying the forecast isthat oil prices will be unchanged throughout the projection [period];we have built in a small adjustment for the very slight rise ofsomething like 50 cents a barrel from currently recorded figures, butthat [reflects] a tightening of spot [prices].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Truman explaining the assumptions underlying a forecast.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 48.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Coming back to Governor Wallich'spoint: Most forecasters are projecting a higher rate of inflationthan we are. Certainly, that's the feeling in the financialcommunity; they are looking toward inflation of 5 to 6 percent insteadof around 4 percent. Is it that their assumptions and models aredifferent or is it that they are factoring in, in an intangible way,7/12-13/83psychological expectations, commodity prices, etcetera, and are notbasing it primarily on unit labor costs. How does the CEA come outwith a higher inflation [projection].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker mentions that most forecasters are projecting a higher rate of inflation than the speaker's organization (CEA). The speaker speculates that this difference could be due to different assumptions, models, or factors considered by the forecasters, such as psychological expectations and commodity prices. Therefore, there seems to be disagreement or contention regarding the inflation projection between the speaker's organization and other forecasters.


Passage number 49.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, that one is easy to answer. That tracksright into the budget numbers that one is going to display. Indeveloping the Administration forecast, a number of the participantsargued for lower rates in their belief that there will be a betterinflation [outcome], but that of course drives up the budget deficit.I think the answer is that a number things are important ininfluencing expectations. One is the dollar and one is the notion of[the economy] growing rapidly; there will be speed limit effects andwe will have lessened slack by 1984. It's very difficult to use pastexperience and come up with a substantial acceleration in wage ratesin the future. If you want to argue the case, you could say that alot of the good performance we've had recently represents concessionsand that as soon as profits pick up that's going to disappear. Thatmay be the case. But we've just seen in the second quarter morecompanies added to the list of those still [getting] concessions andthree-year contracts with no wage increases. We have a view that,yes, there are cyclical effects here but that we will have enoughslack, judged in terms of the level of underutilized resources, tokeep putting downward pressure on wage rates. We view that as afundamental.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not expressing contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting different viewpoints and discussing various factors that influence expectations.


Passage number 50.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Have you fed back in Ted Truman's 15percent depreciation of the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 51.
MR. KICHLINE. Yes. He's causing us difficulty, obviously.Without Ted Truman we would have lower rates of inflation. We dobelieve that to be a very important argument for 1985. That is onething I should note: The partial dollar impact that we have ondomestic prices in 1984 would build in 1985 and would have a largereffect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement about the impact of Ted Truman on inflation rates and the belief that lower rates of inflation would be beneficial in 1985.


Passage number 52.
MR. TRUMAN. That's the reason why we had that alternativechart there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not include any statement that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the reason for having an alternative chart without indicating any conflicting viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 53.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We all have been assuming adepreciation of the dollar and factoring it in for the last year, andit hasn't come about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement simply states a fact that people have been assuming a depreciation of the dollar but it hasn't happened. There is no evident contention or disagreement.


Passage number 54.
MR. MORRIS. You're showing in 1984 a drop of 0.8 in theunemployment rate associated with a 4.2 percent real growth rate. Mystaff suggests that that is a rather large drop in the unemploymentrate historically for a 4.2 percent real growth rate. Are youassuming labor force growth is dropping off sharply or what is it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification or further information about the assumptions made regarding the drop in the unemployment rate.


Passage number 55.
MR. ZEISEL. No, labor force growth doesn't drop off sharply;actually, it increases quite a bit. We feel that a 4-1/4 percentincrease in GNP is close to 2 percent above capacity growth and thatthis decline in the unemployment rate of about 3/4 of a point ishistorically reasonable using something like an Okun's lawcalculation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting Mr. Zeisel's view and calculations.


Passage number 56.
MR. MORRIS. Really. As a matter of fact, our staff thinksit's high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The phrase "our staff thinks it's high" is a statement of fact, without any implied disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 57.
7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a very low productivity growth in1984 compared to historical cyclical experience, don't you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The person is suggesting that there was a low productivity growth in 1984 compared to historical cyclical experience, and is asking the other person if they agree or disagree.


Passage number 58.
MR. ZEISEL. Our productivity is low, certainly based onearlier postwar experience, [such as] in the '60s when productivitywas rising [unintelligible] percent or so. It is now in the [1-1/4]percent range. But it is higher than it was running in the 1970s; itis twice as high, and that of course plays a role. That is, in fact,relatively low productivity. But incorporating that productivitytrend into the calculation--if one wants to take this kind ofmechanical, that is, purely the Okun's law approach--I think does giveus a decline of something like that magnitude for a rate of [GNP]increase of 4-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting information about productivity rates and trends.


Passage number 59.
MR. PRELL. In mechanical terms, if we move above thecyclical trend in the early part of recovery, as the recovery matureswe are going to have a period when productivity growth is somewhatbelow the trend rate of growth so as to return to the trend line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the expected pattern of productivity growth in relation to the cyclical trend during the recovery process.


Passage number 60.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Haven't we begun to see that already.In recent months hasn't productivity declined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statements are presented as factual questions, not as opposing or contradictory viewpoints.


Passage number 61.
MR. ZEISEL. No, I don't think so. We still have fairlyvigorous productivity gains. In manufacturing, productivity is risingcertainly 4 percent or [even] above that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 62.
MR. KEEHN. May I go back to capacity utilization. You showa reasonably good increase in capacity utilization in 1983 and 1984.The capital expenditure line looks awfully steep. Do you have apretty good confidence factor on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 63.
MR. ZEISEL. The growth in capital outlays. Well, the onlything we have hard evidence on at the moment is new orders fornondefense capital equipment, which shows a pretty vigorousturnaround. Now, that doesn't tell us much about what is going tohappen in 1984 but it tends to be a reasonably good lead indicator forthe near term.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states the evidence they have regarding the growth in capital outlays and acknowledges that it may not predict future outcomes.


Passage number 64.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where are those new orders in relation tosales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply asking for the location of new orders in relation to sales. It does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 65.
MR. GRAMLEY. Are unfilled orders rising or falling at thispoint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply asks a question without expressing any conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 66.
MR. ZEISEL. I think they have started to fall. Excuse me,they have turned around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Zeisel is simply stating his observation that something has started to fall and then corrects himself by stating that it has actually turned around.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 67.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just by a little. Aren't the new ordersbarely above sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is a disagreement in the passage. The use of "just by a little" and "barely" implies that the new orders are slightly higher than sales, while the word "Aren't" suggests an opposing viewpoint questioning if the new orders are really only slightly higher.


Passage number 68.
MR. KICHLINE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not provide any information about Mr. Kichline or any contentions or disagreements related to him.


Passage number 69.
 Yes, but they were running the other way andthere is a hint that we have reached the bottom and there is a turnwhere new orders--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now, if you want to be pessimistic, youcan say this order increase is necessary to maintain the current levelof sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker presents two contrasting perspectives, one optimistic and one pessimistic, but there is no direct disagreement between them.


Passage number 70.
7/12-13/83MR. ZEISEL. Yes, you can. Our forecasts for capitalspending are based upon relationships with real output and themultiple effects of demand on capital outlays. And in this case theyare pretty much in line with past performance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply explains that the forecasts for capital spending are based on certain factors and are consistent with past performance.


Passage number 71.
MR. KEEHN. Your confidence factor is pretty high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Keen, is expressing that the confidence factor is relatively high.


Passage number 72.
MR. KICHLINE. Yes, given interest rates now. In answer toyour question, there are some things going on behind this that we tryto take into account. One is that we have petroleum drilling, whichgets wrapped up in these numbers, rising but not a lot because wethink that market is going to be rather depressed given the oil pricesituation. We do think that in many areas of the country a majorcollapse is underway in certain commercial and office buildingconstruction, and that is likely to be negative going into 1984 forsome time. In the past what has happened, however, is that equipmentpurchases have been the first to pick up and we have seen a good dealof that. Now, early on, the [sales of] autos collapsed and they were[selling] at a discount. And they get wrapped up in these numbers.But office equipment, computer-related products, have been verystrong. So, that is the sustaining force early on. But [ourforecast] is conservative, I think, in the sense that most of themodels say--and certainly the cyclical experience says--that we'rerunning a little below what has happened in past cycles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and analysis without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 73.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This new orders figure is for plant aswell as equipment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that the new orders figure includes both plant and equipment.


Passage number 74.
MR. ZEISEL. No, the new orders figure is for nondefenseequipment alone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the new orders figure.


Passage number 75.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have one other question, which I willinsert. You have credit growth rising more rapidly than GNP and yousay that is contrary to usual cyclical experience. Why.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not exhibit contention or disagreement. It is a statement by one person posing a question to another person.


Passage number 76.
MR. PRELL. We go through this on a sector-by-sector basis,as well as looking at it in the aggregate. Taking existing balancesheet positions as a start, trying to maintain reasonable levels ofliquidity in the business sector and building up all these flows, thisis what we come up with. Going back and then looking at that againand asking whether we are comfortable with this, I guess we'vesuggested before that we don't have any great theory of creditaggregate behavior. What we're left with is the feeling that giventhe size of the federal deficit and the kind of spending and borrowingrelationships that might come from that, this relatively rapid growthof debt is sensible. I would note that we were expecting a somewhatbigger gap than seems to be materializing this year. But there is,nonetheless, this gap. We don't see the development thus far thisyear of what would be a normal pattern where, on average, creditgrowth is falling short of GNP growth by a couple percentage points inthe first year of recovery. We think it probably has something to dowith this very large government borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their observation and analysis of credit aggregate behavior and the impact of the federal deficit and government borrowing. There are no conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 77.
MR. PARTEE. That could be a result of government borrowingnot being as stimulative as private borrowing. That could be becauseit's mainly receipts reduction. And it could have a flow-througheffect on savings, although the saving rate is awfully low in yourforecast, which was the point I was going to make. It seems to me7/12-13/83that you have a rather low saving rate for the next 6 quarterscompared to historical experience. There is no evidence whatsoever ofsavings being stimulated by tax incentives and so forth, from what Ican see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is expressing disagreement with the forecast presented by the other person. He believes that the saving rate in the forecast is too low and questions the effectiveness of tax incentives in stimulating savings.


Passage number 78.
MR. PRELL. Well, it could be that there is something goingon in the disinflationary process, for example, that makes people wantto hold more financial assets relative to income than had been truepreviously. Essentially, we had a very big accumulation of financialassets relative to income last year. There's an enormous gap, andwe're carrying this through; it's not going away. We have in ourforecast a continuing moderate inflation picture; we have regulatorychanges that make some forms of financial assets more attractive onthe whole.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing a potential explanation for a situation and providing supporting evidence for their argument.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 79.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're taking a position that all thisliquidity isn't going to be reflected in a higher GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is disagreement about whether the increase in liquidity will result in a higher Gross National Product (GNP).


Passage number 80.
MR. PRELL. Implicitly--in the same way that we don't have atremendous reversal of the velocity behavior of the last year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Prell about the behavior of velocity over the last year.


Passage number 81.
MR. BALLES. I'd like to ask Jim another question or twoabout the first page of his charts, the lower panel that dealt withinterest rates. Do you care to share with us, Jim, your explanation,or rationale if you have one, of the underlying cause of this rise ininterest rates shown for midyear up to the fourth quarter and then adecline by the fourth quarter of next year. That's a tough one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no active disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker simply asks Jim for an explanation or rationale regarding the rise and decline in interest rates shown in the charts.


Passage number 82.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, for one, it has something to do withmonetary policy assumptions. That's a place one might start. It alsohas something to do, obviously, with our view that at the present timewe have strong underlying demands for spending and credit and that thecombination of those things, given our monetary policy assumption,will likely result in some upward drift [in rates]. I noted beforethat these charts may give one the feeling that there is more movementhere than is in fact in store, because some of it already hasoccurred. The 1984 projection on interest rates comes out of aconsidered judgment and a great deal of thought and hope on our part.But I'm not so sure I can say more than that. What has influenced us,particularly on long rates, is the feeling that we are most likely tosee a much better inflation performance than markets generallyanticipate and that, as each month goes by and we see low rates ofinflation, double digit long rates indeed will look pretty attractiveso that there is room [for some decline] in 1984. In addition, wethink the higher rate levels that have occurred now will lead to somematuring of the expansion and to some slowing and thus take a littleof the pressure off of the credit markets. But I would not wish tostake all of what we said this morning on the basis of these interestrate forecasts for that year. That's a central area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their views and assumptions about monetary policy and interest rates. They mention some factors that have influenced their thinking, but they do not mention any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 83.
MR. BALLES. I appreciate your sharing those thoughts withus. I gather, based on your remarks, that you share to some extentthe view that long rates are influenced considerably by inflationexpectations. And yet the pattern that we see both in your chart aswell as in Appendix I in the Bluebook shows short rates and long ratesgenerally moving up and down together. If you look back a few years,the [unintelligible] doctrine was that if we could convince marketsthat we were going to pursue anti-inflationary policies on into the7/12-13/83future, we would reduce inflation expectations and have downwardpressure on long rates. The thing I'm agonizing about the most, and Iguess a lot of people around the table are, is: What in the heck hascaused this serious increase in long rates since the middle of May orfor about 2 months now. Have inflation expectations worsened or arewe in a new era where if short rates go up, the arbitrage effects aregoing to cause long rates to go up right along with them irrespectiveof any changes or lack thereof in inflation expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker is questioning the reasoning behind the increase in long rates and expressing uncertainty about whether inflation expectations have worsened or if there are other factors at play.


Passage number 84.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, I could say something, but maybe Steveor Paul would want to comment on their interpretation of the marketsin terms of what has happened in the very short run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply deferring to Steve or Paul to give their interpretation of the markets.


Passage number 85.
MR. AXILROD. President Balles, even some years ago shortrates and long rates tended to move together in differing degrees. Inthe very recent period, actually, long rates have moved up about asmuch as short rates. I myself think it's somewhat surprising, and Ithink that [reflects] an anticipation or fear of further monetarytightening. I would dare say that if the short rates went down in asustained way, there would be a very sharp drop in long rates. Idon't think at this very moment that this is reflecting a change ininflationary expectations. Now, the level of long rates--being highin real terms--might have something to do with the budget deficit andthe fact that you need higher real rates when the government is thepropelling force than you do when private expenditures are thepropelling force, with the same level of real GNP. At least most ofour big models would give that result. So, private spending wouldn'tbe so high at this level of real rates, independently, without thegovernment stimulus.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 86.
MR. MEEK. I'd just add one market factor, which is that theTreasury in the third quarter, for example, will be selling about $60billion of coupon issues to replace approximately $23 billion thatmature. We're really getting a lot of supply and the markets arehaving trouble finding a widening circle of buyers for that supply.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker mentions that the markets are having trouble finding a widening circle of buyers for the supply of Treasury coupon issues. This suggests a disagreement or problem with the current market conditions.


Passage number 87.
MR. BALLES. Well, that's right. And it comes back to apoint made in that first chart that Mike Prell showed: that thepercent of total credit flows being taken by the federal government,as projected forward a year to the fourth quarter of 1984, apparentlyisn't going to come down nearly as much as it usually does followingan economic recovery. We have this new structural deficit in therethat's keeping that share up. Is that the way you'd interpret it,Mike. And that, in turn, could have an effect of keeping interestrates up, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking Mike Prell for his interpretation of a chart and discussing the potential impact on interest rates.


Passage number 88.
MR. BOEHNE. Why wouldn't that argue for higher rates in 1984rather than lower rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not involve any disagreement or contention. It is a question asked by someone named Mr. Boehne about a hypothetical scenario regarding interest rates in 1984.


Passage number 89.
MR. PARTEE. Well, the GNP increase is not all that large in1984, if you look at it. They have 4-1/4 percent real and around 8percent nominal. If, in the abstract, somebody said there was goingto be an 8 percent increase in nominal GNP, I don't think you'd betalking about higher rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact and expressing their opinion on the matter.


Passage number 90.
MR. CORRIGAN. I think the market thinks you're talking abouthigher rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It only mentions Mr. Corrigan's belief about the market's perception of higher rates.


Passage number 91.
-10-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think I have on my desk a study from theTreasury saying that government deficits don't have any influence oninterest rates. I haven't read the study yet; I just read thenewspaper reports earlier. I now have the study. Have you seen that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states the author's personal knowledge and actions, without presenting any conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 92.
MR. KICHLINE. Yes, we got it last evening. I've had a lotto read in the last few days. I'm not sure it quite says that. Ithink what it says is that pure theory can't give you an answer--thatone can construct alternative views of the world in which governmentdeficits have no impact on interest rates or inflation. It also saysthat under certain assumptions those are quite reasonable, but it doesnot come to any definitive conclusion and to some extent depends onrather extreme assumptions. One critical one, for example--ahypothesis that has been floating around for some time--says interestrates are invariant no matter what level of deficit you have. Thatproposition is simply that individuals see through this veil ofgovernment debt financing and know that in their lifetime or theirchildren's lifetimes somebody will have to repay it, so they willsimply increase their saving to exactly offset it--deficit saving.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing an explanation and analysis of a particular view or argument.


Passage number 93.
MR. WALLICH. That's why the saving rate goes down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wallich is stating a fact about why the saving rate goes down without providing any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 94.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is not an econometric study.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that the study is not an econometric study.


Passage number 95.
MR. KICHLINE. No, it's not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 96.
MS. TEETERS. Well, one of the problems is that our hugedeficits have always occurred in recessions. If they took periods oftime in which there were large deficits and high utilization, I thinkthey'd find a different result.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. MS. Teeters is simply stating her belief about the relationship between deficits and recessions.


Passage number 97.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 98.
MR. PRELL. As Jim was saying, it's largely an analyticalstudy as opposed to an econometric one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Prell, seems to be agreeing with Jim's statement about the nature of the study being discussed.


Passage number 99.
MR. WALLICH. If one does a sufficiently poor job of takingout the cycle, one would find that the high deficits are associatedwith low interest rates. If you take out the cycle properly, I don'tbelieve you get that result.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a belief about the relationship between high deficits and low interest rates based on the proper removal of the cycle.


Passage number 100.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a chart on deficits which showsthe current cycle against the median of previous postwar cycles. Whatwould it look like in 1975 and the subsequent expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply describes a hypothetical scenario of looking at a chart on deficits and discussing what it would look like in 1975 and subsequent expansion. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 101.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, I don't believe I have the individualcycle data with me. No, I don't. But as I remember, the rebate cameearly in the spring of 1975, so we would have had an actual budgetdeficit decline at that time but then economic activity continued torise. As I remember, the 1975 cycle does indeed approximate thisupper line; it's below the black line for the median of previouscycles, but the first quarter into the cycle there is this plunge whenwe had the $50 rebate or whatever, and then it goes back on track--that is, it's going toward a surplus.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply recalling the timing and impact of a rebate that resulted in a decline in budget deficit, followed by an increase in economic activity.


Passage number 102.
MR. CORRIGAN. The earlier period is shown in this otherchart, isn't it, Jim.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 103.
-11-7/12-13/83MR. PRELL. That shows a proportion of credit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is just stating a mathematical calculation, there is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 104.
MR. KICHLINE. It's going down; you're correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kichline agrees with the statement being made.


Passage number 105.
MR. BOEHNE. My question has already been answered.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Boehne, states that his question has already been answered, indicating that there is no dispute or disagreement.


Passage number 106.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have had all the specificquestions and we have all the projections, so presumably we have astatistical analysis of what everybody thinks. Those should be lookedat again for any changes you want to make subsequent to our decisions.You have to send in any revisions you want to make in a hurry so wecan prepare the [Humphrey-Hawkins report]. I just glanced at these,and there may be some obvious explanation, but I think the Boardmembers are in a relatively narrow range of 5 to 6 percent, fourthquarter-to-fourth quarter, but with half the year over they are 3 to 5percent on the annual average. It doesn't seem mathematicallyconsistent to me somehow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their observation and questioning the mathematical consistency of the projections.


Passage number 107.
MR. PARTEE. I didn't provide an annual average because Ididn't have the resources to figure it out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 108.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Did they put you in as zero. Is that whatbrought the average down. Something there looks [wrong]; people maywant to examine the consistency. Maybe I'm wrong and there is someobvious statistical explanation, but with half the year gone and asimilar range for fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, I don't know howit comes up so differently on the annual average.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker questions whether they were included as zero in the calculation of the average and suggests that there might be inconsistency or errors in the statistical explanation. The statement "Maybe I'm wrong and there is some obvious statistical explanation" indicates a disagreement or doubt about the validity of the explanation provided.


Passage number 109.
MS. TEETERS. A 3-1/4 percent annual average is consistentwith the 5-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement by MS. TEETERS is consistent with the 5-1/2 percent.


Passage number 110.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The problem is the 5 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement indicated in this statement. It simply states a problem without presenting any differing opinions or conflicting perspectives.


Passage number 111.
MR. PARTEE. It depends so much on the quarterly pattern onehas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The excerpt only presents a statement made by Mr. Partee without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 112.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it might be useful, after allthese specific questions, for people to express any views they have--and there must be some that affect one's judgment--as to either adifference of opinion in general or whether the risks lie on the upside or the down side and how that relates to monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is simply suggesting that it would be useful for people to express their views on certain matters related to monetary policy. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 113.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Let me say that I think theprojection of 7.1 percent real GNP for the third quarter is a bit onthe high side, or at least that the risk is that it won't be thatstrong. It seems very high with the bulk of the inventory adjustmentbeing completed in the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion that the projection of 7.1 percent real GNP for the third quarter seems high, or at least there is a risk that it won't be as strong as projected. Their statement is based on the completion of the inventory adjustment in the second quarter.


Passage number 114.
MR. PARTEE. Well, of course, we have the tax cut.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that there is a tax cut.


Passage number 115.
MR. ZEISEL. Obviously, we really don't have a great deal togo on, but we had some data for June employment and related productiondata. They already indicated that we're coming into the third quarterwith a very considerable degree of momentum. We ran through somearithmetic exercises making rather conservative assumptions about thenext couple of months. They provide the basis for, I think, aconservative estimate of the GNP increase or at least an increase innon-agricultural output of this general magnitude.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that the speaker has made conservative assumptions about the next couple of months and believes it will result in a conservative estimate of GNP increase or non-agricultural output.


Passage number 116.
-12-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me ask a longer-range question. Manypeople have expressed the thought, including me upon occasion, thatgiven these interest rates--and you have essentially flat interestrates--it proved fine in the early stages of recovery that you andeverybody else overestimated the restraining effect. We have pent updemand for housing and we have an inventory reversal that comes alongearly in the recovery; but once we get through that, which may beafter the third or fourth quarter, the economy cannot continue toexpand at this rate of speed at those interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing the potential future trajectory of the economy based on current interest rates. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 117.
MR. KICHLINE. I think that's a relevant concern. Inaddressing that, I think we have to ask ourselves the question "Whydid we miss over the last couple of quarters." Is it because weunderestimated the effect of a change in interest rates and that thelevel is still biting. Is it just that we had some pent up demandsand that a change in rates permitted some things to be accomplished,particularly in the housing market and consumer durables, but thelevel is still binding so that the effect of an interest rate declinewears out and we're going to find that the recovery slows rathersharply. That's the way we had thought about it. We tried to put onefoot on each side. We think that probably we underestimated therestraining effect of the level and underestimated as well the effectsof the rate of change. So, for 1984 we have a smaller rate ofincrease in real GNP now than we did previously, but we have a higherlevel of activity because we have allowed 1983 to show through interms of this higher level. I would say that there is a seriousquestion on that rate effect, particularly in interest-sensitivesectors, which is where I might tend to put the downside risks;housing is one of those. On the other hand, there are a lot of thingsone can point to that could be potential offsets. But if you begin tothink in terms of changing attitudes, we now are entering a periodafter four very lean years in consumer spending and lots of otherthings. It seems to me that there is the potential for substantialspending in a variety of sectors, particularly those that are lessinterest-sensitive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 118.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comments or observations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is a neutral invitation for additional input or insights. It does not contain any obvious contention or disagreement.


Passage number 119.
MR. PARTEE. I would say that I think this is a reasonableworking hypothesis. To me, the most important feature of theprojection is the slowing rate of increase that you are speaking ofthat sets in by the fourth quarter. I think that's terribly importantto us from the standpoint of conducting monetary policy because itcould be argued that this is an explosive and self-building recoverythat will accelerate longer than that and create real pressures. Butthis doesn't have it. I would have been inclined to slow the rate ofincrease a little more, just along the lines you have been discussing,Paul. Also, the export market is an awfully important variable here,and there is an important and so far incorrect expectation of asharply declining dollar. That's important to getting that secondhalf of 1984 still to show a good increase, and I'm not at all surethat will occur. So, I would have put that a little lower. But Iagree with the basic premise that what we are seeing right now is asecond-quarter inventory upsurge and a third-quarter carrying throughof the income effects on spending of that and of the tax cut and thatthere will be a slowing in the rate of increase later on. The levelsof the markets that have been mentioned, I would point out, are notnotably high. Housing starts are up nicely but they are a half-13-7/12-13/83million below what they were in previous booms. Car sales are upnicely but we used to talk about 11 million cars a year and this iswell below 11 million cars at its best point. I guess that's anexpression of the high real interest rate, which is offset in theaggregate statistics by the effect of the stimulus of the governmentdeficit. I think it's pretty reasonable.One other comment I might make, just to be complete about it,is that on balance I would be inclined to feel a little lessoptimistic about the price outlook in 1984 than the staff. I thinksomething could break here in agriculture; with all these efforts toraise farm prices, they might actually manage to do it and we mightget more inflation in that area. I also am concerned, if we do get adecline in the dollar, about the effects on domestic pricing that adecline in the dollar would make possible; that is, higher importprices would make it possible, in terms of retaliation efforts, forbusinesses here to restore margins. So, I would come in with a littlehigher price increase than the staff has. But the general profile, Ithink, is really quite reasonable. And I can't detect whether themajor risk is that we might have more expansion or less expansion thanshown here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee agrees with the basic premise of the projection but offers some suggestions and concerns.


Passage number 120.
MR. BOEHNE. I agree with much of what Chuck has said. Itseems to me that the risk of a runaway boom is very small. We mayhave a little more growth or we may have a little less. The prospectsof a runaway boom strike me as being very low, largely because of therestraint of interest rates. I don't think it would take very much ofan increase in rates to cut housing down sharply. We've already seenin some areas an increase of 100 basis points or so in mortgage rates.I'm told that on a typical $60,000 mortgage, 100 basis points is $45or $50 a month on a monthly payment, which is a substantial amount ina tight consumer budget. We've seen how sensitive auto sales are tointerest rates. We're certainly not at boom levels there. I think itwould not take much of an increase in interest rates to cutsubstantially into that whole psychological area of consumerattitudes. The improvement of business attitudes, I think, has beenconditioned to a great extent on the drop in interest rates. Areversal of that to any significant degree over a year's horizon,let's say, would quickly damp that. So, I think it is a reasonableforecast. And I put a very low probability [on the prospect] that wewill have to be concerned here about a runaway boom.

Passage number 122.
MR. MORRIS. I would agree with that proposition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It states that Mr. Morris agrees with a certain proposition.


Passage number 123.
MR. PARTEE. An "accelerating recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There doesn't seem to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. MR. PARTEE is simply making a statement about an "accelerating recovery".

Passage number 125.
 I'm about to fall asleep; I wanted to use alittle more--MR. MORRIS. One newspaper article I saw that I thought wasrather interesting talked about the second quarter as the strongestquarter we've had since the first quarter of 1981--not that I'msuggesting the second quarter is going to be similar. But it seems tome that the risks of aborting the recovery are still pretty high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion and observation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 126.
-14-7/12-13/83MR. WALLICH. I would like to come in on the other side. Asmuch as I believe that monetary policy is effective, with a $200billion deficit and no increase in savings I don't see how we couldhelp but get a very strong economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses disagreement with the idea that monetary policy alone can effectively boost the economy. They believe that with a $200 billion deficit and no increase in savings, it would be difficult to achieve a strong economy.


Passage number 127.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've had a certain amount of monetarygrowth too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 128.
MR. GRAMLEY. I agree with the staff's forecast for thisyear, and I don't think we're looking at a runaway boom. I wouldthink the case for some deceleration of growth in 1984 is a strongone, given the net export picture we're looking at. The question ishow much deceleration. And I think the area where the staff may haveunderestimated the amount of strength is in the business fixedinvestment area where the magnitude of the increase over the fourquarters of next year is 7-3/4 percent. That's rather weak relativeto what we typically see. I know one can make a case for it in termsof the weakness in the nonresidential construction area. But to turnto your question about interest rates, this is why I think you'rereally going to have to look harder. The survey of inflationexpectations that we get from this guy Hoey came in today; we get acopy of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 129.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I haven't seen it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 130.
MR. GRAMLEY. It turns out that in the last quarterinflationary expectations worsened somewhat over every time horizon,and the 5- and 10-year expectations of inflation are in the range of6-1/2 to 7 percent. If you take today's interest rates on corporatebonds and put them on an after-tax basis to compare with that kind ofinflation expectation, you don't have any positive real interest rateat all. The corporate bonds are forecast at [unintelligible] aftertaxes. So, I'm not inclined to the view that the economy is going tostop in its tracks at the present level of interest rates. I thinkthere is a case that could be made that we may have somewhat more of abuildup of business fixed investment plans this year than the staffhas forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, is expressing his own opinion and stating that he does not believe the economy will come to a halt at the current level of interest rates. He also suggests that there may be more business fixed investment plans than what the staff has forecasted.


Passage number 131.
MR. MORRIS. Of course, most corporate bonds are bought bypension funds that don't pay any taxes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presented as a factual observation about the majority of corporate bonds being bought by tax-exempt pension funds.


Passage number 132.
MR. GRAMLEY. I was looking at it from the borrower'sviewpoint in thinking about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contradictory statements or opposing viewpoints. It simply states that the speaker, Mr. Gramley, was considering something from the borrower's perspective.


Passage number 133.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that's a tricky concept. Aborrower's income is taxable too [unintelligible] corporation. We'renot getting into that today. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any signs of contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states that a particular concept is tricky and mentions that they will not be discussing it further. There is no indication of any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 134.
MR. PARTEE. Twelve percent drops to seven, say, with therate of inflation at 6.35 percent or whatever we have for the tenyears.

 You get very little positive--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Matching it against the return from a newinvestment [unintelligible] to do it after taxes. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. It is simply stating that there is very little positive outcome when comparing it to the return from a new investment.


Passage number 136.
MR. CORRIGAN. Well, Mr. Chairman, I look at the situation asa Catch-22. By way of a preparatory remark, I don't have a great dealof problem with the staff's forecast in terms of real economic-15-7/12-13/83activity. I'm also somewhat influenced by what Mr. Prell said earlierabout this tremendous buildup in liquid asset holdings of the public;whether they're in the form of things we count in Ml or "M21," they'reall there. Against that background, a lot has been said about thedeficit. I don't know about this Treasury paper, but it seems to methat we unambiguously have a situation in which the structural deficitis increasing when most of us were hoping a year or two ago that itwould be decreasing. Now, there are a lot of ways to measure it, butone interesting way that I came across, which somebody on my staff[worked out], was to use the CBO estimates all the way out to 1988.And what is interesting about that is that they have the unemploymentrate in 1988 basically the same as it was in 1980, about 7.4 percent,but they have the deficit in 1988 at 5.6 percent of GNP as opposed tothe 2.3 percent in 1980. That's at least one measure of where thingsstand with regard to the deficit.I also am inclined to think that a number of people,including the Chairman, have done such a good job of educating peopleabout at least a potential for crowding out that, Treasury studiesnotwithstanding, the [perceptions] of crowding out and theimplications for interest rates are very, very real. I don't have ananswer for that quandary, but clearly the potential for anything beingdone about the deficit for at least 18 months is slim to none. I hadfelt that we had some breathing room in regard to how much pressurethat deficit was going to put on the financial markets and interestrates over the forecast period, but I am no longer sure of that. Idon't know how you look at it, Mike, but I observe that private creditdemands right now are rising in this cycle as fast as they have inpostwar cycles as a whole. And if that continues for any period oftime when we have the Treasury borrowing where it is, my hope that wehad some room there becomes rather diminished.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of the speaker expressing his thoughts and observations regarding the deficit and its potential impact on the financial markets and interest rates.


Passage number 137.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that fact is true, I'd like to knowabout it by the time I have to appear in public.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a desire to learn about a fact before appearing in public.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 138.
MR. CORRIGAN. We did it on one of those trough-to-cyclepeaks, Mike. We took the average for the postwar recoveries, and Ithink it's true that the lines are pretty close together. Well,that's part of my Catch-22. The other part is that even in thecontext of the staff forecast, which is very much like my own, I amworried about the potential for some adverse developments on the upside with regard to inflation. I also think it's true that taking thepostwar cycles as a group we have a situation in this recovery whereraw industrial prices and foodstuff prices are actually rising fasterthan they did in the postwar recoveries even though crude materialsare rising a bit more slowly. We have rapid money growth. The staffis assuming, among other things, that we can hold compensation coststo 5 percent. Maybe we can, but maybe we can't. We're going to get atremendous burst in profits in this quarter and next quarter and howdurable that more moderate rate of wage increases is going to prove tobe is a big question.More generally, again looking back at history for what ittells us, we find that in the second year of recoveries the spread ofprice increases over unit labor costs tends to be about 2 percent,roughly. Again, the staff forecast and my own forecast essentiallyassume that that spread is close to zero in 1984. What that impliesabout pressures on the part of corporations that raise prices is a-16-7/12-13/83good question. It seems to me that the only real hope in terms ofmitigating some of those pressures is that we may get productivitybehavior that's a good deal stronger than what is implied in thestaff's forecast, recognizing that it has its own tradeoffs withregard to how fast unemployment can come down. Now, my concern aboutthose considerations is fundamentally based in a deeper concern that Ihave, and that is that looking out to 1984 in the context in which thedeficit situation and the financing requirements of the Treasury arewhat they are, it seems to me that there is at least a risk, howeversmall, that if inflation started to move up, it could jump up rathersharply. Instead of getting the nice little modest 1/2 point or 1point acceleration in inflation, we could get something well in excessof that in a context in which we would already have enormous pressureson interest rates and in a situation in which financial deregulationhas made it almost an absolute necessity that banks and otherfinancial intermediaries pass through the full cost of higher interestrates onto the borrowers who, in turn, pass them onto the consumerthrough their products. I don't equate that, to take Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses concerns about potential adverse developments regarding inflation and the potential for higher wage increases. They also express concern about the deficit situation and the risk of inflation jumping up sharply. These concerns are not agreed upon by all parties involved and therefore indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 139.
 Boehne'sphrase, with the potential for a runaway boom--MR. PARTEE. That sounds the opposite of a runaway boom tome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "with the potential for a runaway boom" is not a cause of disagreement or contention. Mr. Party simply states that it sounds opposite to him, suggesting that he sees it differently or has a contrasting perspective.


Passage number 140.
MR. BOEHNE. In more professional language, an acceleratingrecovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a straightforward statement and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 141.
MR. CORRIGAN. Well, in the short run, it's a situation thatto me holds the potential for a heck of a collision out there, to putit mildly. That's why I look at it as a Catch-22, because even in thecontext of the staff's forecast I can see where we could run into somevery, very nasty problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 142.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, we always can run into problemson either side. You said no matter how low the probability. Are yousaying that the probability of a sudden pickup in inflation is low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and is not expressing any disagreement with the other person's statement.


Passage number 143.
MR. CORRIGAN. I'm not saying it's 50-50, but I'm not sayingit's 90-10, either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty or avoidance in making a definitive statement, suggesting that they do not have a strong opinion one way or the other.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 144.
MR. MARTIN. I would echo the comments that have been madewith regard to the staff forecast for the balance of this year. Butin answer to your question, Mr. Chairman, I have some problems withthe projection for '84 in specific areas. As far as housing isconcerned, it seems to me that this sector is as usual very vulnerableto the level of rates [rising] 25 or 50 basis points [as shown in theBluebook] in Appendix I. So far as the housing boom--and that's whatit has been, conceding it started from very low levels--almost half ofit has been a function of the first-time home buyer. And it has beenfueled particularly by the fixed rate, fixed term mortgage, whose usethe various housing financial agencies are now attempting to decreaseas strongly as they can--I take it without much attention to what itmight do to the total economy, but hoping that it will solve someproblems that the thrift institutions have. Given a slightly higherset of interest rate assumptions, we can recall the already redfigures for the thrift industry; that sort of impact, of course, isitself a downside factor.-17-7/12-13/83Moving on from housing, we have not talked extensively aboutthe [interest rate] implications for export markets. Indeed, if theinterest rate projections here are on the low side, that would reflecta considerably higher interest burden on both our trading partners onthe one hand and the developing countries' potentials on the other.The impact of these rates on business borrowing I have alluded tobefore. If you take the Aaa figures here and increase them some, thathas employment implications which, in turn, obviously have otherpotential downside effects. What I'm getting at is that if it is truethat small business firms are the source of much of the increase inemployment, which is to say the decrease in the unemployment rate,then somewhat higher rates than these admittedly increased rates haveboth business investment implications--as far as the smaller firms areconcerned there will be less of that--and employment implications withregard to '84, not '83. In other words, it seems to me that we doface a dilemma here in that the interest-sensitive areas are carryingthe increase in economic activity and, therefore, a substantialincrease in economic recovery does indeed have a very low probability,and we have some downside implications that I think we need to be veryaware of as we examine the alternatives for monetary policy for 1984.If we together choose one of the alternatives that is going to push uprates, I think we need to be fully aware of the implications--thesocial costs, if you will, or at least the costs in an economic sensethat we will pay in terms of housing, small business, exportindustries, and other interest-sensitive areas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, raises concerns and problems with the staff forecast for '84 in specific areas such as housing, export markets, and business borrowing. He disagrees with the projection and raises potential downside effects of increasing interest rates on various sectors of the economy.


Passage number 145.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On this debt figure: You have an enormouscurrent account deficit projected. Is debt in those figures when it'sheld by foreigners.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 146.
MR. TRUMAN. Payment of interest on them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 147.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, these outstanding credit figures thatwe have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, these outstanding credit figures that we have are consistent and accurately represent the debt levels of our customers.


Passage number 148.
MR. PRELL. The credit aggregate excludes foreign borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply states that the credit aggregate excludes foreign borrowing.


Passage number 149.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So you already have a high figure forcredit, excluding that $75 billion or whatever it is of foreignholdings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 150.
MR. MORRIS. That excludes foreign borrowing; it doesn'texclude foreign investment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply states that foreign borrowing is excluded, meaning it is not considered or included in the topic of discussion. Similarly, foreign investment is also mentioned as something that is not excluded. However, there is no conflicting or opposing viewpoint presented in this statement.


Passage number 151.
MR. PRELL. No, it doesn't. Indeed, part of the counterpartin the current account deficit will have to be a substantial flow offunds into the U.S. Treasury.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Prell, is expressing a statement or fact without challenging or contradicting any other argument or position.


Passage number 152.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is that included in those credit figures.That's what I'm asking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification or confirmation about whether a certain item is included in the credit figures mentioned.


Passage number 153.
MR. PRELL.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as the name "MR. PRELL" is not enough information to determine if there is any dispute or disagreement.


Passage number 154.
 Well, it's the supply side, and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The credit figures are built up from thedebtor not from the creditor. It says domestic.

Passage number 157.
MR. PRELL. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Prell is simply confirming that the previous statement or information is correct. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 158.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we have been for some time morebullish than the staff and we still are a tad more bullish for 1983.It seems to me that every time we get a wave of new statistics theysuggest that there is more strength out there than we had previouslyassumed. So, we end up with a slightly larger real GNP for 1983 and abit more inflation, although as the days go by and the [inflation]figures have come in better than I thought, I have less confidence inthat for the short run. We do not have significant differences in1983 but when we move into 1984 we begin to show many more differencesbecause we believe we're going to have to pay the piper somewherealong the way for the large growth in Ml. So, we end up withapproximately the same kind of real growth but a larger implicitdeflator. I don't know really how to answer [the question of] what ismost likely until we deal with this policy problem. We're assumingcertain things in regard to the behavior of the aggregates and we alsoassume more or less a return to normal velocity behavior, which may ormay not occur. Until we know the answer to that, I don't think we'regoing to know the answer to where we will end up. But so far as theimplications for policy that you asked us to address earlier, theimplication I draw from that is that we're going to have to move tosome degree against this burst in Ml that we have had.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their bullish outlook for 1983 and the potential policy implications.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 159.
MS. TEETERS. I came out with almost exactly what the staffdid for the calendar year 1983 but I am lower for 1984 because I thinkthe level of interest rates will bite once [unintelligible]accommodated. Consequently, I think interest rates will have to godown if we're going to keep [the recovery] going. However, I thinkthe most important assumption here on inflation is the constant levelof oil prices. I think it's a reasonable assumption because of theexcess capacity that's available in the world and the conservationthat has occurred over these 4 or 5 years. If oil prices break loosefor whatever reason, then all of our forecasts are going to be wrong.And that has been the major source of much of the inflation in thepast 10 years. So, I can accept the staff's forecast, but I do thinkthere's more of a problem of slower growth in the year 1984 than theyare currently forecasting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. MS. TEETERS disagrees with the staff's forecast for 1984, particularly in regards to interest rates and the assumption of constant oil prices.


Passage number 160.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if that concludes the comments thatpeople want to make, we can turn to Mr. Axilrod and we can havetechnical questions anyway on his proposals and comments. We'll quitat 5 o'clock.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting moving on to the next speaker and ending the comments session.


Passage number 161.
MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the passage since it only contains a statement from Mr. Axilrod.


Passage number 162.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure I understood that next to thelast sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreeable statements. It primarily expresses confusion or uncertainty about the meaning of the next to the last sentence, without explicitly disagreeing with it.


Passage number 163.
MR. AXILROD. Well, there is some question, at least in mymind, that the rate of real growth might not be as high as we haveprojected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It only states that there is some uncertainty or doubt about the projected rate of real growth.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 164.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say that inflation might then behigher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The phrase "You say that inflation might then be higher" implies that the speaker disagrees with or challenges the statement being made by someone else.


Passage number 165.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 166.
 To lower the level of real rates--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Suppose velocity were lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply presents a hypothetical scenario and discusses the implications of lower velocity on the level of real rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 167.
MR. AXILROD. If velocity were lower. Well, I think velocitythen would be higher, if we have higher price increases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Well, I think velocity then would be higher" suggests a different perspective or opposite opinion from the initial statement that velocity would be lower.


Passage number 168.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Suppose we don't have higher prices butlower; that could be some funny kind of outlook if we got lower realgrowth and more inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a hypothetical scenario and discussing the possible outcomes.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 169.
MR. AXILROD. Lower real growth than projected and moreinflation than projected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod states that there will be lower real growth than projected and more inflation than projected, implying that his projection differs from the original one.


Passage number 170.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're assuming you know what nominal GNPis, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 171.
MR. AXILROD. No, I was making an assumption that the realinterest rates in our forecast and the real GNP in our forecast mightbe inconsistent and that to make them consistent I would have to lowerthe real interest rates. I could lower them in one of two ways:either by raising prices, which might be a very reasonable outcome, orby lowering the level of nominal interest rates to make this level ofreal GNP more sustainable if prices are indeed as low as projected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different ways to lower real interest rates in order to make them consistent with real GNP in a forecast.


Passage number 172.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You raise a great many questions aboutvelocity. Let's maybe take the next 5 or 10 minutes for hearing whatanybody has to say about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting that they should allow anyone to share their thoughts and opinions on velocity for the next 5 or 10 minutes.


Passage number 173.
MR. GRAMLEY. I'd like to ask a question. What specificallydo you assume for Ml velocity for the latter half of this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple request for clarification.


Passage number 174.
MR. AXILROD. That was in Mr. Lindsey's [memo]; let me justtrack it down. It's an average of around 2-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement is a factual claim about the average mentioned in Mr. Lindsey's memo. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this passage.


Passage number 175.
MR. GRAMLEY. I got a little shaky when I read his number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that the speaker became nervous or uncertain when they saw a certain number.


Passage number 176.

MR. AXILROD. Oh yes, it's much lower, but it's still a lotstronger than in the first half of this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that the current strength is lower than before, but still stronger than the first half of the year.


Passage number 178.
MR. GRAMLEY. I thought I saw a number that said 5.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their thought about seeing a number that said 5.


Passage number 179.
MR. AXILROD. You did; for the fourth quarter you saw a 5.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a statement of fact, specifically stating that someone saw a 5 in the fourth quarter. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 180.
MR. GRAMLEY. So, you have a zero in the third quarter and a5 in the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states two scores without any conflicting viewpoints or conflicting statements.


Passage number 181.
MR. AXILROD. Yes. And I would say, if anything, that wouldtend to be high. That assumes a very low growth rate in the fourthquarter and assumes some considerable responsiveness to somewhathigher interest rates, which is built into our forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a perspective or opinion.


Passage number 182.
MR. BLACK. Steve, excuse me, but are you saying that youthink the velocity forecast may be a little higher than you reallybelieve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 183.
-20-7/12-13/83MR. AXILROD. Well, I think the fourth quarter, whichGovernor Gramley was focusing on, may be a little high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing their perspective on the topic without opposing or contradicting anyone else's viewpoint.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 184.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I admire the consistent andpersistent courage of the staff in trying to forecast velocity ofcirculation of Ml. I suppose they have to do it here. The swings areso enormous and so arbitrary and there's so little predictability thatI shudder at the thought that we're really going to come out withmonetary policy conclusions--specifically, targets for M1--based onvelocity of circulation or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The author expresses admiration for the staff's courage in trying to forecast the velocity of circulation of M1. However, the author also expresses skepticism and shudders at the thought of using velocity of circulation as a basis for monetary policy conclusions. This indicates a disagreement or contention with the idea of relying on velocity of circulation for policy decisions.


Passage number 185.
MR. ROBERTS. Are you suggesting that the velocity of M2 ismore stable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is a simple question asking for clarification or confirmation.


Passage number 186.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Oh, definitely. I'm not going backover 20 years. I looked at the 20-year average too, but if you lookat it in terms of the last few years and the current situation, M2 andM3 are running at pretty much zero velocity--exact relationships tonominal GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating different perspectives on the topic.


Passage number 187.
MR. PARTEE. There was a decline of 5 to 6 percent last year,as I recall, in M2 velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is simply recalling a decline of 5 to 6 percent in M2 velocity.


Passage number 188.
MR. AXILROD. President Solomon, we don't really projectnominal GNP by making assumptions about velocity and tying that intomoney. We tend to do it somewhat more judgmentally and then see whatvelocity results we have and see if that makes a certain sense to us.We have a large range of tolerance around the variations of velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their method of projecting nominal GNP.


Passage number 189.
MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I'm having a hard time trying toreconcile what I thought were the central conclusions of the staffstudies made here at the Board plus staff studies at our Banks withwhat I think I am hearing from Steve and some of the skepticism abouthow much reliance we can have on Ml--whether or not we shouldreinstitute it as a target for monetary policy and return to giving itequal weight. I just wonder if I could raise a few questions to[assemble] some facts or at least some judgments, Steve. Am I wrongin thinking that your findings pretty definitely show, now that wehave the history of this period since the introduction of MMDAs andSuper NOWs behind us, that on balance M1 has not been distorted--thatthe ins and outs just about offset each other, contrary to what mostof us thought would happen a year ago. So, if I'm right on this, wecan no longer take the position that one of the reasons we shoulddeemphasize M1 is that it is being influenced by these institutionaldevelopments and new accounts. That's the first question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and raising questions for further discussion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 190.
MR. AXILROD. Well, on balance, we don't think the measuredlevel of Ml has been distorted by the Super NOWs and MMDAs. We thinkthere generally have been offsetting flows in that respect. We thinkthat M1 was distorted by the introduction of regular NOW accounts atthe beginning of 1981 on a nationwide basis; they introduced a savingscharacter to Ml that it didn't have before. And seemingly, so far aswe can judge from the past year's behavior, that has made Ml intechnical jargon more interest elastic. The reason it has made itmore interest elastic is that unlike demand deposits, these accountshave a 5-1/4 or 5-1/2 percent explicit interest rate, so the fall inmarket rates from 20 to 8 percent has reduced the opportunity cost ofholding these to, say, at the low end, 3 percent--[the difference]-21-7/12-13/83between 8 and 5 percent. So, they have moved more sensitively thanthey would have if they had a zero explicit interest rate; one wouldhave had a much bigger loss involved if one had held [demanddeposits].Now, what I don't know is what happens on the reverse side ofthis. If interest rates begin going up, do we get a fast move out ofthese accounts just as we got a fast move into them. If we do, thenwe would have some hope of NOW account growth slowing and money growthslowing. The second thing that has been a problem in Ml is that wesimply have not forecast or made the judgment that demand depositswould grow as strongly as they have. Demand deposits have grown verystrongly and steadily since late last year, except in January andFebruary. I cannot offer the Committee a very strong explanation forthat. In large part, it might be compensating balances; and it alsomight be a foreshadowing of some transactions needs. So, there is alarge element of uncertainty about Ml because it is a new animal.That's why I sound somewhat ambivalent about whether the Committeeshould or shouldn't go back to it as strongly as before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses uncertainty and suggests that there are both positive and negative factors affecting M1 and demand deposits. They mention distorted levels, offsetting flows, interest elasticity, and uncertainty about future growth.


Passage number 191.
MS. TEETERS. Steve, if your interest elasticity theory iscorrect and you have a big exodus from M1 as interest rates rise,doesn't that just transfer the more rapid rate of growth to M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question seeking clarification on a theory.


Passage number 192.
MR. AXILROD. Well, it depends on where it goes. If it goesinto market instruments, no; if it goes into other accounts that arein M2, it's sort of a wash.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting two different scenarios or possibilities depending on where the money goes.


Passage number 193.
 You're just left with M2--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If it goes into other accounts, then theanswer is yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 194.
MR. AXILROD. No, not if it goes into other accounts in M2.It's neutral; it's reducing Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 195.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Neutral. If it goes in the market, itwill reduce M2, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is factual and does not indicate any conflicting perspectives or opinions.


Passage number 196.
MR. AXILROD. [That] reduces M2; if it goes into otheraccounts in M2, it has no effect on M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage presents a statement made by Mr. Axilrod without any indication of contention or disagreement. There is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 197.
MR. MARTIN. But you're not saying that the demand curve hasshifted. You're saying the demand curve probably has a differentconfiguration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin is seeking clarification and confirmation, rather than arguing or disputing the statement about the demand curve having a different configuration.


Passage number 198.
MR. AXILROD. Well, that get's into higher metaphysics insome sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the topic of higher metaphysics without offering any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 199.
MR. MARTIN. We're pretty high in metaphysics already.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. It simply states that "we're pretty high in metaphysics already."


Passage number 200.
MR. AXILROD. I happen to think that the demand curve haschanged its slope and that maybe we're moving down the slope of adifferent demand curve. Whether that's a shift or not, I don't know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and uncertainty about the change in the demand curve, but they are not contradicting or disputing any other statement or viewpoint.


Passage number 201.
MR. MARTIN. It's not a shift.Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement or comment by Mr. Martin without any opposing views or arguments presented.


Passage number 202.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Did you have further questions, Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage without any specific information.


Passage number 203.
-22-7/12-13/83MR. BALLES. Well, I think Preston asked the question I hadin mind. In other words, your conclusion--it is mine and if youdisagree, Steve, I hope you would say so--is that what we have seen isthe surge of money responding to the drop in interest rates, andthat's not a shift in demand for money but a moving along a givendemand function. If that is true, based on the experimental Boardmodels that you unveiled for us at the last FOMC meeting and on workthat we've been doing at our Bank, I end up judgmentally concludingthat the demand for money has not really shifted in any basic senserelative to income and interest rates in the last couple of years. Ifthat's true, then I am forced to conclude that from this point on weneed to put more emphasis on the growth rate of Ml. Now, if that iswrong, tell me why you think it's wrong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their understanding of the situation and inviting others to correct them if they believe they are mistaken.


Passage number 204.
MR. AXILROD. Whether or not one would tend to put moreweight on Ml, I happen to think that it's different from the way itwas before 1981. I think it's probably more interest sensitive thanit was before. I would not conclude from that that I could use thatsame interest sensitivity in making my judgments in the future becauseSuper NOWs have become more important. And I have a vague feeling inmy gut that when interest rates go up, people, once they have theseNOW accounts, are not going to move as rapidly to get out of them asthey did to get in. Now, that's just a gut feeling. But that, too,would affect these interest rate/money relationships.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is giving their personal opinion and stating that their beliefs are based on their own thoughts and feelings, rather than conflicting with anyone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 205.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we're approaching gut feelings, we'regoing to stop soon. We have Mr. Morris and then Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the order in which individuals will be addressed or heard from.


Passage number 206.
MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I think there's something new onthe horizon as far as the aggregates are concerned, and that is the 5percent capital limitation on large banks and the impact that may haveonce we get back to an era where we see strong demand for businessloans occurring again at the large banks. I think we will find anumber of banks running into this limitation and doing what they didin 1969--packaging these loans and moving them out into the market.So, what will happen is that we will get a slower rate of growth ofbank liabilities and a larger rate of growth in market instruments,which might impact both M1 and M2 and have some relevance to theusefulness of M3 as a target. Have you given any thought to this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting a potential scenario and asking if the audience has considered it.


Passage number 207.
MR. AXILROD. No, not in exactly those terms, PresidentMorris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a response to a question and the speaker is giving a straightforward answer.


Passage number 208.
MR. MORRIS. But would you agree that there is a furtherpotential here for a different kind of bank behavior.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a statement followed by a question.


Passage number 209.
MR. AXILROD. Well, you're right that the M2 measure doescover a large variety of financial institutions, including moneymarket funds. If they are packaging those loans and happen to beselling them to instrumentalities other than those covered by M2, wewouldn't particularly get it. My mind is working in other ways. Iwould think that they might be doing that; but if the capital controlswere of real concern, we might at the margin get a little morerationing and a little less interest rate pressures. I know that'snot a popular view, but that is not exactly impossible if the capitalcontrols are very effective.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their opinion and considering various possibilities, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument being made.


Passage number 210.
-23-7/12-13/83MR. MORRIS. Yes, but in 1969, when we had a similarsituation whereby the large banks were constrained by Regulation Q, wesaw a big ballooning in open market borrowing by the corporate sector.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about an event in 1969.


Passage number 211.
MR. PARTEE. But they were constrained week-by-week byRegulation Q. This capital ratio is going to be imposed periodically.The first thing I think I would do if I were a big bank would be to beover until the time of the calculation of the ratio and I could adaptand bring it down. I think it would take a while to catch up withthat. I agree with you as to the direction, but I think it will bemuch less marked than the Regulation Q ceiling was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and agreement with another person about the direction of a capital ratio being imposed periodically.


Passage number 212.
MR. MORRIS. But it could still change the percent of creditraised through the banking system as against the open market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Morris about the potential impact on the credit raised through the banking system compared to the open market.


Passage number 213.
MR. AXILROD. One could have argued in that period, equallyconvincingly, that it was the control of Ml also--it went to almost nogrowth--that got interest rates up. As interest rates went up, whathappened in the financial markets in the distribution of creditbetween banks and others was determined by the Reg. Q ceilings, whichwere an impediment to banks competing. And then that credit gotpushed off into other sectors. Something like that could happen withcapital controls; possibly there could be some degree of rationingthere. But look, what causes the interest rates to rise. That mightbe a question one would have to argue about. It might be that thecontrol of money, somehow defined, causes the interest rates to rise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different arguments or possibilities that could explain the rise in interest rates. They are not taking a stance or debating the validity of these arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 214.
MR. CORRIGAN. I'd just make a brief comment on this Mlissue. A fellow who works for me did basically the same analysis thatMr. Lindsey did, approaching it in a completely different way, andcame to the same conclusion: that he could explain the growth of Mlby interest rates and income and all the rest of it. My problem isthat I don't believe either one of them. Just to approach it aslightly different way--admittedly, this is a very crude measure--wetook the experience of the Ninth District on the Super NOW accountsand extrapolated it nationwide. We said: What would Ml growth looklike if the average dollar value of Super NOW accounts had stayed justwhere the average dollar value of NOW accounts was, at roughly $5,000as opposed to $16,000. When you do that calculation, at least on thiscrude extrapolation that we did, you end up with the implied Ml growthrate, excluding that marginal savings associated with the higher SuperNOW account balances, of 5 or 6 percent over the first half of theyear. That probably understates it too. But I just cannot believethat one can explain what we've observed in Ml by simply assuming thatthe new shifts into Super NOWs and into MMDAs account for all thatmoving around. I just can't accept it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Corrigan, does not believe the analysis presented by Mr. Lindsey and another individual who reached the same conclusion about the growth of Ml. He presents his own analysis, which suggests a different explanation for the growth of Ml. Mr. Corrigan clearly states that he cannot accept the explanation provided by assuming shifts into Super NOWs and MMDAs account for all the observed changes in Ml.


Passage number 215.
MR. AXILROD. Well, we have our estimate of the amount ofmoney that goes into the Super NOW accounts from outside Ml. We putit most recently at about 35 percent. The latest Michigan survey, theone we have through May--and they are very variable month-by-monthgiven that it's a small sample--[puts it at] 40 percent; the earlierones had a lower number. So, we said somewhere around 35 percent. Ifyou take 35 percent of something a little over $30 billion and take 3or 4 percent of something over $300 billion, you tend to getoffsetting numbers. That's how we're stuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply providing information about the estimates and surveys regarding the amount of money going into Super NOW accounts from outside M1. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 216.
-24-7/12-13/83MR. CORRIGAN. I have about as much faith in those numbers asyou do. But even if they offset, it seems to me that you have toconcede that a $15,000 average balance has substantially more of asavings component than a $5,000 balance, much less the balance of anold demand deposit. And that's why I have a great deal of difficultywith Dave's and my staff's analysis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Corrigan, expresses doubt in the numbers and disagrees with the analysis presented by Dave and his staff.


Passage number 217.
MR. AXILROD. Well, you're left thinking that 65 percent ofthe money shifted from regular NOWs and demand deposits and sort ofskimming off the top.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact or their interpretation of the situation without conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 218.
MR. CORRIGAN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The given passage only mentions a person's name, "Mr. Corrigan," without providing any context or information that indicates contention or disagreement. Without any additional information, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 219.
 Yes, but that implies that the underlying--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we will have to continue thisdiscussion at a later date and resume tomorrow at 9 a.m. in executivesession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there does not appear to be contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement towards the end is simply suggesting the need to continue the discussion at a later date in an executive session.


Passage number 220.
[Meeting recessed]-25-7/12-13/83July 13, 1983--Morning SessionCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can proceed as expeditiously aspossible. When I look at these longer-term ranges, the staff has notgiven us much alternative for M2 and M3. If one takes that as thepoint of departure, in the interest of moving reasonably rapidly,first let me ask the question, just for 1983 now--and I will leave Mluntil later where undoubtedly there will be some differences: Whatabout the proposition of just keeping the same target ranges for M2,M3, and total credit. I understand that we're [near] the top of theM3 range now but within it; I don't know whether we're at the top ornot but we're now basically at the top. We're at about the middle ofthe M2 range. The staff analysis says it's all right. Is thatacceptable. Is it that simple.SPEAKER(.). Yes, maybe.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for input and clarification on the suggestion of keeping the same target ranges for M2, M3, and total credit.


Passage number 221.
MR. MARTIN. They're wide ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply states that there are wide ranges, without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments presented.


Passage number 222.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All right. Why don't we just go to 1984,again forgetting about Ml. Here the staff has given us a massivechoice, if we take them literally, of a 1/2 percentage pointdifference in the ranges. I take it the difference here is mainlywhether, in terms of consistency, our long-term posture of pullingthem down by 1/2 percentage point or whatever is worth doing or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting an option and is seeking the opinion of others on whether it is worth implementing.


Passage number 223.
MR. WALLICH. I think we ought to keep pulling them downfirst, because according to the staff nominal GNP growth is slowingand second, just as a general anti-inflationary action.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, is expressing his opinion and suggesting a course of action based on two reasons - slowing nominal GNP growth and general anti-inflationary actions.


Passage number 224.
MS. TEETERS. That's fine, Henry, if we don't respond to themwhen they go over the ceiling because if we do, we're going to have tokeep the interest rates up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward statement with no conflicting views or opposing opinions.


Passage number 225.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not theoretically, if nominal GNP growthis slowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is stating a factual statement.


Passage number 226.
MR. BOEHNE. Just as a point of fact: Doesn't M2 growbetween 9 and 10 percent almost no matter what we do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states a factual point about M2 growth.


Passage number 227.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That has been true for the last few years;it's certainly true as an empirical observation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a fact or observation and does not contain any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 228.
MR. WALLICH. That [reflects] the amount of interest added.If people sit there [earning] 8 percent interest and do nothing,that's how much it grows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of fact or observation about the growth of interest.


Passage number 229.
MR. RICE. I think that makes sense. I think Henry is rightbecause it would be consistent with what I'd like to see over the longrun when we look at what happens out to 1986. We seem to get the bestresults, from the point of view of both real growth and priceperformance, if we slow growth in the first two years--that is, thelatter part of this year and next year--and permit somewhat fastergrowth in the last two years. And reducing the top side of the rangeswould indicate our intention to reduce money growth during this earlypart of the cyclical expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rice agrees with Henry's suggestion and explains why it makes sense.


Passage number 230.
-26-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What is the nominal GNP growth projected--I didn't bring those figures--for 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 231.
MR. KICHLINE. The staff has 8-1/4 percent [fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a percentage figure.


Passage number 232.
MR. MARTIN. But under the unchanged alternative [shown inthe Bluebook] nominal GNP is 8.7 percent for 1984. In other words,we're giving up 1/2 point of nominal growth if we follow theconfiguration of reducing that aggregate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the nominal GNP and its growth rate.


Passage number 233.
MR. KICHLINE. No, we had an M2 that was about in the middleof that range to begin with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement without any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 234.
MS. TEETERS. Which range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is only presenting a question being asked by Ms. Teeters. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 235.
MR. KICHLINE. For M2 we have 8-1/2 percent, or in the 8 to8-1/2 percent area for 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing a specific interest rate range for M2 in 1984.


Passage number 236.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" does not provide any context that suggests contention or disagreement. It is simply a reference to an individual's position or role as chairman.


Passage number 237.
 The 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent--MR. MARTIN. So, we're giving up about 1/2 point of both realgrowth and nominal growth if we adhere to alternative I for 1984,right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing information and stating the potential outcome of adhering to alternative I for 1984.


Passage number 238.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, I think the alternative ranges for M2have [nearly] the same numbers, don't they. It's a matter of whereyou might place it in the range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 239.
 Perhaps I am not--MR. AXILROD. Well, we allege that the long-run ranges foralternative II are consistent with the staff's GNP projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their understanding of the situation.


Passage number 240.
 So, itwould be a dropping of M2 roughly--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Roughly to the midpoint of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a hypothetical scenario.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 241.
MR. AXILROD. The midpoint of that, we allege, is consistentwith the staff's [nominal] GNP projection of 8.3 percent. As Jim waspointing out, the Committee's GNP projection is somewhat stronger thanthis 8.3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The statement suggests that there is a disagreement between the staff's GNP projection and the Committee's GNP projection, as the latter is described as "somewhat stronger" than the former.


Passage number 242.
MR. WALLICH. Isn't the projection going through 1983-84 andthen 1985-86 for the unchanged [alternative] 8.5 percent for M2. Itseems to produce a so much better result that I think it is somewhatimplausible. Doesn't that reflect the low sensitivity of the model,which throws all the weight on a reduction in real income and givesvery little to a reduction in inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that the projection for the unchanged 8.5 percent for M2 seems to produce a better result, but the speaker finds it somewhat implausible.


Passage number 243.
MR. AXILROD. That's right, Governor Wallich. Actually, Ihesitated a lot about whether to present these strategies in thesequantitative terms, which are simply the model's extrapolations from abaseline forecast. I had hoped they would be useful in terms ofgeneral direction but, as we say in the text, there is not much priceeffect from carrying on at 8-1/2 percent [for M2]. And, possibly, themodel also is underestimating the sensitivity of decisionmakers in theeconomy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 244.
-27-7/12-13/83MR. MARTIN. That's an appropriate caveat but, nevertheless,for 1985 you have a real growth differential there of 100 basispoints. Is that not right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Martin is simply confirming a fact presented by someone else.


Passage number 245.
 Our expectation is 100 basis points--MR. AXILROD. Yes, if you are comparing strategies 1 and 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging that a comparison between two strategies would yield an expectation of 100 basis points.


Passage number 246.
MR. MARTIN. The difference in the real growth of [strategies1 and 2] is 100 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement only presents a difference in growth rate between two strategies without mentioning any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 247.
MR. AXILROD. Oh, sure, off the models.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states Mr. Axilrod's agreement.


Passage number 248.
MR. KICHLINE. I'm sorry, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The speaker simply apologizes for misunderstanding or not hearing correctly. There is no disagreement or contention expressed in this passage.


Passage number 249.
MR. MARTIN. That's what we're dealing with. You might notbelieve it, Henry, but that's what we have; that's where we started.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is stating a fact or a situation they are dealing with and clarifying that it is their starting point.


Passage number 250.
MR. AXILROD. Well, these are model results, that's right. Ididn't realize you were comparing those, Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply acknowledges that the results being discussed are model results.


Passage number 251.
MR. MARTIN. I'm just looking at page 11, 1985 real GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that the person is looking at a specific page regarding the real GNP in 1985.


Passage number 252.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 1985.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage because no passage is provided.


Passage number 253.
MR. MARTIN. Yes, the percent increase for 1984 and 1985.Comparing the model's output, which we've been properly warned has adispersion around it that's considerable, under the two alternativesfor 1985 the model produces 4.1 percent real versus 3.1 percent--comparing [strategy] 2 with [strategy] 1. And for 1984 the modelproduces 4.6 percent versus 4.2 percent. Also, as Governor Wallichhas pointed out, the model is showing that there's not as large animpact on the deflator as there is on the real GNP growth. And ifthat's quite right, we must accept the caveat that this is the outputof the model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting the output of a model and acknowledging the potential limitations and variability of the data.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 254.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but wait a minute. If I read thisright--I hate to put all this weight on these things--for 1984 thereare two rows that are consistent with alternative II, right.SPEAKER(.). The ones through 1984, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "but wait a minute" indicates that the speaker has a different perspective or opinion than the previous statement.


Passage number 255.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. At least through 1984 you're talking about8-1/2 percent [growth in] M2, if I understand correctly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact or understanding about the growth in M2 during a specific period.


Passage number 256.
MR. BLACK. That's the one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in the passage provided.


Passage number 257.
MR. AXILROD. In 1984 we're talking about 8 percent for M2and that's consistent with alternative I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact or observation about a specific year and a particular percentage for M2.


Passage number 258.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I thought Mr. Kichline said 8-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating what they thought Mr. Kichline said.


Passage number 259.
MR. KICHLINE. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any arguments or conflicting perspectives. It is a simple statement expressing apology.


Passage number 260.
MR. AXILROD. But the one row also assumes further reductionsthereafter. So, it's a much more restrictive policy going out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the one row assumes further reductions in the future, which makes it a more restrictive policy. There is no contention or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 261.
MR. BALLES. It's down 1/2 percentage point each year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states a fact or observation about something decreasing by 1/2 percentage point each year.


Passage number 262.
-28-7/12-13/83MR. RICE. Steve, in your judgment, would it be correct tosay that you get these results from the model in part because of thephase of the cycle that we're in. In effect, what seems to be theoutcome is that if you start to slow money growth in the expansionphase and speed money growth just before the rate of real growthbegins to slow down, you get the better result.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both parties seem to agree that the results obtained from the model are influenced by the phase of the cycle and the timing of money growth.


Passage number 263.
MR. AXILROD. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 264.
MR. RICE. So, if we are in a period that is just on the edgeof contraction, we'd get better results if we increase the rate ofmoney growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement suggesting that increasing the rate of money growth would lead to better results during a period just on the edge of contraction.


Passage number 265.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions "Mr. Axilrod" without providing any further information that would suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 266.
 Well,--MR. RICE. I'm just accepting the [model] outcome; this isnot my view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they are accepting the outcome without expressing their own opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 267.
MR. AXILROD. Basically, Governor Rice, the problem withusing the model--and what has always given me some pause at least inpresenting the results the model gives to the Committee--is that themodel has embedded in it a long lag in price effects and a short lagin output effects. And it's not at all clear that that is the way theworld works at this very time. That's essentially why every time wepresent [an alternative] that says money growth is going to bestronger, [the economy] will always look better over the near-termhorizon. Output will always react faster than prices. And, ofcourse, the nearer we are to high levels of unemployment, in practiceone would think that's the most sensible thing. So, that is one ofthe problems in presenting these results; it always looks morefavorable in the near term to raise money growth. I would point outstrategies 3 and 4. Strategy 3 slows M2 growth even more than any ofthe alternatives presented and then speeds it up in the latter part ofthe 4-year period. That, according to the model, has a very favorableeffect on prices by 1986 relative to speeding up now and slowinglater.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Axilrod, expresses skepticism about the model's assumptions regarding the timing of price and output effects. He disagrees with the model's suggestion that output reacts faster than prices to changes in money growth. This is evidenced by his statement that "it's not at all clear that that is the way the world works at this very time." He also argues that strategies that slow M2 growth initially and then speed it up later have a more favorable effect on prices compared to strategies that speed up now and slow later, contradicting the model's predictions.


Passage number 268.
MR. RICE. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. The statement "Right" by Mr. Rice suggests agreement or acknowledgment.


Passage number 269.
MR. AXILROD. And output is no worse off by the end of '86than [under strategy 2], which was a somewhat surprising result to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage states a surprising result but does not mention any disagreement or contention between individuals or groups.


Passage number 270.
MR. MORRIS. I'd like to suggest, Mr. Chairman, that themodel has one basic flaw and that is that the character of M2 in 1983and the years to come is radically different than the character in theyears before. And we have no reason to think that we can anticipatehow the relationship of M2 is likely to behave relative to nominalGNP. That is the thrust of Mr. Lindsey's memorandum. We could verywell see a situation in which we push interest rates up and M2responds by rising, depending on whether the banks want to fundthemselves through money market accounts or large CDs. It seems to methat the model simply doesn't have any rational basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is an individual expressing their opinion about a flaw in the model without any contradictory statements or arguments from others.


Passage number 271.
MR. GRAMLEY. I just wonder if we're not taking this settingof the target for next year a bit too seriously here. We're talkingabout 1/2 percentage point on a 3 percentage point range with avariable whose linkage to GNP is rather uncertain. I think mainlywhat we should be concerned with is the cosmetics of this. We're not-29-7/12-13/83setting policy here for the next 3-1/2 years; we're setting the targetfor M2 for next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is expressing the opinion that setting a target for next year's M2 is not a serious matter and the focus should be on the cosmetic aspect rather than long-term policy.


Passage number 272.
MR. MARTIN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only mentions "Mr. Martin" without providing any information or context about him. Therefore, there is no content or disagreement conveyed in the passage.


Passage number 273.
 Well, that is--MR. WALLICH. If that is the case, don't you think we shouldhave a declining target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a conditional statement where Mr. Wallich poses a question and does not express any disagreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 274.
MR. GRAMLEY. I'm inclined to go in that direction, yes. Idon't think the difference between 7 to 10 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2percent is going to be all that constraining in terms of the course ofpolicy. We could change it next February if we wanted to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their inclination and opinion on a matter.


Passage number 275.
MS. TEETERS. We never do, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement or indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that "We never do, though" without any opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 276.
MR. GRAMLEY. Oh, we're changing them right now as a matterof fact. That argument is quite incorrect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a straightforward statement by Mr. Gramley, without any indication of disagreement or contention. He mentions that they are currently changing something and states that a certain argument is incorrect. However, there is no additional context or tone to suggest any level of contention.


Passage number 277.
MR. PARTEE. Nancy is right; we have never increased them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee acknowledges that Nancy is right about something and agrees with her statement.


Passage number 278.
MR. GRAMLEY. We did last year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that "We did last year" without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 279.
MS. TEETERS. Last February was [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to accurately determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without more context.


Passage number 280.
MR. GRAMLEY. We had a target of 6 to 9 percent and this yearwe have 7 to 10 percent. So, I'm reasonably sure that if we have tochange it, we could change it in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 281.
MR. MORRIS. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 282.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My thinking also is that this istactical. No matter what we do on Ml--whether we raise it, rebase it,or suspend it--there's going to be a certain amount of unhappiness.Therefore, it's probably just as well to reduce [the M2 range] 1/2point for next year on account of [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 283.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me raise a question about totalcredit. We have this figure running higher than GNP--I forget by howmuch--at least in the projections for this year; but it's peculiar interms of history. And we have a relatively high total credit targetthis year. It may be appropriate or it may not be, but we maintainthat relationship next year if we only reduce that by 1/2 percentagepoint along with everything else, assuming we do that. Is that reallyappropriate. I guess I'm looking at the staff. Wouldn't you expectcredit to move more in line with GNP over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker questions the appropriateness of maintaining the same relationship between total credit and GNP next year, and asks the staff if they would expect credit to move more in line with GNP over time. This suggests a difference in opinion or uncertainty about the relationship between total credit and GNP.


Passage number 284.
MR. AXILROD. Do you mean should you reduce it even [more].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks for clarification on whether the reduction should be further decreased.


Passage number 285.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Reduce it, say, by 1 point or somethinginstead of 1/2 point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The suggestion is to reduce something by 1 point instead of 1/2 point.


Passage number 286.
MR. AXILROD. Well, in establishing the [M2] range for thisyear, the Committee had raised it a point from what the staff had[suggested] and the aftermath of it is that it looks rather wise tohave raised it since we are running in the middle of the raised range[and above the midpoint of] what the staff originally had.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the Committee raised the M2 range from what the staff had suggested and that it appears to have been a wise decision based on the current situation.


Passage number 287.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Either that or we've got the wrong policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presenting a logical alternative or possibility to consider, rather than expressing disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 288.
-30-7/12-13/83MR. AXILROD. So, I personally would recommend a bit ofcaution and I would recommend lowering it by the same 1/2 point thatyou're going along [with for the other aggregates] at this point. Itis running a bit strong and I have no reason to think it will dropsubstantially. It ought to drop some.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 289.
MR. MORRIS. I would agree with that; I think that 11-1/2percent is too high for 1983.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states Mr. Morris agreeing with a statement, indicating there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 290.
MR. PARTEE. I agree with Paul that it ought to be a point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee is expressing agreement with Paul's viewpoint.


Passage number 291.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you agree with, [Frank].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any opinions or ideas that can generate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 292.
MR. MORRIS. I agree with lowering it for 1984 to 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that Mr. Morris agrees with lowering something to 11 percent for 1984.


Passage number 293.
MR. PARTEE. He wasn't quite sure if you wanted to lower it ahalf or a full point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is unsure about the specific details of what the other person wants.


Passage number 294.
MR. MORRIS. I think a 1/2 point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is evident from the absence of conflicting viewpoints or arguments between two or more parties.


Passage number 295.
MR. PARTEE. I agree with Paul that it ought to be a pointbecause I think we want a smaller growth in nominal GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. Partee and Paul agree that it should be a point and that they want a smaller growth in nominal GNP.


Passage number 296.
MR. MARTIN. I'm delighted to hear you mention nominal GNP orsomething relating to the real world rather than the Ms. It seems tome that the tactical discussion has had to do with how we appear withregard to targeting on the intermediate basis of the Ms. If there isany strategic aspect through the model's output as delineated on page11 [of the Bluebook], it is that our objectives are nominal GNP andthe other general output data rather than the Ms. So, I go back againto the aggregates [relating]--however weakly in the model--to economicactivity, not the Ms. And I suggest that we look again at thoseaggregate figures for nominal GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and suggesting that the focus should be on nominal GNP and other general output data rather than the "Ms" which refers to a specific variable in the model.


Passage number 297.
MR. PARTEE. Well, my point was simply that the staff'sforecast from fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter for nominal GNP is 9.6percent this year and 8.3 percent next year. That seems like a prettyfavorable outcome. In any event, that's a drop of more than a pointin nominal GNP and I think there ought to be a similar reduction inthe credit aggregate itself. So, I think a point [reduction] is theproper amount rather than a half point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Partee expressing his view on the reduction of the credit aggregate.


Passage number 298.
MR. MORRIS. But I think we ought to give some weight to thefact that we have a very optimistic inflation forecast in '84.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 299.
MR. PARTEE. Well, if you thought inflation was going to be[higher], would you want to be easier or tighter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking for a hypothetical scenario and prompting a response.


Passage number 300.
MR. MORRIS. Well, I think one has to make a judgment as towhether a 4-1/2 percent real growth rate would be excessive for '84 orwhether we should allow perhaps for a little less favorable result oninflation than we're forecasting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement expressing an individual's opinion or perspective.


Passage number 301.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I have a little less favorable forecastand it still works out with a point reduction in the credit growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 302.
MR. RICE. If the exercise is cosmetic, basically, I think ahalf point is as good as a point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion on the matter.


Passage number 303.
-31-7/12-13/83MR. PARTEE. Well, a point would change it from cosmetics toreal policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by MR. PARTEE implies that a point would alter the focus from cosmetics to real policy. It does not introduce any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 304.
MS. TEETERS. What do you propose to do with that creditaggregate if it doesn't fall within the range. What action wouldthat trigger.MESSRS. PARTEE and MORRIS. A change in interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Teeters is simply asking a question about what action would be taken if the creditaggregate does not fall within the range, and Messrs. Partee and Morris respond by stating that a change in interest rates would be triggered.


Passage number 305.
MS. TEETERS. I'd put it down to [unintelligible]; suppose itfalls at the bottom annually.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 306.
MR. PARTEE. Lower them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply includes a directive given by Mr. Partee to lower something.


Passage number 307.
MR. RICE. I don't think you would.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Rice expressing his personal opinion.


Passage number 308.
MS. TEETERS. I don't think you people know what therelationship of the credit aggregate is to GNP, quite frankly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and does not engage in any debate or argument.


Passage number 309.
MR. MORRIS. I think we know a lot more about that than we doabout the new M2 to GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses the speaker's belief about their knowledge of a certain topic.


Passage number 310.
MS. TEETERS. That may be, but I think we know an awful lotmore about [the relationship of] interest rates to GNP than we doanything else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges a possibility (that there may be more knowledge about interest rates and GNP than other factors) but states their belief that there is still a lot more knowledge about the relationship between interest rates and GNP.


Passage number 311.
MR. MORRIS. The demand for credit is directly related to thelevel of interest rates. The level of M2 may or may not be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage states a statement of fact rather than expressing any disagreement or contention. It discusses the relationship between the demand for credit and the level of interest rates, without presenting any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 312.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we know a lot about therelationship of interest rates to GNP. We didn't have a very goodforecast six months ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing uncertainty about the relationship between interest rates and GNP, based on a previous inaccurate forecast.


Passage number 313.
MS. TEETERS. I did.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: not agree to the terms of the contract.


Passage number 314.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You would have thought it wouldn't comeout.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing surprise or disbelief, rather than indicating disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 315.
MR. RICE. Well, I don't think we would take any action atall on the basis of the credit aggregate alone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rice simply states his opinion that they would not take any action based solely on the credit aggregate.


Passage number 316.
MS. TEETERS. If we lower these targets at this point intime, we're going to give the impression that we're going to tightennext year. And I'm not sure that that's a good psychological thing todump on this society at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Teeters expresses her concern about lowering the targets and potentially giving the impression of tightening next year, but there is no back-and-forth or opposing viewpoints presented. It is a statement of her personal opinion rather than a direct disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 317.
MR. RICE. Psychologically, I think it's a good thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any statement or opinion that can be seen as contentious or leading to disagreement. It simply states that from a psychological standpoint, the speaker believes something is positive without providing any opposing views or presenting an argument.


Passage number 318.
MR. WALLICH. It's hard for me to believe that a more anti-inflationary posture should have a long-run effect of raising interestrates. It might have an immediate market effect, but the setting ofthese targets isn't really an immediate market factor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Wallich expressing his disbelief that an anti-inflationary posture would have a long-run effect of raising interest rates. He acknowledges that such a posture may have an immediate market effect, but he does not present any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 319.
MR. BLACK. I agree with all this talk about cosmetics, but Icertainly would like to see somebody say something about taking theranges seriously, too, along the way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 320.
-32-7/12-13/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Why don't we use the word tacticalinstead of cosmetic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply performing a mathematical calculation and proposing a word substitution.


Passage number 321.
MR. MARTIN. Why don't we use the word tactical andconcentrate on the strategic aspects of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting a change in focus from tactical to strategic aspects, but there is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 322.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think it's just tactical orcosmetic. It depends upon, at least to some extent, indicating one'sconcern about pulling these [ranges] down over time and whether we'reinterested in moving toward price stability or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It presents an opinion regarding the importance of indicating concern about pulling down ranges and moving towards price stability.


Passage number 323.
MR. BLACK. I'd like to see a large element of that in thetalk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal preference without any disagreement or opposition from others.


Passage number 324.
 But I do think it has a cosmetic or--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We don't discuss that subject much, but Ithink it's going to be coming up. To what extent do we really want toget to price stability in the fullness of time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and speculations about a subject (price stability) that they believe will be discussed in the future. There is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting ideas presented.


Passage number 325.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Coming back to the question ofwhether to lower the credit target 1/2 point or 1 point: If we arelowering the M2 and M3 ranges 1/2 point and we lower the credit targetmore than 1/2 point, it implies a precision and knowledge on our partwhereby we can differentiate between 1/2 point and 1 point. And I'm alittle worried about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is expressing a concern and uncertainty about the precision and knowledge required to differentiate between lowering the credit target by 1/2 point or 1 point.


Passage number 326.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I agree that that is pseudo-precision.But I think what we would say is that the credit target is a littlehigh this year relative to its long-term trend. We did thatdeliberately. And it appears all right in terms of this year but wedon't want it high relative to its long-term trend indefinitely. Thattarget was temporarily high in some sense relative to the othertargets and we're now putting it back more in line with what we thinkthe long-term trend is in relation to the other targets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges agreement with the idea that there is pseudo-precision and provides their own perspective on the credit target being a little high this year relative to its long-term trend.


Passage number 327.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I need more context to provide an accurate answer. Could you please provide the passage?


Passage number 328.
 If you feel comfortable and still[think] it is a time of--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it always looked a bit awkward tome. It may be right or wrong this year, but the long-term growthtrends of credit and nominal GNP are pretty even, if I remembercorrectly. And we have a target that implies more [growth in creditthan in nominal GNP]; it's high relative to the other aggregates nowin terms of long-term trends, to the extent one can make any sense outof this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own thoughts and recalling information. There is no indication of opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions being discussed.


Passage number 329.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. More intermediation and more liquidity isthe answer I got.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement suggests that the solution to a certain problem is to increase intermediation and liquidity, and there is no opposing viewpoint mentioned.


Passage number 334.
-33-7/12-13/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But bank lending has been pretty flatand we're still going to have the big federal borrowing next year.And I think bank lending may be stronger; the equity market may not beas strong next year. So, it may very well be that we will still tendto see [growth in] the credit aggregates slightly above that in GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 335.
MR. MORRIS. But I think the 11 percent [top of the range]will give us plenty of leeway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement by Mr. Morris does not indicate any contention or disagreement. He simply expresses his opinion about the 11 percent range being sufficient.


Passage number 336.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes, 11 percent is all right; even 10-1/2percent would be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that both 11 percent and 10-1/2 percent would be acceptable.


Passage number 337.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we're talking about whether to makeit 11 or 10-1/2 percent at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 338.
MR. AXILROD. Our point estimate, Mr. Chairman, for what it'sworth, is that credit growth fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter in 1984--with our assumption of nominal GNP growth of 8.3 percent--will be9-3/4 percent, which follows our estimate for this year of 10-1/8percent. So you are right: Credit growth is continuing to run about1 to 1-1/2 points above our nominal GNP estimate. If the Committeegoes with its nominal GNP [estimate], it's much more in line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is just presenting their point estimate and acknowledging that it aligns with the previously mentioned estimate.


Passage number 339.
MR. MORRIS. You're right, Paul: It is high relative to theranges for M2 and M3. But that's because we are thinking about themidpoint with respect to debt and we're thinking about the target asthe upper limit with respect to M2 and M3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is agreeing with Paul's statement and providing further explanation.


Passage number 340.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, not on the staff's forecast; itdepends upon what forecast we have. But I think that is true if youtake the Committee's forecast. If you take the staff's forecast, it'sright at the midpoint, roughly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating different perspectives based on different forecasts, but there is no disagreement or argument present.


Passage number 341.
MS. TEETERS. The midpoint of 7 to 10 percent is what theyhave.

Passage number 343.
MR. GRAMLEY. 8 percent in 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given statement, as it is a straightforward statement of a specific percentage (8 percent in 1984) without any conflicting viewpoints or contrasting information.


Passage number 344.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Which is exactly the midpoint [of the6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range of alternative II].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or differing opinions. It is simply asking for clarification or identification of a specific detail within alternative II.


Passage number 345.
MR. MORRIS. Yes, but I think you overlook the fact that inthe second year of an expansion the velocity of M2 normally drops.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the velocity of M2 in the second year of an expansion.


Passage number 346.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me divide it up. On M2 and M3we go down by 1/2 point. At least nobody has talked about going downmore than 1/2 point. The question it seems to me is unchanged or down1/2 point for M2 and M3. Is the consensus down 1/2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the topic of interest rates and stating their understanding of the consensus that the rates will go down by 1/2 point for M2 and M3.


Passage number 347.
MS. TEETERS. I'd prefer to leave [the top] at 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. TEETERS simply expresses her preference to leave something at 10 percent.


Passage number 348.
MR. MARTIN. I would too.

Passage number 353.
MR. BLACK.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 354.
 Nobody says it's the level of--MR. BOEHNE. Well, the only thing to say against that, and Idon't think it's overly persuasive, is that if we narrow the range wesomehow indicate that we have more confidence and more accuracy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges a possible objection but doesn't find it very convincing.


Passage number 355.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's a little peculiar.

Passage number 356.
MR. BOEHNE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The use of the word "Yes" indicates agreement and not disagreement or contention.


Passage number 357.
MR. BLACK. And it moves the midpoint only 1/4 of a point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the midpoint moves by 1/4 of a point. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 358.
MR. PARTEE. Or [it suggests that] we're more worried about arapid expansion so we show our interest by cutting the top end. Incase we get a very rapid expansion, we indicate resistance. I thinkthat's reasonable. I'll go with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the idea of cutting the top end to indicate resistance to rapid expansion.


Passage number 359.
MR. RICE. Except that I'm not worried about a rapidexpansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rice is expressing that he is not worried about a rapid expansion.


Passage number 360.
MR. BLACK. What would you--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply includes someone asking a question.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 361.
MR. MORRIS. Some people are worried about a rapid expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The phrase "Some people are worried" suggests that there is disagreement or contention among different individuals regarding the rapid expansion.


Passage number 362.
MR. RICE. Some people.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: The passage does not mention any conflicting or opposing ideas.


Passage number 363.
MR. PARTEE. Do we want to raise the bottom and leave the topthe same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question about whether the bottom should be raised while leaving the top unchanged.


Passage number 364.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it can be rationalized. I think itwill give us a little trouble; it depends on what you think about theamount of emphasis put on this. I can see comments arising such as"Oh, you are even more intense on these aggregates because you havethe range narrower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and acknowledging that there may be varying perspectives on the issue.


Passage number 365.
"MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, in the last three expansions, inthe second year of expansion the velocity of M2 declined on theaverage about 2.6 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply stating a fact about the decline in the velocity of M2 during the second year of the last three expansions.


Passage number 366.
MR. PARTEE. Well, you were making the point earlier, Frank,that we had a different M2 than we did before. And, therefore, thevelocity of M2 won't do what it did before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee is simply restating a point that Frank made earlier about a different M2 and the potential impact on the velocity of M2.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 367.
MR. MORRIS. But if [the premise] is that we don't know whatthe velocity is today, then we shouldn't have a target for M2. Andthat is my position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Morris disagrees with the idea of setting a target for M2 because he believes that if the velocity is unknown, there should not be a target.


Passage number 368.
MR. BLACK. Frank, that's going to lead you down a primrosepath on Ml, to something you don't want, if you look at what itusually does.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black is simply warning Frank about the potential negative consequences of his actions.


Passage number 369.
MR. WALLICH. I think the main principle here is that weought to bring the targets down and avoid fine-tuning. We don't know-35-7/12-13/83enough about it. [Unintelligible] the lower end and the upper end,just mechanically bringing them down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses an opinion that the targets should be brought down and fine-tuning should be avoided due to lack of knowledge.


Passage number 370.
MS. TEETERS. You can take the opposite point of view. If weleave them alone, it shows we're ignoring them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the option of leaving them alone, which may be seen as ignoring them.


Passage number 371.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I heard two people say they didn't wantthem changed at all. Is it only two people. Well, it seems that it'sonly two people. And I haven't heard anybody say he or she wants thetops below 9-1/2 or 9 percent, respectively. Is that true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express contention or disagreement. It is simply stating information about the number of people who don't want the tops changed and the lack of anyone wanting the tops below certain percentages.


Passage number 372.
MR. MORRIS. My position, Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "My position, Mr. Morris" indicates a contrasting opinion or perspective being presented.


Passage number 373.
 Chairman, is that we shouldn'thave a target for M2, but--MR. BOEHNE. My position is that I don't think it makes a lotof difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their position, but it does not directly contradict or oppose any other viewpoint.


Passage number 374.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we are between Bluebookalternatives II and III at this point. There are pluses and minusesfor both of them. The idea of narrowing a range here doesn'tparticularly appeal to me but I guess it can be rationalized.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express contention or disagreement. It simply presents a matter of personal opinion regarding the options mentioned.


Passage number 375.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It doesn't appeal to me either forthe same pseudo-precision reasoning that seems to be implied.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that something does not appeal to them due to the pseudo-precision reasoning that is implied.


Passage number 376.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we can justify it intellectuallyand say that we don't really conceive of it being below 7 or 6-1/2percent, or whatever, and we're worried on the up side. But it doeshave this feeling of more precision. I don't feel strongly one way orthe other.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and does not indicate any contradictory points or conflicting perspectives.


Passage number 377.
MR. GUFFEY. I'd prefer to go down on both ends; there's somecomfort in using the [wider] ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Guffey simply expresses his preference for going down on both ends because there is some comfort in using the wider ranges.


Passage number 378.
MR. PARTEE. Well, if you don't have any strong preference,Paul, why don't you get a show of hands.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The tone is conversational and there is no indication of any conflict or argument.


Passage number 379.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's have a show of hands. Who wouldprefer alternative II. I'm just talking about M2 and M3--moving themboth down by 1/2 point. Well, I'm not counting; I don't know whetheryou're counting. There seem to be quite a few hands up. How manywant it down 1/2 point on the top and nothing on the bottom. Thatseems to be a clear minority.Now, let me turn to total credit. Nothing here is settledfinally. Just forget about alternative III for the moment. For totalcredit, if we're consistent--well, we don't have to be completelyconsistent between the two, I suppose--the question is whether to godown 1/2 or 1 point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for a show of hands and discussing different options without any conflicting opinions being presented.


Passage number 380.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I would reiterate the point thatin evaluating this it might depend on what GNP forecast the Committeechooses to go with for 1984, because by going down 1 point themidpoint would be below the present Committee forecast for 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining that the evaluation of a certain point depends on the GNP forecast chosen by the Committee for 1984. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 381.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] gives you 9 percent asthe midpoint. I don't know how all these forecasts will come out, butwe're going to publish these forecasts as modified in the next day or-36-7/12-13/83two along, [although there are some] people who wouldn't want tomodify them. They must average about 9-5/8 percent or something likethat for nominal GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is unsure of the accuracy of the forecasts but plans to publish them regardless. There is no mention of opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 382.
MR. AXILROD. No, that's right; I miscalculated or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "No, that's right" indicates agreement. The phrase "I miscalculated or something" suggests a personal error rather than a disagreement with someone else.


Passage number 383.
MR. WALLICH. Well, if we don't lower credit by a full point,we're not lowering it relative to the other aggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich is stating a fact without any contradiction or argument.


Passage number 384.
 I thought wehad--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that's the question. Do we wantto lower credit relative to the other aggregates, given that in somelong-term sense it's high now relative to the other aggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It seems to be posing a question or expressing uncertainty about whether decreasing credit in relation to other aggregates would be beneficial.


Passage number 385.
MR. WALLICH. That is, I think, the logic of the situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. "MR. WALLICH. That is, I think, the logic of the situation" suggests that the speaker is agreeing with the previous statement and providing an explanation or clarification.


Passage number 386.
MS. TEETERS. We haven't had deficits of this size as a long-term trend before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact that deficits of this size have not been a long-term trend before.


Passage number 387.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know whether that's theright interpretation. It may be that these numbers are high becauseof the big deficit and that in a sense we're accommodating some of theconsequences of the deficit. If that's the reason that they're high,then the policy question is whether we want to accommodate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not include contention or disagreement. The speaker presents a potential alternative interpretation and raises a policy question, without explicitly disagreeing with any other viewpoint.


Passage number 388.
MR. PARTEE. I think the analysis is that we get less kickfor the debt than we ordinarily do. That is, the relation betweendebt and GNP is off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their analysis that there is less benefit (kick) from debt compared to usual, indicating a discrepancy between debt and GNP (Gross National Product).


Passage number 389.
MR. RICE. Also, there won't be much growth [unintelligible]next year, if we get it all this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the passage, Mr. Rice is simply stating that there won't be much growth next year, which implies that there is a consensus or agreement on this point.


Passage number 390.
MR. MORRIS. But in any case we wouldn't want to see the rateof growth of debt exceed 11 percent in any scenario I can think of.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Morris is simply stating his opinion about the rate of growth of debt exceeding 11 percent.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 391.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think we have enoughconfidence in what the future trends are going to be--not only thelarge deficit, but also the changing institutional arrangements in themarkets. So, it seems to me that the question we again come back tois: Why do we imply that we have that much [omniscience] todifferentiate an extra half point on credit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses disagreement or doubt about the level of confidence in future trends and questions the assumption of having enough knowledge to differentiate an extra half point on credit.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 392.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think this is too big a deal.What we would say is the opposite--that we implied [omniscience] insaying credit was going to be relatively high this year, which may beright, but it's not going to continue next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage because the speaker states their disagreement with the idea that the issue in question is not a big deal. They also contradict the statement made about credit being relatively high this year, by suggesting it won't continue next year.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 393.
MR. WALLICH. Some people think it doesn't make muchdifference; other people think it does.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage presents two opposing viewpoints, indicating that there is disagreement or contention. Some people believe that something doesn't make much difference, while others believe that it does.


Passage number 394.
 So, I think those who thinkit does should be allowed to set the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well into a recovery--I forget--shouldcredit cyclically be rising faster or slower than GNP typically.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 395.
MR. MORRIS. In the second year in the last three expansionsthe velocity of debt declined by 1.2 percent and then it approachedzero thereafter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It only presents a statement of facts about the decline in the velocity of debt.


Passage number 396.
-37-7/12-13/83MR. GRAMLEY. What happens to interest rates, of course, iscritical. And it will work primarily in the areas like the mortgagemarket, where you can have a substantial degree of variance betweenthe amount of borrowing and the amount of residential construction.But I think your reasoning is sound, Mr. Chairman, that the range fordebt is high relative to the broader monetary aggregates and that onewould expect those things to converge eventually. And, therefore, wecould go a percentage point now without too much damage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the potential impact of interest rates and expressing agreement with the reasoning of the chairman.


Passage number 397.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, who wants to reduce it by a halfpoint, the same [amount] as the others. Who wants to reduce it by onepoint.SPEAKER(.).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is posing a question and presenting two options for reducing something, but it does not indicate any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 398.
 We have nonmembers voting here, so you'reconfusing--MR. MORRIS. I think one point would be acceptable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that there are nonmembers voting, and then expressing their own opinion that one point would be acceptable.


Passage number 399.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's leave that just for the momentand we'll get to Ml. Let me approach M1 by indirection. There's aquestion of what weight to put on Ml and, whether or not it's in thedirective, what we would say about it in the Humphrey-Hawkins report.It may be helpful to approach it in reverse. Look at 1984 first.This proposal of essentially 4 to 8 percent again, which is what wehave now and are widely exceeding, would imply unchanged or a smallincrease in velocity to a sizable increase in velocity but less thantypical.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing different approaches and considerations regarding a certain topic, but there is no argument or disagreement presented.


Passage number 400.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The midpoint implies plus 2 velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "The midpoint implies plus 2 velocity" is a factual statement, without any element of contention or disagreement. It simply asserts that the midpoint suggests a velocity of plus 2.


Passage number 401.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It implies plus 2 or a little more on thestaff forecast. It would imply more on the Committee members'forecasts, which are somewhat higher than the staff forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states that the Committee members' forecasts are slightly higher than the staff forecast. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 402.
MR. BOEHNE. Are these numbers in the context of giving theimportance to Ml that it has been given the last few months orelevating it somewhat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking if the numbers are being presented in a way that emphasizes the importance of Ml.


Passage number 403.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only mentions "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" without providing any further context or information that would indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 404.
 Well, we're going to have to discuss that,but I--MR. PARTEE. The 8 percent on M1 seems to me a little high, Imust say. Didn't we add to that range in order to allow for specialadjustments this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee expresses his opinion that the 8 percent on M1 is too high.


Passage number 405.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't remember.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "I don't remember" as it simply expresses a lack of recollection or knowledge about a specific memory or event.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 406.
MR. PARTEE. I think we did, for Super NOWs and[unintelligible]. Well, we certainly didn't add enough. Now, wecould say the relationship has changed and, therefore, we have anentirely different ball game.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, suggests that they did not add enough, while also acknowledging a change in the relationship that would make it an entirely different situation.


Passage number 407.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, with any of these I think we have tosay the relationship has changed; we're uncertain about the degree.But even with the 8 percent we are implying a little increase invelocity. That wouldn't be unusual during this period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 408.
 But I--MR. PARTEE. No, it's an unusually low increase in velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents an observation or statement without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 409.
-38-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With 8 percent, but not with 4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The given passage is a mathematical expression and does not contain any statements or claims that can be disputed or disagreed upon. It is simply a calculation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 410.
MR. WALLICH. It seems to me that under alternative I we'resaying we're not going to pay attention to it because we can't get itback into the 4 to 8 percent range this year, so we have to monitorit, not target it. If we set it at 7 to 11 percent or something likethat, we do something that has to be changed sharply for the followingyear and brought back to 4 to 8 percent or even lower, and I wouldprefer lower for '84. Now, wouldn't it be possible to rebase insteadand not have these vast changes in targets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wallich is suggesting an alternative approach to setting inflation targets, while the speaker (not specified in the passage) seems to be advocating for maintaining the current approach.


Passage number 411.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's discuss it together. I guess thatis one alternative. We can start out again on Ml and then have thesame target for the next year that we have for this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is suggesting coming up with alternative plans or strategies for the next year, indicating a collaborative and cooperative tone.


Passage number 412.
MS. TEETERS. May I ask you a question, [Steve]. I got theimpression yesterday when you were talking about the developments inMl that you don't really expect the rate of growth to slow down verymuch. Rebasing would get us out of this trap, but it's notnecessarily going to get us back onto a 4 percent rate of increasefrom this period on, given the nature of the Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement and a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 413.
MR. AXILROD. Governor Teeters, we do expect the growth of Mlto slow down. The various models I've looked at all suggest that invarying degrees--some more rapidly than others. But we had beenexpecting it to slow down in May and June, so I felt somewhat cautiousin light of that behavior. But the models--because the interest rateeffect has worn out and there is some slight increase occurring andbecause nominal GNP growth is slowing--all would have slower Ml intoan area reasonably [consistent] with these targets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Axilrod, is discussing his expectation that the growth of Ml (a measure of the money supply) will slow down. He mentions that various models suggest this, but there is no indication of any disagreement or conflict among the models or individuals involved.


Passage number 414.
MS. TEETERS. So, rebasing would be one way of coping withthe 1983 problem as well as the 1984 problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that rebasing could be a solution to both the 1983 and 1984 problems.


Passage number 415.
MR. AXILROD. Technically, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states a technical fact.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 416.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If he's right, it will all work outnicely. If he's not right, then we will have rebased and be over [therebased range]. I think if we rebase it looks as if we're attachingmore importance to it somehow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a scenario where a potential disagreement or contention might arise. The speaker is suggesting that if the person in question is correct, everything will work out well. However, if they are not correct, there will be a rebase and the speaker implies that this conveys a sense of attaching more importance to the situation. This suggests a difference in opinions or perspectives on the significance of the potential rebase.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 417.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My concern is that, as we've seen inthe last couple of months, the markets have once again attachedenormous importance to Ml. All the speculation that the Fed is goingto have to tighten is really coming from the Ml figure because even ifthere's a justification for some modest tightening from the broaderaggregates, it's Ml that has been the discussion point, contrary tothe period right after the initial Humphrey-Hawkins testimony inFebruary. I think putting a numerical target on M1 [is unwise],whether we call it 8 to 12 percent, 7 to 11 percent, or rebase,although I would agree that rebasing may give a shade of nuance ofextra [emphasis] compared to simply moving up to 7 to 11 percent. Ithink there's much to be said, in view of the arbitrariness and theunpredictability of what it's telling us, for suspending the targetfor Ml for the rest of the year and not at this time coming up with an'84 target range for Ml. We would continue to monitor Ml and when itbecomes a little more predictable then come in [with a range] at thatpoint. I don't know how one gets around that problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is contention or disagreement. The author expresses concern about the importance placed on M1 in the markets and suggests that putting a numerical target on it is unwise. They argue for suspending the target for M1 for the rest of the year and waiting until it becomes more predictable before setting a range.


Passage number 418.
-39-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the extreme view of what we coulddo--not have any target for this year or next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage mentions an extreme view of not having any target for this year or next year. It simply presents the idea without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 419.
MR. WALLICH. Well, another alternative would be to widen therange even further. We have widened it from 3 to 4 points; we couldgo from 4 to 5 points. I agree with you when you say that whatever wedo, we are increasing the emphasis if we change it from 4 to 8percent. If we rebase we may be increasing the emphasis beyond whatwe would if we went to 7 to 11 percent. Widening the range I thinkoffsets that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich is discussing different alternatives and potential outcomes, but there is no direct disagreement or conflicting opinions being expressed.


Passage number 420.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think that's true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The speaker simply expresses agreement with a statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 421.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, it's not just what we say [via] thenumbers, it is what we say. We can say it's a target but we aregiving it whatever weight we want to say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "it's not just what we say [via] thenumbers, it is what we say" suggests that there is a difference between what is being expressed through numbers and what is actually being stated or communicated. This implies a disagreement between the two forms of expression. Additionally, the phrase "We can say it's a target but we are giving it whatever weight we want to say" suggests that there is a disagreement or differing opinions about the significance or importance assigned to a particular target or statement.


Passage number 422.
MR. PARTEE. It seems to me that there has been some fear inthe market about the need to come [down] toward the target range.Therefore, people are saying well, even if it were one or two[unintelligible] for the year. So, doing away with the notion thatwe're going to make up the overshoot, if that's our decision, would bea constructive thing for the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 423.
MR. BALLES. I think that's a very good point, if I can breakin and support Chuck's position on that. Moving to the alternative IIrange for M1 shown in the Bluebook for the balance of this year wouldmake a lot of sense, because that range of 7 to 11 percent wouldaccommodate about a 6 percent growth rate or a little better in Mlfrom June to December which, according to our San Francisco model atleast, would provide sustained economic growth and no increase ininflation. We'd come in with over 5 percent real growth, based on ourmodels, for both years. So, I would feel a lot more comfortable, andI would think we might defuse some of the market fears about whatwe're up to, if we were to adopt that. We realize what has gone onthis year so far in Ml and we can't undo that; that would be totallyunrealistic. I think we should defuse some of the market fears aboutwhat we may be doing by forthrightly coming out for a range of 7 to 11percent, which in my view would accommodate the approximately 6percent growth rate in M1 that we happen to think would be aboutoptimal for the balance of this year and through 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for Chuck's position and suggesting a specific range for M1 that they believe would be beneficial for economic growth.


Passage number 424.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just to be sure: That 7 to 11 percentimplies 6 percent from now on to hit 11 percent [Ml growth] for theyear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is stating a fact or clarification.


Passage number 425.
MR. BALLES. Yes, a little better than 6 percent. That'sshown on page 6 in the Bluebook in the final column to the right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a percentage and referring to a specific page in a book for confirmation.


Passage number 426.
MR. GRAMLEY. That's June to December, not second quarter [tofourth quarter].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply clarifying a point and correcting a misinterpretation.


Passage number 427.
MR. BALLES. Eleven percent for the year would allow 6-1/2percent from June to December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 428.
MR. BOEHNE. What about from July, since June--. Oh, June isthe base.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking for information regarding a specific time frame.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 429.
-40-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

In the given passage, there is contention or disagreement because it involves subtracting fractions and a whole number. The subtraction between fractions often requires finding a common denominator and rearranging the fractions to have the same denominator. Therefore, the process of subtracting fractions can be confusing and prone to error, leading to potential disagreements or different interpretations of the calculation.


Passage number 430.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I must say that I think there's somethinga little unfortunate about the numbers 7 to 11. Also, it soundsawfully high. My instinct would be to rebase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is expressing his personal opinion and instinct about the numbers 7 to 11.


Passage number 431.
MS. HORN. I favor rebasing, not only because I think itindicates some additional emphasis on Ml, but also because it seems tome to indicate the Committee's recognition of what we've learned aboutvelocity. It may or may not be the start of a rehabilitation of Ml inthat we say we do look at Ml; we do take it seriously, but we makecorrections for velocity from time to time until we're a little moresure of our velocity forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing a personal opinion and interpretation of the speaker regarding rebasing and its implications on M1 and velocity.


Passage number 432.
MR. GRAMLEY. A range of 4 to 8 percent rebased gives youabout the same as 7 to 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that a range of 4 to 8 percent, when adjusted or rebased, would provide a similar result as a range of 7 to 11 percent.


Passage number 433.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Presumably, it's 8.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents a presumptive value of 8 without any contradictory information or alternative viewpoints.


Passage number 434.
1 percent on a secondquarter-to-fourth quarter basis, which is exactly the--MR. AXILROD. In response to Governor Gramley's comment, itdepends on how you rebase. It doesn't quite [correspond] if you useQ2 to Q4 1983, because of the high growth that has already happened.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. It appears to be a technical discussion about how different time periods are being measured and compared.


Passage number 435.
The rate [of growth] from Q2 to Q4 is 8 percent--MR. GRAMLEY. With an 11 percent--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It simply states different growth rates reported by two different sources.


Passage number 436.
MR. AXILROD. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod simply agrees with the statement.


Passage number 437.
 So, if you rebased and said--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. As I understand this, if we rebase at Q2,the 8 percent would be the same as 11 percent for the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement explaining how the 8 percent would be the same as 11 percent for the year after rebasing at Q2.


Passage number 438.
MR. GRAMLEY. I calculated the fourth-quarter levels using 11percent from the fourth quarter of 1982 and 8 percent from the secondquarter of 1983 and I got within $1 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 439.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's 8.1 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. It is simply stating a numerical value.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 440.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I had in mind figures very similarto what John Balles mentioned, but I think the real issue is how themarket will react best to what we do. My feeling is that it's betterthat we not rebase, although I understand fully the argument for it.Since you said you thought this would imply more emphasis on Ml, whichis what we also had concluded before we came here, that does argue infavor of [rebasing] from my viewpoint. But I believe the market wouldreact a little better if we kept what we have and you just said thatwe doubt that we will hit it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Black expresses his opinion that it is better not to rebase, while also acknowledging the argument in favor of rebasing. This suggests a disagreement or difference in opinion regarding the best course of action.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 441.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me try this: Suppose we rebaseand use 4 to 8 percent and say that we think velocity has changed somebut we don't know how much. The 8 percent would allow for very littleincrease in velocity, which is possible, given what has happened. The4 percent would allow for an almost normal increase in velocity fromhere on out. So, we're encompassing that kind of range. We're stillquite uncertain about it and--this will be the tricky part--we're notputting full weight [on Ml], certainly. Just how much weight we saywe are putting on it is the fuzzy area, I suppose. We could go allthe way to saying that we're monitoring [Ml] but putting very little-41-7/12-13/83weight on it. That's one extreme. Or we could say we have a prettywide range and we would get concerned if [Ml growth] was too faroutside that range in either direction, but we're not following itmechanically.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing different options and uncertainties regarding the weight given to M1 in their analysis. They mention a range of possible approaches, from putting very little weight on M1 to closely monitoring it but not following it mechanically. This suggests that there is uncertainty and possibly differing opinions on how much importance should be given to M1 in their analysis.


Passage number 442.
 Some place in that range of--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Could we have some further discussionof Bob Black's suggestion. I find myself in a strange alliance withhim in favor of saying that clearly M1 growth is going to be way overour target because of velocity and not offering a rebased or raisedtarget for this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges an alliance with Bob Black in favor of a suggestion regarding M1 growth. They express agreement that M1 growth is going to exceed the target due to velocity and suggest the need for further discussion on adjusting the target for the current year.


Passage number 443.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What would you do for the next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a straightforward question asking about potential actions for the upcoming year.


Passage number 444.
MR. MORRIS. Same thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 445.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, my own feeling would be not tooffer [an M1 range for 1984] at this point. But even if the majorityof the Committee preferred to offer a range for next year, thatdoesn't mean we have to come up with a new number for this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing personal feelings and suggesting that there is no need to provide a new number for this year even if the majority disagrees.


Passage number 446.
MR. PARTEE. I have a problem with your suggestion, Tony.It's Bob's suggestion too, but I'll address this comment to youbecause I think Bob might like what I would see as the difficulty.What if we get a very, very low rate of money growth. It couldhappen. And in the context of having the 4 to 8 percent range, peoplewould say, fine, we are getting [Ml growth] back down into the range,and yet it might be indicative of a problem developing in the economyand we might want to try to encourage a little more money growth. Ifwe rebase, we have an opportunity to do that; if we don't rebase,people will think we're happy to see M1 growth come down into the oldrange.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no direct contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is expressing a concern and explaining a potential scenario, but there is no clear disagreement or clash of opinions.


Passage number 447.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I don't see that as a realconstraint. We are operating, at least most of us here today, on arecognition that we have [to have] some further restraint because ofthe strength of the economy. We're not mechanically reacting to the[monetary growth] outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their perspective on a particular constraint and their recognition of the need for further restraint due to the strength of the economy.


Passage number 448.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: cannot find his hat, and he believes someone has taken it.


Passage number 449.
 Oh, I understand that, but I think--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. And, therefore, if the Chairman keepsenough flexibility, which I think he will, we can react to nominal GNPand the real economy. It seems to me that that would not be aconstraint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their understanding of a concept and expressing their belief or opinion about it. There is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 450.
MR. PARTEE. When we forecast I think we are slow torecognize a change in the inflection of the economy. We were slow torecognize the rate of increase that is now occurring and that we allsee. We will be slow to recognize the slowing, I think, and I wouldlike to guard against that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's opinion about the forecasting process and their desire to be cautious about potential mistakes in recognizing changes in the economy.


Passage number 451.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The more I think about this, I believe thesimplest thing to do is to rebase, if we're going to have a target fornext year, instead of having a complete hiatus. The key issue is whatwe say about the degree of weight that we give to Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is expressing their opinion and proposing a course of action, but there are no conflicting perspectives or arguments presented.


Passage number 452.
MR. MARTIN. I think that's right. And I think the market--almost regardless of what we say unless we just repudiate Ml, which I-42-7/12-13/83don't think is the consensus of this group--is still going to followit, put some weight on it, and think we are putting some weight on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 453.
MR. BLACK. We either rebase now or, if we overshoot ourtarget, we rebase at the end of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating two options or possibilities without expressing any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 454.
MR. PARTEE. That's true. That's quite true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The response "That's true. That's quite true." indicates agreement and affirmation.


Passage number 455.
MS. TEETERS. We may rebase now and have to do it again atthe end of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there may be a need to rebase now and potentially again at the end of the year.


Passage number 456.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "That is correct" implies agreement and confirmation.


Passage number 457.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, a technical point, which I wasstruggling to say in response to Governor Gramley's comment, has to doin some sense with the psychology of rebasing: Unless it turns outthat the numbers we get very soon show that July is extremely weak, ifyou rebase you still will be starting out well above that rebasedrange. You're above the one now, of course. But in any event, if youbase on the second quarter and plot July, you will be well above therange already. That may or may not have some implications for themarket, depending on how it's expressed and what you say in relationto it. But I think it's a factor that ought to be considered in theanalysis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing a technical point and suggesting that it should be considered in the analysis.


Passage number 458.
MR. WALLICH. Rebase on a shorter period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, is suggesting a shorter time period to rebase on, but there is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement presented.


Passage number 459.
MR. AXILROD. Well, you would have to rebase right on June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Axilrod is making a statement about a necessary action without contradicting any other ideas or opinions.


Passage number 460.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure, but I think what you'resaying is that if we had this 7 to 11 percent or whatever it is, we'dalso be above the 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. It shows uncertainty and a lack of understanding.


Passage number 461.
MR. AXILROD. That's right. It's not any different in fact;it's just the question of psychology.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the question of psychology, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 462.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It wouldn't be as much above the 11percent, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply expressing a guess or estimation about a value being less than 11 percent.


Passage number 463.
MR. AXILROD. But once you rebase, people will tend to lookat it and think you're much more serious about it, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Axilrod is expressing his belief that people will perceive the situation differently after rebasing, indicating that it would be seen as a more serious matter.


Passage number 464.
MR. KEEHN. Steve, are you saying that if we rebased usingthe second quarter, July would come in above 8 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a question where Mr. Keen is seeking clarification from Steve.


Passage number 465.
MR. AXILROD. Well, we're projecting [July growth] well abovethat at this moment. But even if it came in around 8 percent, I thinkMl would be above [the range] given the shape of the second quarter,which was very high toward the end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain a contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the projection of Mr. Axilrod and his belief that the projected growth rate would be above the given range. There is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 466.
 You are throwing yourselves intohigh--MR. BLACK. The great unknown is what is going to happen tothe velocity of M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that the velocity of M1 is uncertain.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 467.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think we ought to listen very carefully tothe substance of what Tony is saying, in the sense that it would be aterrible mistake to impose too much restraint in the second half ofthis year because Ml is going up faster than we now think it might, if-43-7/12-13/83the staff's forecast comes out right. But also, if we seem to saythat we have dismissed altogether the growth of Ml that is likely tobe interpreted, given the present concerns of the market, as [meaning]that we have dismissed any concern about inflation. And that wouldalso be unfortunate. I think we ought to find some way that avoidsboth of those problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. 

Explanation: Mr. Gramley is expressing concern that there could be a mistake in imposing too much restraint in the second half of the year due to the higher-than-expected growth of M1. However, he also acknowledges that dismissing the concerns about inflation completely could be interpreted negatively by the market. This suggests a disagreement or tension between the need to address the higher growth of M1 and the need to address concerns about inflation.


Passage number 468.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's also true that while the M1velocity has been off historically, the economy is doing a lot betterthan any other forecast implied except an Ml forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 469.
MR. GRAMLEY. Any Ml forecasts [unintelligible] would besomething like 6 to 8 percentage points off on nominal GNP growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 470.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A strict Ml forecast would have given muchhigher [GNP growth] than actually took place, but the fact is we arehigher than other forecasts, which suggests that there's no place in[unintelligible] it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating a fact that a strict Ml forecast would have given higher GNP growth than what actually occurred. However, it also acknowledges that the actual GNP growth is higher than other forecasts, implying that there is no disagreement in that aspect.


Passage number 471.
MR. GRAMLEY. To complete my thought, what I would do isrebase and tell the market this: We are not giving Ml any more weightnow than we have all year; our principal focus still is M2 because thevelocity of Ml is so terribly uncertain; there is some indication of areturn toward normalcy, but it is by no means clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and perspective without directly challenging or contradicting any other viewpoint.


Passage number 472.
MR. PARTEE. I would rebase and use 4 to 8 percent, but Iwould say to the market that we are still uncertain about velocity,though it looks as if it might be stabilizing and we're going to give[M1] some more weight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and uncertainty about a certain issue, but there is no indication of disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 473.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Stabilizing probably around a differenttrend.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply suggests that there may be a change in trend.


Passage number 474.
MR. PARTEE. Probably. I agree with that very much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker directly states their agreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 475.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We don't know precisely, but what I'd beinclined to say is that the 3 to 4 percent increase in velocity thatwe counted on we no longer count on.SEVERAL. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about something and stating their inclination or opinion.


Passage number 476.
MR. WALLICH. We know in any event that this is a function ofinterest rates; to keep emphasizing the velocity factor confuses thesituation. We don't refer to the interest sensitivity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Wallich is stating his opinion that keeping emphasis on the velocity factor confuses the situation, but there is no direct contention or disagreement mentioned.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 477.
MR. BLACK. Let me call your attention, if I might, to thelast sentence in Dave Lindsey's memo in which he says it's not clearthat Vl will be less predictable over time than V2 even though Vl maytake on behavioral characteristics that are different from earlierpostwar years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The disagreement is between Mr. Black and Dave Lindsey regarding the predictability of V1 and V2 over time. Mr. Black is suggesting that Dave Lindsey's statement is incorrect or unclear.


Passage number 478.
MR. MORRIS. That's faint praise, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. "That's faint praise, though" simply expresses the speaker's opinion about the previous statement without directly challenging or disagreeing with it.


Passage number 479.
MR. PARTEE. I absolutely agree with that; I think that'sjust what Paul said.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses complete agreement with what Paul said.


Passage number 480.
MR. BLACK. It has been more predictable over most of ourhistory; it may not be in the future, but I believe the burden of-44-7/12-13/83proof is on those who say it won't be. That's a biased viewpoint, asyou all probably can guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not have contention or disagreement. Mr. Black expresses his belief in a future that may be unpredictable, but he states that the burden of proof lies with those who claim otherwise. Although he acknowledges his biased viewpoint, there is no evident dispute or disagreement.


Passage number 481.
MR. GRAMLEY. The arrow is nice and straight; we just don'tknow which way it's going.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley is expressing uncertainty about the direction of the arrow, but there is no indication of any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 482.
MR. BLACK.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage as there is no context or content provided.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 483.
 I agree with that, but the risk--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The basic difference, or point ofdeparture, is that I am somewhat--in fact, substantially--surprisedthat we would stick our necks out with numbers where I, at least, feelthat we are not stabilizing along a particular trend. The fact thatvelocity was not as negative in the last couple of months as it wasearlier in the year, and granted all the Ms had negative velocity lastyear, [does not alter the fact that] the situation is so sensitive tothe changing way people hold balances. I hear people talk about it inthe banks and in the markets. I don't see how we have even a pretenseof a scientific basis for working with and making projections on thebasis of what may be a very unpredictable velocity situation. I don'tunderstand why we would stick our necks out because we can do enoughtightening based on the movements of M2, M3, and credit and the realeconomy without setting out a series of projections that have betterthan a 50-50 chance of turning out to be wrong again. I don't reallyunderstand; I guess many of you, including maybe the staff, must havemuch more faith that the range of predictability is going to besubstantially narrowed. I don't believe that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses disagreement and skepticism about the decision to make projections based on velocity and the predictability of the situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 484.
MR. WALLICH. I just think that there is such a thing as Mland the market watches it. And [if] we ignore it, we're losingcredibility as well as probably [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, Mr. Wallich believes that there is a concept called "M" that the market watches, and if it is ignored, it would lead to a loss of credibility. Others may disagree with this viewpoint or be skeptical of the existence or importance of "M".


Passage number 485.
MR. MORRIS. The market watches it because we watch it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
The passage does not show any disagreement or contention. It simply explains that the market watches something because "we" (presumably the author and his/her colleagues) watch it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 486.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Exactly. Market participants watchit when they think it's influencing our behavior. Secondly, we aregoing to lose credibility with certain kinds of people anyway if wemove to 7 to 11 percent or rebase and wipe out the past. That will begiving Ml more importance, no matter what. Of course, I'll admitthere is a way. Paul could go back to the Humphrey-Hawkins Februaryversion rather than the April version. But even then I think it isgoing to be harder to get back to the February market reaction to Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the phrases "we are going to lose credibility" and "it is going to be harder to get back to the February market reaction to Ml." These statements suggest a disagreement or differing opinions on the potential consequences and effectiveness of certain actions.


Passage number 487.
MR. CORRIGAN. The February reaction to Ml was at least inpart couched in terms of what was going on in the economy. Mostpeople thought the economy was still declining in February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about people's perception of the economy in February.


Passage number 488.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Okay. But it is still true that whenyou talk to market people in New York you feel that Ml is halfway backagain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 489.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's a combination of the economybeing strong and M1 being so high. People wouldn't be so sensitive ifthe economy were weak and Ml were even 3 percentage points from itsrange.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply stating their opinion about the possible reasons for people's sensitivity, suggesting a combination of a strong economy and a high M1 as the contributing factors.


Passage number 490.
MR. ROBERTS. I don't think it's so much that the market sayswe're watching it as that they say it's something that has to belooked at if the economy is strong and Ml is growing too rapidly.-45-7/12-13/83Whether we're watching it or not, it has become a market influence.You talk to people, as you say; I also talk to people and I get theimpression that they're concerned about what is happening to Mlwhether we are concerned or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Roberts is simply acknowledging that whether or not they are actively watching Ml, the market still considers it as a significant factor.


Passage number 491.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Sure, you hear various sentiments.But those whom I believe are the more astute observers in thefinancial community make a point of saying that we ought to be moresensitive to the real economy than to Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply presents a viewpoint that suggests being more sensitive to the real economy rather than Ml, which is supported by the more astute observers in the financial community.


Passage number 492.
 There's a fear around also,and I have that fear, that we ourselves are going to feel--and themarket will perceive us as being--more locked into M1 if we go aheadwith it and dignify what has been happening with--MR. ROBERTS. I think the problem is that the market fearsthat we are getting too far away from Ml; as the economy hasstrengthened and as M1 has grown at too rapid a pace, that hasproduced fears. It's already reflected in a major change in interestrates in the market. If we were to do something to indicate that weare serious about it again, particularly if we were to rebase and havea moderate rate of growth as our target, I think we would see aconstructive effect in the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Both speakers express a fear or concern about the market perceiving them as being more locked into M1 and the potential negative effects of that perception. Speaker one mentions the fear, while speaker two agrees with the fear and adds additional information about the market's current concerns.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 493.
MR. PARTEE. Well, there are all kinds of opinions. I thinkyou are both overstating it. You have looked at the extremes. Myview of the matter is that history shows that it's dangerous in anexpansion to rely on setting the federal funds rate. We are nowmoving into expansion. We're talking about the next year and a halfby which time we will be pretty well along in the expansion. Theindication is--certainly over the 20 years that I've seen it--that theCommittee is slow to change the funds rate if the funds rate is whatthe Committee is setting. So, I think there's a basic danger in nothaving something else. Now, something else might be nominal GNP; Idon't think it's real GNP. Or it might be one of the Ms. And if it'sone of the Ms, I think Ml still shows itself as better than any of theother Ms. It could be total credit, but on total credit our problemis that it's too hard to estimate the current numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee disagrees with the previous speakers and believes that relying solely on setting the federal funds rate during an expansion is dangerous. He suggests having another indicator, such as nominal GNP or one of the Ms, like M1. However, he acknowledges that estimating the current numbers for total credit is difficult.


Passage number 494.
 We might useit for confirmation, but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me suggest something with greathesitancy because I'm not sure I like it visually but substantively itgives me an easy explanation: Make the range 5 to 9 percent and saythat the 9 percent allows for no change in velocity during theexpansion. Maybe that's the new trend of things and we want to allowfor that possibility. The 5 percent allows for a fairly normal, oralmost normal, cyclical change in velocity from now on. And that'sprecisely why we picked 5 to 9 percent, because the 9 percent allowsfor no change in velocity and the 5 percent allows for a sizablechange in velocity. That still leaves open how much weight we put onit, but we picked 5 to 9 percent because that covers the probablerange of uncertainty that we see in velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker suggests a range of 5 to 9 percent to account for the uncertainty in velocity and to allow for the possibility of no change in velocity. The speaker explains the reasoning behind the range without expressing any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 495.
MR. PARTEE. So, what we have in mind is a 9 percent nominalGNP, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating what they have in mind.


Passage number 496.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, because it is consistent with thenominal GNP growth that we are predicting. Precisely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply acknowledging that the prediction of nominal GNP growth aligns with the given information.


Passage number 497.
MR. BLACK. Is that rebased, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question asked is simply inquiring about the rebase and does not involve any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 498.
-46-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible.] That is my startingpoint: We are going to be presenting a forecast of roughly 9 percentor a bit more than 9 percent for nominal GNP next year, so we relateit to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 499.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Let me ask a question. Even though Iprefer 5 to 9 percent over 4 to 8 percent, certainly in terms of theimmediate market effect, is it feasible to say that we're coming upwith 5 to 9 percent and yet we are going to continue deemphasizing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking a question and discussing an individual's preference for a specific percentage range.


Passage number 500.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't particularly like showing thishigh a range and that's my reservation about it, but I can see arather pat explanation being given--precisely: We projected, roughly,9 percent nominal GNP growth next year, gentlemen. We think byimplication that that is a satisfactory outcome. We feel that we arein the midst of velocity changes of a continuing sort that we can'tquite identify--or we may say that we're not putting full weight onMl. Based upon everything we've seen so far and assuming we're in aperiod of expansion, we think it's likely that the velocity patternwill not change so greatly that we would actually get a biggerincrease in Ml from now on than in the nominal GNP, so that's why wepicked 9 percent at the top. The 5 percent allows for a less thannormal, but not all that much less than normal, increase in velocityin this particular cyclical period. So, we kind of span as best wecan the range of uncertainty that we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 501.
MR. BALLES. That's a good idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The statement "That's a good idea" indicates agreement and support.


Passage number 502.
MR. WALLICH. That seems to say that you are accepting thatthe causal influence goes from GNP to M1 and that there's no counter-flow of causality.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply describes an observation made by Mr. Wallich without presenting any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 503.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think I quite said that. It mayhave sounded that way when I worded it. But I can word it the otherway: that if there is no change in velocity, the 9 percent would bethe appropriate [number]. That gets the causality the other way. Andif there is a change in velocity, we would want to have a lower M1 andthat's why we have the lower end [at 5 percent].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Instead, it demonstrates a clarification and alternative explanation of a previous statement.


Passage number 504.
MR. WALLICH. But looking at this as a target, suppose M1were growing at 9 percent but unfortunately velocity was growing at 4percent, as it could. That is what I see as the problem of thistarget.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a hypothetical situation and the problem that the speaker sees with that target.


Passage number 505.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That would be too high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "That would be too high" does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply suggests that the speaker believes a certain value or level is excessive or unacceptable.


Passage number 506.
MR. PARTEE. I like that the real target is the nominal GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a personal preference or opinion, without opposing or contradicting any other viewpoint.


Passage number 507.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but what I would be saying implicitlyis that if we have 4 percent velocity growth we may not know it untilex post. That's the problem. But if we thought we were getting that,the 9 percent is too high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation:
The passage does not present any direct contention or disagreement. It discusses a potential issue and presents a hypothetical scenario. There is no explicit disagreement or conflicting viewpoints expressed.


Passage number 508.
MS. HORN. We might know it ex post but at least it wouldonly be 4 months ex post, not a half year or a year ex post. So, it'sshortening the period of uncertainty.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Horn is expressing her opinion about the benefits of knowing something after a shorter period of time.


Passage number 509.
MR. BALLES. Paul, is this suggestion both for '83 and '84.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 510.
-47-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, as I say, I throw it out as asuggestion. The one thing I don't like about it is that it lookspretty high on the face of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion about something they don't like, but there is no opposition or argument presented.


Passage number 511.
MR. BLACK. Particularly for next year, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about opinions, conflicting viewpoints, or arguments related to the statement made by Mr. Black. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement evident in the passage.


Passage number 512.
MR. BALLES. But was it for both years. Is that afterrebasing 1983.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is a simple clarification question about the timing of a specific event.


Passage number 513.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm attracted to it simply because I thinkit's fairly easy to explain, given the GNP forecast we have--if wethink that's an appropriate GNP forecast. Actually, it's going tocome out 9-1/2 percent, I guess. I don't know where the centraltendency is; we have these medians here. But I'm assuming the centraltendency is someplace around--8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent would be ideal Isuppose--8-3/4 to 9-3/4 percent or 8-3/4 to 9-1/2 percent or someplacein that area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing their own thoughts and assumptions about the GNP forecast.


Passage number 514.
MR. KEEHN. Not to complicate it, but what if we use the 5 to9 percent for this year and then suggest that if velocity begins toreturn to a more normal pattern as we get into 1984 we mightcontemplate a reduction and go back to the 4 to 8 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is proposing a possible approach, suggesting that if velocity returns to a more normal pattern in 1984, a reduction in percentage could be considered.


Passage number 515.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's kind of fine-tuning in an uncertainperiod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "That's kind of fine-tuning in an uncertain period" is a statement or observation, without any conflicting opinions or dispute present.


Passage number 516.
MS. TEETERS. We could just not even mention a target for1984 and see where we are at the end of the year because we may verywell have to rebase again then if [Ml growth] doesn't come down. Andcertainly the velocity changes are still going on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Ms. Teeters discussing the possibility of not setting a target for 1984 and the potential need to rebase again in the future. The mention of velocity changes does not indicate any disagreement either.


Passage number 517.
MR. ROBERTS. But don't we have to talk about next year,Paul.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts is simply asking a question about discussing next year.


Passage number 518.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have to talk about next year; we don'tnecessarily have to give an M1 target. But if we didn't give one forthis year, I don't see much reason not to give one for next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the possibility of giving an M1 target for the next year, and acknowledges that there may not be a strong reason to not give one since it was not given for the current year.


Passage number 519.
 Wecan say we don't pay much attention to it, but--MR. PARTEE. It seems to me that the principle is the one youstate and then, of course, it's subject to review as more evidencecomes in on what velocity is in fact doing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the principle and the need for review as more evidence becomes available.


Passage number 520.
MR. CORRIGAN. That 5 to 9 percent sounds nice but I don'tlike it partly because of where I think the risks are. If there issome strong sympathy that way, I'd rather see us rebase off June anduse 4 to 8 percent, which would give the same practical result anyway.I really think that saying 5 to 9 percent in the context of everythingthat's going on, at least as I look at it, is very troubling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 521.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are going to have great trouble gettinga central tendency when I look at these numbers. We have a wholebunch at a high level and we have a bunch at a lower level and there'snothing in between. It worked out pretty well last time, but itceratainly doesn't work out very well this time if my glance at theseis clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that they are going to have trouble finding a central tendency in the numbers because there are a bunch of high and low values with nothing in between. This suggests that the speaker does not believe that using a central tendency measure will accurately represent the data and disagrees with using it based on their initial observation.


Passage number 522.
 The central tendency---48-7/12-13/83MR. BLACK. What may explain some part of that is a differentpolicy [assumption] or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents a possibility that a different policy or assumption could explain some part of the central tendency mentioned.


Passage number 523.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The central tendency on the nominal GNPwill come out at 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent or maybe even 9-1/2 to 10percent. We have 10 people between 9-1/2 and 10 percent, roughly, or11 people between 9-1/2 and 10.2 percent. So, I guess we can say thecentral tendency is roughly 9-1/2 to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply presenting information about the central tendency of the nominal GNP and using approximations to convey the range of values.


Passage number 524.
MR. BLACK. Well, you can cut that 9 percent down to 8percent by assuming a little pickup in velocity rather than no change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Black, simply suggests a way to reduce the 9 percent to 8 percent by assuming a slight increase in velocity.


Passage number 525.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think what we would say with 4 to 8percent in any event is that we are assuming a little increase invelocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their belief or opinion about a certain topic, which is not met with any opposing views or contradictions.


Passage number 526.
MR. BLACK. You could stress the point that Jerry just made aminute ago in that way, which is not an unreasonable thing to assume.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that stressing the point that Jerry made earlier is a reasonable assumption.


Passage number 527.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Actually 4 percent would give a 5-1/2percent increase in velocity; that's pretty high even by historicalstandards.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement provides a fact or assertion without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 528.
MR. ROBERTS. I thought it was over 6 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states their belief or assumption about the percentage without any conflicting opinions or arguments presented.


Passage number 529.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage "MR. AXILROD." The passage only presents a name without any further information or details that would involve disagreement or contention.


Passage number 530.
 Well, if you are talking about the second halfof '83, but if you get into '84, the second year probably--MR. CORRIGAN. It's quite high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing a timeframe and stating that something is quite high.


Passage number 531.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know. Maybe I'm beginning to like5 to 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing uncertainty or indecisiveness.


Passage number 532.
MR. BLACK. We could go to 10 percent and assume a small dropin velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black is presenting an idea or suggestion, without any opposing views or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 533.
MR. WALLICH. It seems to be mainly accommodative and muchless leaning against the pressures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any clear contention or disagreement. It simply describes a particular approach or stance, stating that it is mainly accommodative and less leaning against pressures.


Passage number 534.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's look at what we're saying with 4 to8 percent. If we take the average of these forecasts, we're saying weexpect velocity to be between plus 6 and plus 2. Do you want toadjust the 4 to 8 percent or would you say between plus 5 and plus 1.That's the difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is simply discussing the range of forecasts and suggesting alternative options for adjusting the numbers.


Passage number 535.
MR. WALLICH. This could be a period of somewhat risinginterest rates, possibly, and that would accelerate velocity. Thecyclical pattern certainly is one of some velocity gain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 536.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, all of these would allow somevelocity gain. The midpoint would be a plus 3 or 4 velocity gain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a consensus that all of the mentioned options would result in a velocity gain, and specifies that the midpoint would provide a velocity gain of plus 3 or 4.


Passage number 537.
MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, when you look at velocityhistorically, though, I think the potential for a rise in velocity hasto be related directly to the actual decline in velocity. And thereare all those balances sitting there and we can't ignore them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Corrigan is stating his perspective and making a point about the potential relationship between velocity and decline in velocity. There is no indication of disagreement or conflicting views from other speakers.


Passage number 538.
-49-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you saying velocity may rise more thanthe normal cyclical pattern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple mathematical expression and a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 539.
MR. CORRIGAN. I think that is a very distinct possibility,yes. We just can't ignore all that money that's sitting there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Corrigan is expressing his belief that there is a possibility of significant money being left untouched, and he emphasizes the importance of not ignoring it.


Passage number 540.
MR. BLACK. I think that is where the risks lie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement made by Mr. Black about his personal opinion on where risks may lie.


Passage number 541.
MR. CORRIGAN. That's where I think they lie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their belief.


Passage number 542.
MR. WALLICH. When this is compared with the old range of2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, people aren't going to keep in mind that thisis a different Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, is simply stating that when comparing the current range of interest rates with the previous range, people may not take into account the difference in the measurement of M1 (a measure of money supply).


Passage number 543.
MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, I'm starting from the point thatI'd like to preserve M1 for some time when it becomes more importantinformationally. But this discussion has just reinforced my view thatwe shouldn't rebase at the moment. We shouldn't be talking about 5 to9 percent or anything else because it gives much more credence tothose numbers than anybody around this table is able to assign tothem, at least by a consensus. And thus it seems to me that we shoulddrop back and use the 7 to 11 percent, which recognizes that we had anovershoot in the first half that we can't explain and we don't knowwhat is going to happen in the second half. An 11 percent topsuggests to anybody who chooses to figure it out--and the monetaristsand market people or others will do so--about a 6-1/2 increase for theremainder of this year. And in view of the uncertainty, that isn'tunreasonable. As a result, I would go to the 7 to 11 percent nowwithout rebasing and maybe talk about it sometime in the future. And[for 1984] I'd go to 4 to 8 percent, which we established in Februaryof this year, in view of the uncertainty. The uncertainty stillexists for 1984 and we will have the opportunity to change it inFebruary of 1984. The result, it seems to me, is that we're accordingless precision to M1 and it's more attuned to the discussion we justhad around this table. Nobody knows. So, why should we elevate it bychanging it and assigning some precision to it, even with all thelanguage that you suggested that if velocity increases at thehistorical rate or if it's at zero--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no explicit dissent or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Guffey is expressing his own viewpoint and suggesting a course of action, but he does not directly challenge or contradict anyone else's ideas or opinions.


Passage number 544.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I think we have to say that anyway fornext year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and stating that they believe something needs to be said or done for the upcoming year.


Passage number 545.
 The official is less different than--MR. GUFFEY. To be sure, the uncertainty involved is velocityand its relationship to income. But to do the things we are talkingabout--one rebasing it and then establishing a 5 to 9 percent rangeand trying to explain it for the remainder of 1983--seems to me to beelevating it beyond the point that I'd like to see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It is discussing the uncertainty involved in velocity and its relationship to income, and the author's preference for not giving excessive importance to the topic.


Passage number 546.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The only difficulty with 4 to 8 percentfor next year--it's not a substantive one, I guess--is that we'regoing to be projecting, unless these [forecasts] change, a 9-3/4 to 10percent average nominal GNP. That projection is going to bepublished. And a 4 to 8 percent range says that velocity is going toincrease by from 2 percent to 6 percent. Is that what we want to say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing a potential issue or concern regarding a projection for nominal GNP and velocity increase.


Passage number 547.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, as I've just suggested, in February weestablished a 4 to 8 percent range, describing some uncertainty. Andthe report to Congress had nominal GNP of [7-1/4] to 11-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about establishing a range and reporting it to Congress.


Passage number 548.
-50-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And the average of that was 9 percent,roughly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 549.
MR. GUFFEY. 9 percent, roughly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any context or information that would suggest contention or disagreement. It simply states a numerical figure without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or conflicting statements.


Passage number 550.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And we said 4 to 8 percent against thebackground of cyclical increases in velocity of 6 percent or more inthe first year recovery. Now we're in the second year of recovery,and we've had two more quarters of low velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is presenting factual information about the velocity of recovery in the first and second year without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 551.
MR. GUFFEY. Therefore, it gives the background of sayingthat we'll just reestablish the 4 to 8 percent because we don't knowwhat will happen and we'll look at it [again] in February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Guffey stating a statement about reestablishing the 4 to 8 percent and reviewing it again in February.


Passage number 552.
MR. ROBERTS. We have gone from an 11 percent rate of[velocity] decrease to about a 1 percent rate of decrease in thatperiod, suggesting that it's straightening out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 553.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, any of these ranges allows for anincrease in velocity. And they all assume that [some] degree ofnormality will return; it's just a question of the degree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents different possibilities for an increase in velocity and acknowledges the assumption that normality will eventually return.


Passage number 554.
MR. BOEHNE. I think there's something to what Roger says.If the conversation added up to anything around the table, it is thatnobody really knows enough about M1 to be very confident. We couldsay for next year that the Ml range is 4 to 8 percent and that assumesa velocity of 2 to 6--and use whatever rationale you feel comfortablewith to say it--and say that if that doesn't work, we'll simply haveto adjust Ml again. That strikes me as conveying the notion that wehave some expectation that Ml will return to a more normal path, butwe're not very confident of it. And if it doesn't, we are not goingto base monetary policy on something that isn't dependable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Boehne expressing his agreement with Roger's point and suggesting a potential approach to dealing with the uncertainty about M1.


Passage number 555.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody have the figures handy as towhat the velocity has been historically in the second year ofexpansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is asking a question to obtain factual information about historical data. There is no disagreement or contention expressed.


Passage number 556.
MR. MORRIS. For M1 it has been 2.7 in the last threeexpansions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Morris is giving a numerical value for M1 in the last three expansions, which is stated as 2.7. There is no contention or disagreement presented in this statement.


Passage number 557.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Only 2.7.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Only 2.7" is a factual statement without any conflicting viewpoints or controversial claims.


Passage number 558.
MR. GRAMLEY. In the second year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 559.
MR. MORRIS. That's the second year. It's higher in thefirst year; it's 5.2 in the first year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply providing information about the data.


Passage number 560.
MR. CORRIGAN. Well, the issue here is not to agree on howmuch we know about Ml for this year. I don't think we know a helluvalot about either [year]. But the problem that I think we ought toavoid is having a set of targets that won't provide the opportunity totighten up further if we have to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Corrigan's statement is focused on expressing his opinion and suggesting a potential problem to avoid in the future.


Passage number 561.
 And if we have targets like 11percent or even 9 percent--MR. BOEHNE. But remember that this Ml number can be put inthe context of a reduction in the targets for the broader aggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact about the context of the Ml number and the reduction in targets for broader aggregates.


Passage number 562.
-51-7/12-13/83MR. CORRIGAN. But the broader aggregates don't reallyprovide much of a mechanism--or they have not provided much of amechanism--to permit this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the limitations of broader aggregates in facilitating a specific outcome.


Passage number 563.
MR. MORRIS. And Ml has.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It appears to be a quote or statement from someone named Mr. Morris.


Passage number 564.
MR. CORRIGAN. We can use it; we don't have to. I'm notsaying we would. But as a practical matter, it does give us theopportunity to move if we think we have to move. And that's what I'mconcerned about--having a set of targets that gives us the flexibilityeven though we may not use it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The speaker is stating their opinion about using the targets and expressing concern about having flexibility. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 565.
MR. PARTEE. I agree with Jerry. I think we ought to rebase,but then I'm scared of the 5 to 9 percent so I'd fuzz a little on thevelocity but say we are keeping it open.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in the passage. Mr. Partee is expressing his agreement with Jerry's suggestion and shares his worries about the potential percentage impact.


Passage number 566.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Would you base it on June, then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: This is a simple question asking for a preference or opinion. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage.


Passage number 567.
MR. PARTEE. Sure. I think the concept here is that what hashappened has been unusual. And now we're going to be following Ml inthe expectation that there will be some small rise in velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's belief that the concept being discussed is that something unusual has occurred, and they are now expecting a small rise in velocity.


Passage number 568.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The whole spectrum of short-terminterest rates is really behaving as though the fed funds rate werecloser to 9-1/2 percent than to the 9-1/8 percent rate of the last fewdays. So, if we raise expectations [by] having 4 to 8 percent basedon the second quarter, we are going to get even more of a reaction inthe market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 569.
MR. PARTEE. But I said I'd base it on June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee is simply stating that he agreed to base something on June.


Passage number 570.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Basing it on June seems awfully fussy tome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement simply expresses a personal opinion without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 571.
MR. PARTEE. But it's basing it on where we are, which Iwould define as June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply providing his own definition of where they are in relation to the topic being discussed.


Passage number 572.
MR. GRAMLEY. You get a lot by way of money growth; that'sworth $10 billion in Ml, I think. The second-quarter average is $505billion and June is $515 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the amount of money growth and its value.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 573.
MR. GUFFEY. Rebasing suggests that we know more about whatM1 is going to do in the future than I think anybody around the tableis willing to admit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, believes that the concept of rebasing implies that the people present in the discussion have more knowledge about the future behavior of M1 than they are willing to acknowledge.


Passage number 574.
MR. CORRIGAN. I think one can make the argument the otherway around. Rebasing, depending upon how we articulate it, can beconstrued to say that we had this unusual period and we're recognizingthat it's unusual. We are cutting the umbilical cord from it andwe're going from there. That clearly leaves open the option anddemonstrates our willingness to do something like that again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 575.
MR. GUFFEY. It seems to me that the market would suggestthat M1 is going to become a greater focus of policy implementation.And I'm not prepared at this moment to start looking at Ml as a policyguide because I don't think we know what is going to happen in theperiod ahead any more than we knew what would happen or how we canexplain what happened in the last six months or nine months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing uncertainty about future events and the speaker's hesitation to use M1 as a policy guide.


Passage number 576.
-52-7/12-13/83MS. TEETERS. That argues, though, for just ignoring Ml--don't set a target for this year or don't set one for next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is suggesting that it may be beneficial to ignore Ml (which could refer to a certain measurement or variable), and not set a target for the current year or the following year.


Passage number 577.
MR. GUFFEY. I'd just like to clarify that point. I wouldnot want to ignore Ml totally and not set any targets at all because Ithink M1 has served us very well, both politically and economically inthe past and it will need to do so in the future. I wouldn't want tomove totally away from it. I'd like to preserve it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 578.
MS. TEETERS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement based solely on the phrase "MS. TEETERS."


Passage number 579.
 But if we eliminate the ranges temporarilyuntil we have a relationship back, I think that signals the marketsthat we're not [focusing on Ml] even more strongly--MR. GUFFEY. But then when we move back to it, it will be thesole target as far as the markets are concerned. If we eliminate itand then reinstitute it when we think it has some validity again, thenthe markets are going to pick it up as being the sole target formonetary policy. And in my view it shouldn't have been totally theguide in the past and shouldn't be in the future. Again, I thinkyou're according it something that I would not be prepared to do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both speakers express their agreement that eliminating the ranges temporarily gives the signal that the focus is not on M1. They also agree that if the ranges are reintroduced, the markets will view it as the sole target for monetary policy. Additionally, both speakers agree that they do not believe M1 should be the sole guide for monetary policy.


Passage number 580.
MR. CORRIGAN. If Ml is growing at 12 percent, I don't careif we have a target or not, the market is going to look at it andwe're going to get interest rate effects. We can't wish that away.It's just not going to go away.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Corrigan, is expressing a clear opinion about the market and future interest rate effects. There is no disagreement or contention present in this passage.


Passage number 581.
MR. GUFFEY. The other approach, though, provides someflexibility to us in the period ahead when the uncertainty is still ata very high level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not demonstrate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply explaining that one approach provides more flexibility in a time of uncertainty.


Passage number 582.
MR. BLACK. A lot of the reasons for that uncertainty havedisappeared, Roger. It may well behave more predictably now than ithas in the recent past. I hope so and I know you hope so. Of course,none of us knows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there was uncertainty in the past but that it may be more predictable now, with both parties expressing hope for this outcome.


Passage number 583.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What are the Administration's and CBO'sprojections for nominal GNP next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward question asking for the projections of the Administration and CBO for nominal GNP next year.


Passage number 584.
MR. KICHLINE. I don't know about [CBO]; the Administration'snominal GNP is 9.7 percent for 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement of fact.


Passage number 585.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. CBO is out of date.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is not expressing contention or disagreement but rather stating a fact. It suggests that the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) is not up-to-date with the latest information or methods.


Passage number 586.
 There isn'tmuch--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It sticks in my craw a bit--we're back at9-3/4 percent. That's about where we will be. If we say 4 to 8percent, we're saying velocity is going to increase by the normalcyclical amount even if we're in the high end of the range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply expressing their frustration or dissatisfaction with the situation.


Passage number 587.
MR. ROBERTS. If we hit it right in the middle and have anormal cyclical velocity, we're right on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presented as a hypothetical scenario and there is no indication of conflicting opinions or opposing ideas.


Passage number 588.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 589.
 On 8 or technically 7--MR. ROBERTS. Yes, it's just as important not to pull it backtoo much as it is to have the right amount.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating that it is equally important to not pull something back too much as it is to have the right amount.


Passage number 590.
-53-7/12-13/83MR. PARTEE. That argues for 5 to 9 percent, analytically--noquestion about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a fact or observation rather than an argument.


Passage number 591.
MR. WALLICH. Well, it gets to be very close to saying thatMl has become like M2 and M3. One reason I can see for saying that isthat M1 now accumulates interest as a result of interest being paid[on NOW accounts] and so it has an upward bias that it didn't used tohave. Whether that is very important, I don't know. But I thinkthere is a difference between Ml and M2 and we ought to show that inthe range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents different viewpoints and observations regarding the classification of M1, M2, and M3. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 592.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The argument that I hear against 5 to 9percent, apart from something cosmetic, is: Suppose velocity is highand we want to tighten up and we're well within the 9 percent. Iguess the answer to that has to be that if that's true, M2 and M3 andcredit must be running high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 593.
MR. GRAMLEY. Not necessarily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: The passage only provides a statement without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 594.
MR. PARTEE. I don't see that.SPEAKER(.). I don't think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. Partee and the speaker seem to be in agreement.


Passage number 595.
MR. GRAMLEY. The argument for a big increase in velocity andslow growth in Ml is that we had this big cyclical drop in velocity,which relates to higher interest rate sensitivity in demand for NOWaccounts and changes in compensating balance practices as interestrates go up. And I think the implicit argument here, which we oughtto lay on the table, is that interest rates are going up a good bitmore than the staff has forecast and that slows down Ml growth a lot,so we need to keep a low range for that reason. I worry about thatabout as much as I worry about the problem that Chuck posed earlier,which is that the economy may hit the rocks and Ml growth may slowdown for that reason. I think both of those are protecting againstbeing run over by a herd of stampeding elephants in Washington at highnoon. The main problem we're going to have, I think, is that we havea fairly strong economy that's going to pull a lot of money growthout. And the question is what we want to do about that. Do we wantto ignore it or not. I would be prepared to put very little weight ongrowth of Ml, but I don't think we ought to tell the publicinadvertently that we're giving up on the fight against inflation.So, I think Jerry's suggestion of basing on June makes good sensebecause I don't think we ought to constrain ourselves too much. Thenwe can use 4 to 8 percent and it sounds better. Cosmetically, itsounds better. And I think we can finesse this business of velocityin 1984; that's no problem. No one really knows what is going tohappen to velocity anyway so we just make some arguments for [thepossibility that] it may go up or it may not and we'll be all right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their own thoughts and concerns but does not engage in any argument or debate with others.


Passage number 596.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" simply refers to a person, without any indication of disagreement or conflict.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 597.
 We can make some arguments that it may goup; we can't make any that it may not because then we have to--MR. GRAMLEY. No, if we say it may not go up, we're saying ineffect that we're not going to put much weight on Ml until we seenormal patterns of M1/GNP relationships restored. And if, in fact,when we get to 1984, it takes 10 percent growth in Ml to have a decenteconomy, we're prepared to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Gramley disagrees with the statement that we can't make any arguments that it may not go up. He argues that if we say it may not go up, we are suggesting that the weight on M1 will not be significant until normal patterns of M1/GNP relationships are restored. He also suggests that if a 10 percent growth in M1 is needed for a decent economy in 1984, they are prepared to do that.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 598.
-54-7/12-13/83MR. CORRIGAN. I don't see that as a problem. If we're facedwith the situation later this year or next year where velocity isn'tgrowing, I think it's a fairly easy matter to make that kind ofadjustment both in policy and what we say about policy. But I don'tthink the reverse follows. If we have a target that's 5 to 9 percentand money supply is growing at 9 percent and the economy is growinglike gangbusters, how do you go up [on the Hill] and explain thatwe're tightening when we're within our target range. I think it's areal problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Corrigan, is asserting that it would be difficult to explain tightening policies when the target range for money supply growth is being met. This implies that there is disagreement or contention surrounding the appropriate course of action in such a scenario.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 599.
MS. TEETERS. We change targets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Teeters, suggests changing targets, which implies that there was a previous decision or plan in place that is being challenged or opposed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 600.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We can do 4 to 9 percent based on thesecond quarter, which also is a practical way of showing the marketthat we're de-emphasizing M1 to some degree. They don't reallybelieve as much as I think some of you people around here believe thatwe have de-emphasized Ml. I keep mentioning this point. Sure, it hasbeen reinforced by the strength of the real economy; I understandthat. But there's a revision to the old thinking more and more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in this passage. The speaker mentions that some people around them don't believe that they have de-emphasized M1 as much as others may think. This suggests a difference in opinions or viewpoints on the issue.


Passage number 601.
MR. MARTIN. Jerry, I think we go up to the Congress and tellthem that we're tightening because the economy is growing above therate anticipated and we're beginning to see the first signs ofinflation. I don't think we go up and make an argument based on theMs at all. We make an economic argument.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is expressing his opinion on how to approach a situation and suggesting a course of action. There is no mention of other voices or opposing viewpoints in the passage.


Passage number 602.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But how can we say we see the firstsigns of inflation. What do we point to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is posing a question and seeking evidence or examples to support the claim of seeing the first signs of inflation.


Passage number 603.
MR. MARTIN. Well, if the economy is growing very, very[rapidly]. That was the assumption Jerry made.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin simply restates an assumption made by Jerry.


Passage number 604.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think he has a basis forsaying that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no mention of anyone else's opinion or any opposing views. The speaker simply expresses their own doubt or disagreement without engaging in any contention or disagreement with others.


Passage number 605.
MR. CORRIGAN. There's somewhat of an historical tendency tobe unwilling to do that in this Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a historical tendency of the Committee without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas being presented.


Passage number 606.
MR. MARTIN. That was his assumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is expressing his assumption, which implies that he is not presenting a conflicting viewpoint or engaging in an argument.


Passage number 607.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without providing any specific context or information about what Chairman Solomon is discussing or stating.


Passage number 608.
 If the exchange rate--MR. MARTIN. I'm not talking about today. I'm talking abouthis scenario, Tony.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply clarifying that they are referring to a specific scenario mentioned earlier.


Passage number 609.
MR. CORRIGAN. The problem is that there's a reluctance to dothat even in the confines of this Committee, much less to go up andtell Congress that that is what we are doing. I don't give a darnabout M1 in and of itself either. My concern is simply that weformulate policy in a way that it provides us with flexibility to dowhat has to be done, if indeed it has to be done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Corrigan voices his concern about the reluctance to formulate policy that allows for flexibility to address necessary actions.


Passage number 610.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" simply mentions the title or position of someone without providing any context or information that would indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 611.
 Gosh, I would hate to rebase on June but--MS. TEETERS. Well, take Tony's [suggestion] and make it 4 to9 percent and base it on the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individuals are discussing a suggestion and considering implementing it, without expressing any opposing views or disagreement.


Passage number 612.
-55-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd almost prefer to make it 8 to 12percent for the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing a personal preference regarding a percentage.


Passage number 613.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, 7 to 11 percent puts some restraint on M1over the last half of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, Mr. Guffey is stating a fact or observation about the restraint on M1 over the last half of the year. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 614.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 7 to 11 percent is exactly the same as [8]to 12 percent based on the second quarter.SPEAKER(.). Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker is stating that the range of 7 to 11 percent is the same as the range of 8 to 12 percent based on the second quarter. This statement suggests that there is agreement between the two ranges.


Passage number 615.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I made some calculations when Iwas fiddling with this. Growth of 12 percent for the year would giveyou about 8 or 8-1/2 percent from June to December. That's about a 10percent rate from Q2 to Q4.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 616.
MR. BOEHNE. Does that show July above or below the target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for clarification.


Passage number 617.
MR. AXILROD. I would assume it's above, but I'd have tocheck. Oh, I'm sure it's above.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement showing uncertainty and lack of confirmation.


Passage number 618.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not include any content or statements that indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 619.
 Of course, if it's slow in the second quarter--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What has it been so far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply posing a question about the current status of something, without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 620.
MR. AXILROD. For the year-to-date it's around 13 percent.As of June, from a fourth-quarter base it was running 13.8 percent.So, it's 5.8 percentage points above the June level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents factual information about the percentage increase from a certain base level.


Passage number 621.
MR. ROBERTS. June was 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only provides information about the percentage of something in June.


Passage number 622.
MR. AXILROD. I meant above the June target level. And thegrowth rate for Ml from the fourth quarter to the second quarter isabout 13-1/4 percent. Either way it's very strong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the growth rate of M1.


Passage number 623.
 Our projectionfor the third quarter, for what it's worth--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If it's 13.8 percent now, we're almost at14 percent so if we have 11 percent for the year, it has to come downto 8 percent for the rest of the year. That's simple arithmetic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating their projection and describing a calculation based on simple arithmetic.


Passage number 624.
MR. BOEHNE. You are the number one salesman on this, Mr.Chairman. What do you feel most comfortable with trying to sell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 625.
MR. BLACK. One interesting thing that makes it a littleeasier is that under any of these short-term alternatives, the thirdquarter looks fairly high in an absolute sense. Any of these short-term alternatives that we're looking at would imply a third-quarterrate that really doesn't look like much drop from the second-quarterrate. It's just pure arithmetic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact and making an observation about the third-quarter rate compared to the second-quarter rate. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 626.
 If I can find the darn table--MR. PARTEE. Lyle's helping you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing frustration with finding the table, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict between speakers.


Passage number 627.
MR. BLACK. Here it is. It's on page 14 [of the Bluebook],Mr. Chairman. Under the short-term alternatives for Ml, "A" gives you10.8 percent for the third quarter; "B" gives you 10 percent; and "C"gives you 9.2 percent. That may be obfuscation to a certain degree,but it is probably a more meaningful number than the rates from Juneto September in a sense. I don't know whether it's a wise thing to do-56-7/12-13/83or not, but I don't think anybody could deny that that's probably amore meaningful figure than the behavior over a particular month inthe period. Any of those involves some deceleration but not what mostpeople would think of as a terribly fast deceleration. I don't knowwhat the fourth quarter looks like at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a statement of information and opinions by Mr. Black.


Passage number 628.
MR. ROBERTS. That would be 2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a statement.


Passage number 629.
MR. BLACK. That's going to be a lot less. You run into afew more problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black simply states that there will be fewer problems, implying that the situation will improve or become easier.


Passage number 630.
 You assume that's within your target and then youstart talking about the month-to-month--MR. AXILROD. Well, you have very low fourth-quarter numbers[if you] believe that. Growth is going to have decelerate into the 4or 5 percent area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a continuation of a conversation where one person is stating their assumption about a target and the other person is providing additional information about low fourth-quarter numbers and the expected growth rate. There is no clear disagreement or conflict between the two speakers.


Passage number 631.
MR. BLACK. You have faith on that, Steve. I know they wouldbe low, but I don't have those [numbers] in front of me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black acknowledges that he does not have the numbers in front of him, indicating he is not disputing or contradicting the statement made by Steve.


Passage number 632.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With that kind of increase in the thirdquarter, we'd have to have, say, 5 percent for the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement presents a hypothetical scenario using the modifier "say" to indicate an example or suggestion.


Passage number 633.
MR. BLACK. It is pretty low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement made by Mr. Black does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply states his opinion that something is "pretty low," without indicating any opposing viewpoint or argument.


Passage number 634.
MR. AXILROD. Yes. That's what comes out of the averagingprocess. If Ml growth is decelerating at the end of the third quarterand continuing to decelerate in the fourth quarter, you get very lownumbers. But I would be very cautious about [assuming] that willhappen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and cautioning against making assumptions.


Passage number 635.
MR. GUFFEY. That's a quarterly average.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states a statement made by Mr. Guffey, which presents a fact or a piece of information rather than expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 636.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, low numbers month-to-month and a lowquarterly average in the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states the fact that there were low numbers month-to-month and a low quarterly average in the fourth quarter.


Passage number 637.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And July looks as if it's going to behigh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of fact rather than a point of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 638.
MR. AXILROD. We will get the more recent numbers shortly.At the moment it looks that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they will receive updated information soon and currently, it appears to support the mentioned idea.


Passage number 639.
MR. GRAMLEY. That makes a very strong case, if we are goingto rebase at all, for rebasing on June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley is simply stating a point that rebasing on June would make a strong case.


Passage number 640.
MR. AXILROD. Last year, Mr. Chairman, we thought July wasgoing to be high and it came in weak. Remember, that was the surpriselast year. And August and September came in high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that there was a surprise last year when July came in weak instead of high, and August and September came in high. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 641.
MR. CORRIGAN. Another thing on this rebasing: If we don'trebase, we are going to have a target this year of 8 to 12 percent or7 to 11 percent or something like that and then what do we do nextyear. We're left having to hang out a target for next year that onthe surface is going to look like it's 4 or 5 percentage points belowour target for this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement or proposition that can be considered a point of contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the potential consequences of not rebasing and the challenges it may present in setting targets for the next year.


Passage number 642.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Maybe if we talk long enough, youwill come back to my suggestion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests the possibility of reaching a resolution through extended conversation.


Passage number 643.
-57-7/12-13/83MR. CORRIGAN. What, an easy money policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a mathematical calculation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 644.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The fact that we are doing somemodest tightening, [which is] probably what we're going to be doing, Idon't think we ought to show that. And there's enough justificationin the M2 and M3 figures to justify a modest tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker believes that it is unnecessary to show the modest tightening, while there are others who think that the M2 and M3 figures justify the modest tightening.


Passage number 645.
MR. WALLICH. We are pretty far into the expansion and it's avery strong expansion. Interest rates have gone up very moderately.Historically [speaking], I don't think it's a very tough policy thatwe've had.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that the current expansion is strong and that interest rates have only increased moderately. They express their belief that the policy pursued is not particularly tough.


Passage number 646.
MR. GRAMLEY. Hopefully, we're only about 1/8th of the way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their hopes about the progress made, indicating a positive outlook.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 647.
MR. RICE. Compared to what--what we've done in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker is questioning or comparing the current action to what has been done in the past, indicating potential disagreement or uncertainty.


Passage number 648.
MR. GRAMLEY. Maybe 1/16th.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply suggests that the answer to a question might be "1/16th."


Passage number 649.
MR. CORRIGAN. If we are not careful, it may not be aneighth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 650.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We don't have a typical recovery. Wehave a very strange world situation as you know, Henry. And yet Idon't see that that whole world situation enters into our bottom linepolicymaking here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the atypical nature of the recovery and expressing their opinion that the world situation does not impact their decision-making process.


Passage number 651.
MR. WALLICH. Whether that is a very major thing[unintelligible]. I wrenched myself away from that on the groundsthat we're contributing a good deal more to the world expansion byhaving this bigger growth rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their belief that having a bigger growth rate contributes more to world expansion.


Passage number 652.
MR. MARTIN. But the interest sensitive sectors of thedomestic recovery have not had time to react to or [feel] the impactof the slightly higher rate. A month from now, six weeks from now, wewill see the interest sensitive areas, especially housing, begin tolevel off or decline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the potential impact of slightly higher interest rates on interest-sensitive sectors such as housing.


Passage number 653.
MR. BLACK. That's another reason why Ml may well slow down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement made by Mr. Black and does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a simple statement of his perspective or opinion.


Passage number 654.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I would suggest that we go to theshort-term ranges. The more one looks at the problems in the nextquarter, it bears upon the reality of any number we put down for therest of this year. So, let us move to the short-term ranges. We cando that by dispensing with the Managers' reports at this point, toavoid any interruption in the continuity. What do we have now for theshort-run ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting that they focus on the short-term ranges and avoid the interruption of the Managers' reports. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 655.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, the table on page 13 of theBluebook summarizes the short-term ranges. Alternative A retains thefederal funds rate range of 6 to 10 percent, which was in the lastdirective of the Committee, but assumes in effect retaining the degreeof restraint on bank reserve positions that the Committee mostrecently has allowed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a statement of information regarding the summary table in the Bluebook and the assumptions of Alternative A.


Passage number 656.
 And those money market conditions, we believe,are consistent with a slowing in Ml growth to a 7-1/2 percent rangeover the June-to-September period, as you see, and a slowing of M2 andM3 growth---58-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That produces what quarterly average.It's 10 percent or something that like.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply presents a statement of belief or prediction regarding money market conditions and growth rates.


Passage number 657.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, that produces a 10.8 percent quarterlyaverage, given a high July. And I might add that I do now have veryrecent data and they would not suggest that July is very differentfrom 10 percent. They tend to confirm the first couple of weeks inJuly that we had estimated last week. Alternative B and alternative Ccontemplate a tightening of bank reserve positions--in the case ofalternative B, perhaps up to the 9-1/2 percent area for the funds rateand perhaps up to the $850 million to $1 billion range for member bankborrowing. And alternative C contemplates even more tightening. Webelieve alternative B is generally consistent with Ml growth,expressing it at an annual rate, in the 7 to 11 percent range and ismore consistent than alternative A with the broader aggregates--atleast M2--being closer to the midpoint of their ranges. We believealternative A to be more consistent with the broader aggregates beingtoward the upper end of their ranges--particularly M3, but M2 would bein the upper half of its range. And for M1 we would be morecomfortable, I think, with an 8 to 12 percent range for the year. Thegreater tightness of alternative C we believe would be more temporaryeven than that under alternative B because we would contemplate a morerapid downward reaction of the demands for goods and services. Andthat would tend to be reversed toward the end of the year and intoearly next year more than with alternative B and, of course, thatwould contemplate a greater slowing of M2 and M3.Mr. Chairman, in view of the uncertainties, I might say thatas a policy course it would not seem illogical to me to contemplatehigher growth rates of the aggregates, such as those in alternative A,even if the Committee wanted also to contemplate some littletightening of the money market. If the Committee did not wish tocontemplate any tightening, it certainly seems as if the higher growthrates of alternative A, or maybe even higher rates, would be necessaryso far as we can see at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different alternatives and discussing their potential effects on various aggregates. There is no indication of disagreement or debate among the speaker and others.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 658.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not quite sure I understand what youjust said. You say when you really look at it, you're not surealternative A is inconsistent with some modest tightening of the moneymarket.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "I'm not quite sure I understand what you just said" implies a lack of agreement or clarity in the conversation. Additionally, the phrase "you're not sure alternative A is inconsistent with some modest tightening of the money market" suggests a difference in opinions or perspectives regarding the potential inconsistency.


Passage number 659.
MR. AXILROD. If the Committee wanted to contemplate no morethan a modest tightening, then I think it would be more certain to getthat result to be consistent with the [growth rates it adopts for the]aggregates if it raises them. If the Committee were willing to havemuch more than a modest tightening--quite a tightening--then, ofcourse, a lower aggregate [figure] would work more to assure that thatwould develop naturally.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Axilrod is presenting different scenarios and explaining how different aggregate figures would affect the desired outcome.


Passage number 660.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Are you talking about roughly a $600million borrowing assumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is simply a question asking for clarification about the borrowing assumption.


Passage number 661.
MR. AXILROD. Well, I'm not sure that that would get you alot of tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Axilrod expresses uncertainty and suggests that a particular action may not yield significant results, but there is no clear disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 662.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think we need $800 million to getthe funds rate to 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating their own opinion or belief about the amount of money needed to achieve a specific goal.


Passage number 663.
-59-7/12-13/83MR. AXILROD. Probably, although this week borrowing isrunning around $400 million. Of course, in earlier weeks it had runmuch, much higher very steadily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is providing information about borrowing trends without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 664.
MR. MARTIN. When you associate "A" with some tightening, areyou referring to a validation by us of the movement in the marketsthat has already occurred or are you talking about higher rates fromtoday's level or yesterday's level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply asks for clarification on the meaning of a statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 665.
MR. AXILROD. I was associating alternative B with sometightening, Governor Martin--perhaps I misspoke--and alternative Awith about the present degree of reserve restraint, which would be avalidation [of the modest recent tightening].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is indicated by the phrase "perhaps I misspoke" which suggests that there was a misunderstanding or confusion about the association between alternative B and the degree of reserve restraint.


Passage number 666.
MR. MARTIN. Let me shift to "B" then: Are you talking aboutvalidation or further increases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 667.
MR. AXILROD. No, I was assuming further tightening wouldmean a funds rate moving up at least to 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Axilrod is simply making an assumption about the funds rate moving up to 9-1/2 percent.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 668.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you're talking about the funds rate.That might be consistent with the rest of the market being where itis, if [market participants] thought that was the end of [thetightening]. But they may not think it's the end of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The passage presents two contrasting viewpoints. The first sentence suggests agreement or consistency between the funds rate and the rest of the market, while the second sentence implies disagreement or doubt about the end of tightening.


Passage number 669.
MR. MARTIN. I wouldn't think it's the end of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is only one speaker in this passage, Mr. Martin, and he is expressing his own opinion or belief. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 670.
MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask Steve, inresponse to Tony's question: If we select alternative A, what kind ofborrowing level in your judgment would give us a funds rate someplacebetween 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Guffey is simply asking Steve for his professional judgment on the borrowing level that would result in a specific funds rate.


Passage number 671.
MR. AXILROD. That is somewhat tighter than we contemplatedin alternative A and I would say between $600 and $850 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Axilrod is simply providing information about the estimated amount.


Passage number 672.
MR. GUFFEY. Between $600 and $700 million would you say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It simply asks for an estimation of the amount between $600 and $700 million.


Passage number 673.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without further context, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 674.
 Borrowing has fluctuated so much that--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can't interpret the borrowing levelwithout some allowance for excess reserves. We've had borrowing muchhigher but we have had a lot of excess reserves. I think the changein free reserves or net borrowed reserves is roughly what wecontemplated, but we have been getting a lot of borrowing in thebeginning of the week and the market gets easy.SPEAKER(.). Because banks have so many excess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and analysis about borrowing and excess reserves.


Passage number 675.
MR. GRAMLEY. Would it be better, instead of an initialborrowing assumption, to talk about an initial net borrowed reservenumber.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 676.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In some sense it is probably better totalk in those terms or in some combination of the two. I think of theborrowing number as shorthand for something that's associated with$350 million or so of excess reserves, which used to be normal. Forseveral months, at least, it has been well above that. I think thedistribution of reserves results in some easing influence even though-60-7/12-13/83the borrowing is high. So, implicitly I look at the net borrowedreserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. The author says "I think the distribution of reserves results in some easing influence even though the borrowing is high," implying that there may be disagreement or differing opinions on whether the high borrowing is a negative or positive factor.


Passage number 677.
MR. PARTEE. Alternative A on Ml would be consistent withwhat for the last two quarters [of 1983].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there does not appear to be contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact or providing information without expressing any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 678.
MR. AXILROD. We thought that would be more consistent--againthis is judgmental--with the alternative that isn't here; we had morelike an 8 to 12 percent range for the year. Alternative B, which isthe basis of the staff forecast, we thought was more consistent with a7 to 11 percent range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their thoughts and judgments about two different alternatives.


Passage number 679.
MS. TEETERS. And "B" implies a rise in rates to 9-3/4percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states that "B" implies a rise in rates to 9-3/4 percent.


Passage number 680.
MR. AXILROD. The way we had written "B," it assumed a fundsrate probably up in the 9-1/2 percent area or somewhat higher. Again,it depends on what borrowing level the Committee adopts. The onePresident Guffey suggested would be somewhat lower. What we have inhere is 9-1/2 to 10 percent; where it would fall in that range dependsa bit on how it's toned up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply exploring different possibilities and discussing the potential impact of different borrowing levels. There is no clear contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 681.
MS. TEETERS. Net free reserves, excluding the one week inthe past six when it was positive, would average about $225 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about net free reserves without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 682.
MR. PARTEE. Net borrowed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states the information without any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 683.
MS. TEETERS. Yes, net borrowed reserves were about $225million. And I agree with the Chairman that that's what we shouldfocus on--whether we want to increase the net borrowed [assumption] orkeep it the same--because the week-to-week changes in the excess andborrowings are really all we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the Chairman's statement and expresses their own agreement with focusing on the net borrowed reserves.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 684.
MR. MEEK. I think that $225 million includes about $150million of seasonal borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Meek, believes that $225 million includes $150 million of seasonal borrowing. This statement may be met with disagreement as it is an opinion or belief that others may hold a different perspective on.


Passage number 685.
MS. TEETERS. I thought that was out of there. It's theextended that you pushed over.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough context to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 686.
MR. MEEK. Seasonal borrowing is in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that seasonal borrowing is in.


Passage number 687.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 688.
 But if we're going to work with theinitial assumption of net borrowed reserves, then we have to make anestimate as to what the excess reserves are going to be, and I don'tthink--MS. TEETERS. They are not unrelated, Tony.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a continuation of a thought and does not present conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 689.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I know that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: it will rain tomorrow because the weather forecast predicts a 90% chance of precipitation.


Passage number 690.
MS. TEETERS. When the borrowing goes sky high so do theexcess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not show any disagreement or contention. It simply states a relationship between borrowing and excess reserves.


Passage number 691.
MR. AXILROD. No, that would eliminate the need to make thatassumption in advance. If you gave us a net borrowed assumption, wewould have a required reserve figure; under lagged reserve accountingthat would disappear later and then we would know the nonborrowedreserve number by subtraction. Whatever excess is involved and-61-7/12-13/83however net borrowed chooses to distribute itself between excess andborrowings, we'll work out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 692.
 We will have a lot of borrowing and a lotof excess, or a little borrowing and a little excess, for the same--MR. WALLICH. Well, you remember the old mechanism: If youkeep net borrowed at a given level that the banks don't findconsistent with prevailing interest rates, the money supply will getaway from you as you try to maintain that net borrowed level. It's avery tricky, slippery target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is a disagreement or contention regarding the appropriate level of borrowing and excess in relation to prevailing interest rates. While one person is advocating for a lot of borrowing and excess, another person is warning about the potential difficulties in maintaining a consistent net borrowed level.


Passage number 693.
MR. GRAMLEY. No trickier than [the relationship of] initialborrowing to the federal funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply describes the relationship between initial borrowing and the federal funds rate, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 694.
MR. PARTEE. Yes. I think we've been doing exactly the samething here in the last 6 to 9 months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that the speaker agrees with something that has been happening in the last 6 to 9 months. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 695.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, what bothers me more than anythingelse is that when we stopped tracking Ml we lost a lot of thatautomatic correcting mechanism we had before. I don't think thefigures we choose here are as important as that we agree that we aregoing to change the borrowing level and federal funds rate--and maybein rather prompt steps--if the actual growth deviates from what weexpect. That's the point I'd like to see us zero in on if we could,because all we can do now on the present procedures are ad hocadjustments. That makes me a little uncomfortable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows a disagreement or contention. Mr. Black is expressing his concerns and discomfort with the current procedures of making ad hoc adjustments instead of having a mechanism for automatic correction.


Passage number 696.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I should have commented that theproposed directive alternative on the short run does include abracketed proposal that the Committee may want to consider asconsistent with this discussion. If it were included, it would implya degree of automaticity in reaction that has not been attained forsome time; if not included, we could not have the automaticity thathad been in place before last October. That's another point theCommittee may wish to consider.SPEAKER(.). Where are you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are simply offering different options for the Committee to consider.


Passage number 697.
MR. GRAMLEY. Pages 21 to 22. That would go with thebracketed comment on page 21.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply referring to which page number the mentioned bracketed comment can be found.


Passage number 698.
MR. AXILROD. I had not thought that those necessarilyfollowed, Governor Gramley. This would be in case the Committeewished to give a little more weight to Ml and a little moreautomaticity, whether or not the bracketed part under the long run--.Oh, I'm sorry. You mean the second paragraph on page 21. That'sright; it would go more logically with the last paragraph.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a clarification or confirmation of what was previously said, rather than a disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 699.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think we ought to have some modestdegree of tightening here, but it's a matter of degree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Well, I think we ought to have some modest degree of tightening here" implies that the speaker believes in the need for some level of tightening. However, the phrase "but it's a matter of degree" suggests that there is a difference in opinion regarding the extent or level of tightening.


Passage number 700.
MR. ROBERTS. Alternative B accommodates the present rate ofgrowth in M1 during the third quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact or observation that "Alternative B accommodates the present rate of growth in M1 during the third quarter."


Passage number 701.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Present rate of growth. I'm not quitesure what you mean by the present rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification about the meaning of "present rate" as it is not clear to them.


Passage number 702.
 It would accommodate---62-7/12-13/83MR. ROBERTS. The 10 percent rate we've been seeing in Ml inthe third quarter would be reflected under alternative B. It'srunning about 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact about the rate of Ml in the third quarter without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 703.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I thought it was running above that. Oh,you mean from June. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The conversation flows smoothly as one person initially expresses their thoughts, and the other person clarifies what they mean.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 704.
MR. ROBERTS. [July] is estimated, I thought he said, atabout the same as [June].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Roberts, seems to question or challenge the estimation made by someone else, as indicated by the phrase "I thought he said." This suggests that there might be a disagreement or lack of agreement in the information being discussed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 705.
MR. AXILROD. That's right. But if you adopt the 6 percentand July is correct, that alternative would necessarily imply a sharpdrop in August and September to about 4 percent. That would give youa high quarterly average but August and September would have to comedown quite a lot to get there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions adopting a 6 percent rate for July, but then discusses the possibility of a sharp drop in August and September to about 4 percent. This implies a disagreement or contention about the projected rates for those months.


Passage number 706.
MR. MARTIN. And you're talking about [growth in] totalreserves under "B" at 2-1/4 percent June-to-September.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 707.
MR. AXILROD. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage does not provide any specific information about a disagreement or contention. It only shows that Mr. Axilrod is responding or agreeing with something that was not mentioned in the given passage. Therefore, the answer is "No."


Passage number 708.
MR. MARTIN. It's also substantial.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "It's also substantial" is a simple observation or statement of agreement, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas expressed.


Passage number 709.
MR. AXILROD. It was because of that sharp drop implied inAugust and September that I suggested with a bit of caution thepossibility of higher growth rates [even] if you had some modesttightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 710.
MR. MARTIN. What would "B" imply with regard to the primerate--very considerable pressure upward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question and there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 711.
MR. AXILROD. I would think a rise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply expressing a personal opinion or expectation of Mr. Axilrod.


Passage number 712.
MS. TEETERS. There'd be even more pressure on the mortgagerate. Last week it was at 13.3 percent, when we had a--and I quote--"modest increase" in pressure. Apply the same modest increase inpressure and it would get over 14 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating a fact about the mortgage rate.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 713.
MR. AXILROD. But "B" is going to a funds rate of 9-1/2 to 10percent. If the Committee were only going to a 9-1/2 percent fundsrate, things would become a little more iffy; it becomes a sort ofstruggle between the banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage because Mr. Axilrod is suggesting that if the funds rate were lowered to 9-1/2 percent instead of 9-1/2 to 10 percent, it would create a struggle or conflict between the banks.


Passage number 714.
MS. TEETERS. But, Steve, didn't you say even alternative Aimplies some increase in restraint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Teeters is simply seeking clarification from Steve regarding his previous statement. Her question does not indicate disagreement, but rather a request for further information.


Passage number 715.
MR. AXILROD. Well, we were writing alternative A as if itimplied bank reserve positions that would keep the money market aboutwhere it is. It's probable that short-term rates and long-term rateshave anticipated a further tightening, so there is some realpossibility of a little drop in rates under alternative A if it worksout that the money market just doesn't tighten up from its recentdegree of restraint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing a potential outcome under alternative A.


Passage number 716.
MR. RICE. Alternative A does include the present degree ofrestraint--that is, it includes the tightening that has already takenplace.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 717.
-63-7/12-13/83MR. AXILROD. That's what we were intending. The market isanticipating further tightening, as far as we could construe up toyesterday. But, that's what we were intending.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply relaying information about the market anticipating further tightening.


Passage number 718.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think it's fair to say that themarket, particularly after the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, probablywill not retreat and will tend to assume that this is not the lastupward adjustment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states an opinion about the market and predicts its future behavior.


Passage number 719.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the problem. When we get into aphase of change they keep anticipating more and more until somethinghappens to change that, such as a decline in the money supply, aweakness in the economy, or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is stating a problem and listing potential factors that could change the situation, without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 720.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. They are reacting now to those wideswings in weekly Ml variations as they were before we had formallydeemphasized Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is stating a fact about a reaction to variations in weekly Ml.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 721.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You put more on M1 than I think isjustified.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The speaker expresses disagreement with the amount placed on M1 by using the phrase "more than I think is justified." This suggests that there is contention or disagreement regarding the allocation of resources to M1.


Passage number 722.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm talking about the swings [in Ml]we're now seeing in the Friday publications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about swings in a Friday publication.


Passage number 723.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, what I had in mind was borrowing ofroughly $600 to $800 million, but I assumed excess reserves of $300 to$400 million, say. It implies higher borrowings as it evens out ifexcess reserves are very high. Whether that's consistent with "A" or"B," I don't know; I guess it's someplace in between.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their idea of borrowing a certain amount of money and assuming a range of excess reserves. They also admit uncertainty about whether their idea aligns with options "A" or "B."


Passage number 724.
MR. MEEK. Let me mention one other factor that's in thatborrowing number. We have a lot of nonmember banks that now haveaccess to the discount window; they're borrowing about $100 million.The seasonal borrowing is $150 million and there has always been anormal frictional borrowing amount of about $100 million. So, you'retalking about a $350 million base in some sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is presenting information about different categories of borrowing, but there is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 725.
MR. BLACK. Also, borrowing has been so low that there's lessreluctance [by banks] to come in, so it's probably going to be high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is providing information regarding borrowing being low and banks being less reluctant to come in, with the expectation that it will lead to high borrowing.


Passage number 726.
MR. MEEK.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 727.
 I think $600 million is probably about where weare now, but not in--MR. PARTEE. $600 million on borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply presents a perspective or opinion about the amount of borrowing, without any conflicting statements or arguments.


Passage number 728.
MR. MEEK. I think $600 million on borrowing is somewherearound 9 percent or a little higher--perhaps 9-1/8 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "I think $600 million on borrowing is somewhere around 9 percent or a little higher--perhaps 9-1/8 percent" is a personal opinion or estimation given by Mr. Meek.


Passage number 729.
MR. BOEHNE. So, what we need is $800 million to get to 9-1/2percent. Is that what you are saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Boehne is simply asking for confirmation or clarification about the amount needed.


Passage number 730.
MR. MEEK. Well, I would give a little range there, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Meek is expressing his own opinion or suggestion without challenging or contradicting anyone else's statements.


Passage number 731.
MS. TEETERS. Why do you feel we need to tighten now over andabove what we've already done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 732.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The economy is moving pretty fast; we havesome inflationary danger sitting out there in the future; and the-64-7/12-13/83aggregates are running high. So, I'd go for a modest tightening untilI see a change in this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a statement about the current state of the economy and the author's suggested course of action.


Passage number 733.
MS. TEETERS. What's wrong with the economy recovering.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 734.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Nothing, if it does it in a sustained way--a noninflationary way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a fact without any opposing views or conflicting perspectives.


Passage number 735.
MR. RICE. The forecast doesn't show very much inflationarydanger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that the forecast doesn't show much inflationary danger. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 736.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The staff forecast doesn't show muchinflationary danger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the staff forecast does not indicate a significant risk of inflation. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 737.
MR. RICE. No, the consensus forecast; I didn't hear anystrong arguments against the staff forecast on that score.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that there is no contention or disagreement in the consensus forecast.


Passage number 738.
MR. WALLICH. If we don't act somewhat now, I think we'rerepeating what we've done many times before. That is, we let it runtoo long and we then confront either inflation or excessive interestrate increases. Both put an end to the expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's belief that if action is not taken soon, it may lead to inflation or excessive interest rate increases, which will end the expansion.


Passage number 739.
MR. PARTEE. We've just had a concerted move in the market,which is the point that Pres made. Now, maybe we haven't fullyconfirmed that move. But I would be happy to see the private ratestructure stay where it is for a while because I think it will havesome effect on the very credit sensitive industries and we ought towait and see what that is before we let this get away from us on thetightening side. But I think that's probably consistent with a littletightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is expressing his opinion and stating that he would be happy to see the private rate structure stay where it is for a while. He also suggests waiting and observing the effects on credit-sensitive industries before considering tightening further. This is not a contradictory or conflicting statement, but rather a consistent viewpoint.


Passage number 740.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's what I would [unintelligible]except for this expectation. We've had rates move up, and I'm notsure the market is convinced that we've moved at all. Now, when wetell them that we have--probably tomorrow--we will get anotherreaction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and perception of the market movement, without contradicting or arguing with anyone else.


Passage number 741.
MR. RICE. I don't understand how that tightening isconsistent with steady [reserve] positions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Rice is expressing confusion and seeking clarification regarding the relationship between tightening and consistent reserve positions.


Passage number 742.
MR. MORRIS. There's no doubt that we've moved in the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Morris states a statement without any conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 743.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know. What do you think. I justread the newspaper. Some say we've moved a tiny bit and some say wehaven't.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, there is disagreement between different opinions or perspectives. Some people say that there has been a small movement, while others argue that there hasn't been any movement at all.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 744.
MR. MEEK. Well, I think the analysts have one [view] and thetraders another. I think the traders have voted with their feet andhave anticipated not only 9-1/8 percent but something on the order of9-1/2 percent. The analysts are still sorting out free reserves,borrowings, and excess reserves, and lag a bit behind.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker mentions that the analysts and traders have different views. The traders anticipate a higher percentage than the analysts, indicating a disagreement.


Passage number 745.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If we tighten to 9-1/2 percent, thechances of the market not continuing to anticipate that there might bemore tightening later on are very small. I don't think we couldtighten without getting some movement in the whole spectrum of short-term rates, even though technically the 9-1/2 percent [funds rate]would be consistent with the short-term rates we've seen here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating a prediction or likelihood that tightening the rate to 9-1/2 percent would result in movement in the whole spectrum of short-term rates.


Passage number 746.
-65-7/12-13/83MR. MORRIS. It would force a change in the prime rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This statement is a factual statement that suggests there would be a change in the prime rate if a certain condition were to occur. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 747.
MR. PARTEE. Well, the prime rate probably ought to go up anotch.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Partee expressing his opinion that the prime rate should be increased slightly.


Passage number 748.
MS. TEETERS. You're going to force a change in the discountrate, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement regarding the change in the discount rate. It only mentions that a change will occur.


Passage number 749.
MR. CORRIGAN. No, I don't think that follows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Corrigan simply expresses his opinion and states that he doesn't believe something follows.


Passage number 750.
MR. MORRIS. I think we could very easily see the prime ratego to 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It is simply stating Mr. Morris's opinion.


Passage number 751.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, and it probably ought to. Everything elsehas moved and the prime has not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states that something should be done and explains that everything else has already moved except for the prime (presumably referring to a prime number).


Passage number 752.
MR. ROBERTS. Everything has moved 5/8 to 3/4 point exceptthe prime.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 753.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The logic of that argument, Chuck,that we [ought] to wait a while before we put more pressure on thewhole spectrum of short-term interest rates is that we really can'tafford to push up the fed funds rate even though it would be in atechnically better relationship.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker presents an argument for waiting before putting more pressure on short-term interest rates, while acknowledging that it would be technically better to push up the fed funds rate.


Passage number 754.
MR. PARTEE. That could be. An awful lot will be determinedby [events in] the next few days--the testimony and so forth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Partee, suggesting that the outcome of future events, such as testimony, will have a significant impact.


Passage number 755.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I am assuming that the tone of thattestimony, to the extent that it's not as completely neutral as it canbe, is that it would give more [emphasis] to the question of alertnessto the strength of the economy, strength of the aggregates, etc., thanit would to any implication that would correct anticipation on theother side. In other words, I don't see any reason to assume that thetestimony would tend to take the upward movement and expectations out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating the assumption about the tone of the testimony, without implying any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 756.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is only one way to do that. If wein fact move a little, then we say we moved a little and leave theimplication that at this point we don't see any reason to move anymore.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that there is only one way to do something, and then goes on to explain that if we move a little, we acknowledge that movement but imply that we don't see a need to move further at this point. There is no disagreement or contention expressed in this passage.


Passage number 757.
MS. TEETERS. We've already moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that they have already moved.


Passage number 758.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All right, we have moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that "we have moved." It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 759.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Are you prepared to go that far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if the listener is ready or willing to do something.


Passage number 760.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that depends upon what we do here, Iguess. I don't see how we can give that impression without moving abit here. If we move a little here, we can leave the impression thatwe may have a little tightening but there's nothing else in the offingother than what we're in the process of doing immediately. Thatprobably won't calm them down. I don't think [the market] is going tobe calmed down until something happens like the money supply goingdown or the economy showing a bad month or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of one person's perspective on potentially calming the market.


Passage number 761.
MR. ROBERTS. And we had the first month of a turnaround inbusiness loan demand in June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states a fact that there was a turnaround in business loan demand in June. It does not imply any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 762.
-66-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The fact is that in a strong economy andanything like their present mood there's no reason why we shouldindicate a decline in interest rates, whatever we do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the relationship between a strong economy, a particular mood, and indications of declining interest rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 763.
MR. MARTIN. But that's one month of business borrowing andthe kind of businesses that provide much of the new employment arepaying 2 to 3 points over prime. If we get the prime rate up another50 or 75 [basis] points and add 2 to 3 [percentage points] on top ofthat, we'll see how much borrowing we get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is expressing concern over the potentially negative impact of increasing the prime rate and adding additional percentage points on borrowing for businesses. This suggests that he disagrees with the idea or sees it as problematic.


Passage number 764.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, some people are still paying prime, butit's less of a significant rate in the C&I market. In New York,three-fourths of the new loans are not at prime; in Chicago, half ofthem are not at prime.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides statements of fact without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 765.
MR. PARTEE. They're below prime.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a straightforward observation.


Passage number 766.
MR. MARTIN. Yes, but small businesses are paying 200 to 300basis points over prime, as we all know. In construction with 100basis point increase on FHA/VA [loans], they're back to paying 6points again. The conventional loan points are much more, maybe 10.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the interest rates and loan points associated with small businesses and construction projects. They are stating facts and observations without expressing any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 767.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states who Vice Chairman Solomon is without any conflicting information or opposing views.


Passage number 768.
 There has been a bit of a shift backto prime as the Eurodollar and the Libor rate got lower and the banksfound some of their interest is--MR. PARTEE. Well, I think Pres is right that very few peoplein the construction industry pay prime. They'll be paying prime plus2 probably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 769.
MR. MARTIN. And then points on the mortgage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact about points on the mortgage.


Passage number 770.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What I'd like to get to, which is a littledifficult to do in the current atmosphere, is the point where we'renot really tightening more than we can tighten--where the expectationsin the market change and they say that whatever change in interestrates will be might have [occurred] and that the next move might bedown again. We're not there; we are a long ways from there in thepresent atmosphere because of all the external events and the moneysupply. How do we get there without making things so tight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing a desire to reach a certain point but acknowledges that it is difficult to do so currently due to external events and the money supply. There is no indication of conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 771.
Obviously, we don't want to--MR. GRAMLEY. Well, it's going to take a while to get there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their understanding and agreement with the statement that "it's going to take a while to get there."


Passage number 772.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage since it only mentions the name "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" without providing any context or information that would indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 773.
 I don't think we can do it right at themoment, but I--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think you can do it in yourtestimony either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and acknowledging that the other person may also face a similar challenge.


Passage number 774.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 775.
MR. GRAMLEY. We're not going to get there until there hasbeen enough evidence in the financial data and the nonfinancial datato indicate to the public that no further tightening is needed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, is stating a conditional statement that until sufficient evidence in financial and nonfinancial data is available to indicate that no further tightening is required, the goal of reaching a certain state will not be achieved. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument being presented in this statement.


Passage number 776.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that is right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 777.
-67-7/12-13/83MR. PARTEE. A smaller quarter in GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply a numerical calculation or statement.


Passage number 778.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Basically I agree with what you're saying.What we're doing here is trying to maneuver things so that indeedthose things happen in two or three months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explicitly states that they agree with what the other person is saying and that they are working together towards a common goal.


Passage number 779.
MR. GRAMLEY. That's why I would agree that some slightfurther nudging up is needed. I do think it's important to recognizethat we have accomplished a good bit. We have long-term rates up 3/4percentage point, the stock market has stopped booming, and theexchange rate hasn't dropped a ton like we thought it was going to doin the past year, so we got restraint from that side too. So, we'vemade some progress. I think we probably need a little more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees that further action is needed, but also acknowledges the progress that has been made so far.


Passage number 780.
MR. BLACK. And Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 781.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do you consider the exchange rateprogress.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "exchange rate progress" is not explicitly being disputed or contradicted.


Passage number 782.
MR. GRAMLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Based on the provided information, it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage only mentions "Mr. Gramley" without any further context or information.


Passage number 783.
 Well, progress in achieving a--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Would you like to quantify your view.We'll start backwards: start with that view and then translate itinto the right numbers and then go back to the long term. How do youquantify your view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking for the listener's view and how they quantify or measure it in order to further the understanding of a specific topic or idea.


Passage number 784.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I would go for a borrowing figure ofsomewhere around $800 million probably, or $850 million. I'd like tosee the federal funds rate hit around 9-1/2 percent. I wouldn't wantit to go up high into the 9-1/2 to 10 percent range. I would gobasically with the specs of "B." That's where I'd be. I want to dothis cautiously. I would not wish to go in the direction that thebracketed language in the directive suggests, with a lot ofautomaticity in response. I think automaticity in response ought tobe avoided like the plague because we just don't know what these moneynumbers mean. Until those numbers begin to make more sense, I thinkwe ought to use a judgmental approach rather than an automaticresponse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Gramley is expressing his own opinion and preferences, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict with others.


Passage number 785.
MR. PARTEE. Well, those specs aren't bad. I'd be close [tothat]. I'm not sure I agree with the last point, although I certainlylean away from automaticity. But I feel that we would need to rebaseMl in order to show the market that we're not going to be trying toget it down in the range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement between the speaker and anyone else. Mr. Partee is simply expressing his thoughts and opinions about the topic.


Passage number 786.
MR. GRAMLEY. I agree with that too; for the long-run range Iwould use 4 to 8 percent based on June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage states that Mr. Gramley agrees with a certain statement without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 787.
MR. WALLICH. I could go with alternative B shaded a littleon the low side--not as far as $1 billion of borrowed reserves or 10percent on the funds rate. I'd use lower limits--$850 million and 9-3/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their preference for alternative B, but suggesting a slightly lower limit than initially presented.


Passage number 788.
MS. TEETERS. Are you going to show the 7 to 11 percent range[for fed funds]. That is going to come out as a very strong signal:that we're raising rates by a whole percentage point and the range byquite a bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 789.
-68-7/12-13/83MR. WALLICH. Well, we're supposedly now in the 6 to 10percent range and funds are at 9-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply provides information about the current range of percentages and the interest rate of funds.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 790.
MS. TEETERS. Well, I just find it very difficult to acceptany tightening. I didn't approve a tightening last time and I justdon't think we need any more at this point. We haven't had time, ashas been pointed out, to get the effect on the mortgage market and theautomobile industry of what we have done already. And the economy,which has had only two quarters of recovery, doesn't strike me as onethat needs a lot of restraint. And it's also one which is fairlytypical. We typically get a quarter like this. We should get somerecovery before we start tightening again; we should let it get backto something close to normal. I'd go for alternative A and keep thefree reserves minus the special factors like the seasonal in a rangeof maybe $200 to $250 million dollars net borrowed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Ms. Teeters, disagrees with the idea of tightening and argues that there is no need for further tightening at this point.


Passage number 791.
MR. RICE. I would support that. I think we've already had agood deal of tightening. I know some people think it's minuscule; Ithink it's significant at this point in the recovery. I would not atthis time want to damp the recovery because I'm not yet sure it is allthat strong. It may well be as strong as many of you think it is, butI would like to be surer than I am now and I would want to wait a bitbefore I tighten any further. I'd want to wait at least another monthor two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Rice, agrees with the idea of supporting further tightening, but expresses caution and a desire to wait before taking any further action.


Passage number 792.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I'm closer to Emmett andNancy's view, but I think it would be perfectly reasonable tocompromise at something in the neighborhood of an initial borrowingassumption of, say, $700 million. I don't see that expectations aregoing to change, and that [borrowing] would we give us some modestfurther lift in rates and I think would be consistent, as Stevepointed out--at least I think he expressed this view--with the targetsof alternative A. I don't think the funds range is significant; theway we're running monetary policy these days, we're not going to toucheither extreme anyway. So, I don't think it's important whether weleave it at 6 to 10 percent or not. I think we might as well leaveit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their personal view and suggests a compromise, but they do not engage in any arguments or disagreements with others.


Passage number 793.
MR. GUFFEY. I would join that view for a borrowing level of$700 million or thereabouts. That suggests to me that we validatewhat has happened in the past; a funds rate roughly in the 9-1/8 to9-1/4 percent range with a potential high of 9-1/2 percent might fallout of the $700 million borrowing level. I would oppose going muchhigher than the $700 million at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement expresses the speaker's personal view and does not indicate any contention or disagreement with others.


Passage number 794.
MR. KEEHN. I'd be more inclined toward alternative B. I'dfeel more comfortable with a fed funds rate of 9-1/2 percent or maybea touch higher. And if a $750 to $800 million borrowing level wouldaccomplish that, I think that's where I'd be comfortable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses their preference for alternative B and states their comfort level with a borrowing level of $750 to $800 million.


Passage number 795.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You and I ought to change Districts.The theory of this regional system is that we reflect the view of ourDistricts. We do not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that both parties change districts in order to better reflect the views of their respective districts.


Passage number 796.
MR. ROBERTS. I think Si's view is about where I would be.Alternative B is closer to what I would like to see: a funds rate of9-1/2 to 10 percent and the borrowing somewhere around $800 million ifexcess reserves are going to be around $400 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Roberts, acknowledges that Si's view is similar to his own and expresses agreement with Alternative B.


Passage number 797.
-69-7/12-13/83MR. MORRIS. I would support the status quo policy ofalternative A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker, Mr. Morris, supports the status quo policy of alternative A.


Passage number 798.
MR. BOYKIN. I would support "B," pretty much for the reasonsthat have already been set forth. I won't bother to repeat them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states their agreement with option "B" and mentions that the reasons have already been stated previously, therefore they see no need to reiterate them.


Passage number 799.
MR. FORRESTAL. We would support alternative B, Mr.Chairman.We would look for something perhaps at the lower end of-that range forthe reasons you've already expressed--namely, that we're looking at amuch more robust recovery than we had anticipated and monetary growthis very strong. The major question facing the Committee, it seems tome, is how long we can allow the monetary aggregates to continue togrow without raising inflationary expectations. So, it's a questionof how much restraint needs to be put into the system. Our view wouldbe that a little more tightening is required at this time, and thealternative B specifications would fit that. I would say we wouldlook for borrowing at around the $800 million level, with the fundsrate somewhere between 9-1/2 and 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Forrestal, is expressing support for alternative B and explaining the reasons behind his position.


Passage number 800.
MR. BOEHNE. My preference is alternative A, for the reasonsstated. However, I would find acceptable an "A minus," which would be$700 million on borrowing and 9-1/4 percent on the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Boehne is expressing his preference and offering an alternative that he finds acceptable.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 801.
MR. MARTIN. I would support the Chairman's $600 to $800million range, anticipating that $700 million would be the midpoint ofthat. I would like to see fed funds at no higher than 9-1/2 percent.In other words, I'd support some verification on the interest rateside of what has already occurred, for the reasons I have mentionedtoo many times at this meeting. And I would move for the deletion ofthe automaticity embodied in the language in the two paragraphs thathave been called to our attention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Martin disagrees with the language in the two paragraphs that have been called to their attention and moves for their deletion. This suggests a disagreement or contention between Mr. Martin and whoever brought attention to those paragraphs.


Passage number 802.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else has something to say. Are wesupposed to be having coffee. If nobody else has anything to say, whydon't we have coffee quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking if anyone else has something to say and suggesting having coffee if no one does.


Passage number 803.
[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me try to summarize this as nearly asI see it. I am impressed, first of all, by the fact that ourforecasts, I assure you, will receive much more prominence [thanusual] in testimony and congressional discussion. I got a requestfrom Mr. St Germain that the first page of the Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony be nothing but a table of economic forecasts so they canconcentrate on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is simply stating their impression and the fact that their forecasts will receive more prominence in testimony and congressional discussion. They also mention a request they received from Mr. St Germain.


Passage number 804.
 I don't know whether I'll do that or not, but--MR. PARTEE. Our forecasts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or indications of disagreement or contention. It simply presents uncertainty about a future decision without expressing any conflicting opinions.


Passage number 805.
MS. TEETERS. Identified.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that someone named Ms. Teeters was identified.


Passage number 806.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The Committee forecast. So, it's going tobe sitting right out there on the front page. I calculated that thecentral tendency averages roughly 9-3/4 percent. They go up as highas 11-1/4 percent and the lowest is 8.9 to 9 percent, which rounds offto 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply presenting the forecast of the Committee without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 807.
MS. TEETERS. You're talking 4th quarter over 4th quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that someone is talking about the fourth quarter over the fourth quarter.


Passage number 808.
-70-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm talking 4th quarter over 4th quarterfor 1984. Now, wait a minute. No, there is someone who is as low as7 percent. Yes, the low is 7 percent. But still, I think this wouldbe 9-1/2 to 9-3/4 percent, just to cite that as background.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply includes some numerical calculations and the speaker's personal opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 809.
 But itbothers me in rationalizing--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. How is that lower one split betweenreal GNP and prices.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker is bothered by something related to rationalizing and is questioning the split between real GNP and prices.


Passage number 810.
MS. TEETERS. About even.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "about even" suggests that there is an equal balance or lack of any disagreement.


Passage number 811.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know how to answer thatbecause the way I have it arrayed it goes from high to low on each ofthese, so it doesn't add up. They are all higher than the staff. Orrather, the tendency is to be higher than the staff on the GNPdeflator. There's no question about that; that's where the differencefrom the staff forecast is. The staff forecast is 8.3 percent [onGNP] and on the deflator it's 4.1 percent. The central tendency onthe deflator is going to be 5 percent or something like that on theCommittee side. Now, it can be changed. But it will be sitting thereand much more than before we're going to be asked: Is this desirable.Is this what we really want. Is it consistent with our policy. Andso forth and so on. Let me just cite that as background.For the short run, after listening to you and considering thedesirability from my particular point of view of a little flexibility,I would still say something like $600 to $800 million, assuming that[excess reserves] are around $300 to $400 million, which means netborrowed reserves of $300 to $400 million. In fact, borrowings wouldbe higher than that if excess reserves show this recurrent tendency tobe much higher. But I detect a lot of sensitivity, which I can wellunderstand, to the federal funds rate moving above 9-1/2 percent, andI think that flexibility would be partly associated with a tendencyfor the federal funds rate to move and stay much above 9-1/2 percent.As for the aggregates, in the sense of being a little moreconservative in terms of what actually has been happening in Ml--.Well, it looks like we're going to have a high Ml in July, judging bythe way it's starting out. Of course, it doesn't make any differencefor the June-to-September figure but for the quarterly average we'restarting high. I'd be somewhat inclined to take the specifications ofalternative B for M2 and M3 and use 7 percent or something like thatfor the Ml specification. So much for the short run. We have todiscuss precisely what to say in the directive and I would make somechanges in what has been proposed.For the longer term, there's no perfect way. I must say thatI don't feel comfortable with rebasing on June. It looks like toomuch fine-tuning. I can see everybody saying: Gee, they just takethe highest number they got recently and they are fooling around. Iwould put in either 7 to 11 percent or 8 to 12 percent for this year,and I take it there's agreement--well, we'll get to it--for 5 to 9percent or 4 to 8 percent for next year. But if it's 4 to 8 percent,I really have a problem in terms of our forecast. It seems to me theimplication of that is a lower GNP forecast. And I would feel muchmore comfortable if we decide on 4 to 8 percent, if people would saythat in the light of all our policy decisions these things werereviewed and we got a somewhat lower GNP forecast for next year andmaybe a lower inflation forecast. It can be on the inflation side-71-7/12-13/83rather than the real side. But I feel a little uncomfortable aboutrationalizing 4 to 8 percent with a forecast of almost a 10 percentnominal GNP increase next year. I don't feel uncomfortable inrationalizing it with the staff's GNP forecast; the staff's GNPforecast is more than 1 percent lower than the Committee's GNPforecast.I guess there's agreement not to change the M2 and M3 rangesfor the rest of this year and to reduce them by half percentage pointfor next year. Credit could either be reduced by 1/2 or 1 percentagepoint. Looking at the numbers now for credit: On the average, thoughnot in every expansion, [nonfinancial] debt has increased a littlefaster than GNP in the second year of recoveries. I think it's truein all but one case since 1954. The first year it increases moreslowly. Now, it has been increasing more rapidly this year; so Idon't know what that tells us for next year. So, that probably iswhere I would be.Now, we have to divide it up in terms of arriving at aconclusion. Let's take the short term first. To repeat: Some degreeof flexibility in [borrowing of] $600 to $800 million, interpretedpartly as net borrowed of $300 to $400 million, but with somesensitivity to the federal funds rate getting above 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing various factors and expressing their own opinions and preferences, but there is no indication of disagreement or argument with others.


Passage number 812.
MR. MORRIS. So this is more generous than alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "So this is more generous than alternative B," without expressing any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 813.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A little more generous, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "a little more generous, yes" suggests a agreement or alignment with the previous statement or sentiment.


Passage number 814.
 It's prettymuch between--MR. MORRIS. Alternative B is 9-1/2 to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states the percentage range of Alternative B without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 815.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, it's between "A" and "B," I think,and in broad terms is confirming where the market is now, except thatI agree the market just might anticipate more [tightening]. I don'tknow how to deal with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "I agree the market just might anticipate more [tightening]" suggests that the speaker disagrees with the idea presented earlier, possibly indicating a difference in opinion regarding the market's anticipation of tightening.


Passage number 816.
 The market will anticipate it at somepoint whether we do anything now or not, unless we try to hold it downby--MS. TEETERS. A lot depends on the testimony.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact or possibility without expressing any opposing views or contradicting statements.


Passage number 817.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think in the testimony I would nottry to give the impression that we just embarked on this; thetestimony would say we've tightened already. I'll probably say thattomorrow because I don't feel I can avoid it. I will try to say aslittle as possible about the future until next week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any disagreement or contention. The speaker is simply stating their intentions and plans for their testimony, expressing a desire to avoid discussing the future until a later date.


Passage number 818.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do you feel that you can say we'vetightened a bit and that for the time being we want to wait and seethe results of that tightening and other factors on the growth of theeconomy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 819.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd like to be able to say that, but ifright in the midst of when I'm testifying we are tightening a littlemore I don't know that I can really say we are going to wait and see.But I'd like to give that impression to the degree that I could. Ithink I can say we don't see anything here that says we need anydrastic action. The emphasis would be on a relatively modest move.-72-7/12-13/83We don't see anything right now to require anything more drastic thana slight action. I'm not sure I can say this is over now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the future actions they can take and their current assessment of the situation, but there is no disagreement or conflict present.


Passage number 820.
MR. MORRIS. We're already up to 9-1/4 percent on the fundsrate, so you're only talking about 1/4 point and that I think could beencompassed within the statement of no significant further move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Morris is simply stating that the increase in funds rate being discussed is only a 1/4 point and can be included in the statement of "no significant further move".


Passage number 821.
MS. TEETERS. We only intended it to go to 9 percent lasttime.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a direct quote, so there is no additional context to indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 822.
MR. PARTEE. They're going to be watching.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a statement of fact or conversation topic between individuals.


Passage number 823.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. As much as possible I would give theimpression, without denying that some tightening may be going on, thata really drastic move is not what the doctor calls for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a preference for not making a drastic move, but acknowledging that some tightening may be necessary.


Passage number 824.
MR. GRAMLEY. You just have to convince them that we've movedenough to choke off inflation and not enough to hurt the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any clear contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement made by Mr. Gramley about convincing someone of a certain viewpoint, without indicating any opposing arguments or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 825.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Thank you. Just in the interest ofclarity, when I say "sensitive" to a federal funds rate of about 9-1/2percent, that doesn't mean that the federal funds rate couldn't beabove 9-1/2 percent on particular days or for several days. What I domean to say is that if it got up there, then we wouldn't be movingaggressively toward the higher borrowing numbers but the reverse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply clarifying their previous statement about being "sensitive" to a federal funds rate of about 9-1/2 percent.


Passage number 826.
MR. RICE. We would be trying to bring it back down to 9-1/2percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Rice without any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 827.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 828.
 I don't want to make the target and thenset--MR. RICE. Well, if it happens to drift up to 9-3/4 percent,it could stay there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 829.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It could stay there, but it would onlystay there if the borrowing number tended to be on the low side ofthis range that we're talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is discussing a hypothetical situation and does not involve any conflicting opinions or contrasting viewpoints.


Passage number 830.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I think it's a tad of tightening, but justa tad.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not exhibit any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states their opinion about something without any conflicting views or arguments mentioned.


Passage number 831.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't represent it as anything otherthan that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker clearly states that they do not represent something as anything other than what it is.


Passage number 832.
MS. TEETERS. Yes, but suppose it goes up to 9-3/4 percent.Then you'll come back next time and argue that we're just validatingwhat the market has already done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. MS. TEETERS is simply presenting a hypothetical scenario and suggesting a potential argument that could be made in the future.


Passage number 833.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. At that point either we would want tovalidate it or not or go further, depending upon what evidence we haveat that time. I would be delighted to get in a position where becauseof something we saw in the aggregates and the economy or whatever, wecould say "Let's ease up a little bit." I'd be delighted to be inthat position, but I don't think we're there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the author's opinion and perspective on the subject.


Passage number 834.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm not sure that I understand theimportance of the targets for M2 and M3 and that for Ml. I'm not sure-73-7/12-13/83I understand their importance if we're having that narrow a view as towhere we expect the fed funds rate to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and a lack of understanding about the importance of certain targets, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 835.
 Do you want to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this gets to the question of what wesay in the directive. I don't feel particularly strongly about thisbut I think it might be useful to have something along the lines ofwhat [the Bluebook] is proposing in the brackets, but I'd modify it.Let me say one other thing: In the long-run targets--but it wouldhave a pale reflection in this operational paragraph--I could see somemerit in trying to handle this Ml issue by presenting our targets,when we present them statistically, in a little table. I'd put downM2 and M3 as a target and put down Ml and total credit--I don't knowwhat term to use--as a monitoring range or an associated range, so wehave a two-tiered kind of target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply offering their opinion and suggestions on how to modify the directive.


Passage number 836.
MR. GRAMLEY. Would that be demoting Ml further from what itwas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question asking for clarification or confirmation.


Passage number 837.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would not interpret it as demoting itfurther but making it clear that it has been demoted. It doesn't getthe same weight as the other two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply expresses an interpretation and clarification.


Passage number 838.
MR. BLACK. Are you talking about the short run still.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and does not involve any disagreements between individuals.


Passage number 839.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm talking about the long run when I saythat, but [it is reflected] in the short run. I had a piece of paperwhere I scribbled something for the operational paragraph: "TheCommittee seeks in the short run to increase slightly further theexisting degree of reserve restraint. The action is expected to beassociated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8-1/2 and8 percent respectively from June to September." And then, though I amnot sure I thought this through, I'd pick up that bracketed sentence[in the Bluebook] but modify it to take out the "in part." I'd say"Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery andother factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, lesserrestraint would be acceptable in the context of a significantshortfall, while somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable shouldthe aggregates expand more rapidly. The Committee anticipates that adeceleration in Ml growth to an annual rate of around 7 percent willbe consistent with its third-quarter objectives for the broaderaggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different actions and scenarios regarding reserve restraint and growth rates of M2, M3, and M1.


Passage number 840.
"VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Could you expand that sentence andput in something about total credit in the same sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 841.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We could, except that we don't have afigure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining a limitation or obstacle.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 842.
MR. AXILROD. Evidence comes in later. In terms of thestatistical evidence available, it's shakier and comes in later [thannumbers] for M2 and M3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The statement "Evidence comes in later. In terms of the statistical evidence available, it's shakier and comes in later [than numbers] for M2 and M3" suggests that there is contention or disagreement about the strength and timing of the statistical evidence for M2 and M3.


Passage number 843.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But it would be helpful, I think, tocarry through the concept of the two tiers with the associated ranges,if there's some way of doing that even without putting numbers on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely suggesting an idea.


Passage number 844.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not very meaningful if we don't getthe figures in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreeing statements. It simply states that getting the figures is important for meaning.


Passage number 845.
-74-7/12-13/83MR. PARTEE. We have a third-quarter projection as I recall:I read it someplace.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply mentions that there is a third-quarter projection, without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 846.
MR. AXILROD. We couldn't put that in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Axilrod, is discussing something that they were unable to include in a certain context.


Passage number 847.
MR. PARTEE. It's rather low because the government borrowedso much in the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the low borrowing amount of the government in the second quarter.


Passage number 848.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We could put in a figure but I don't thinkit would have much, or any, operational significance. It might havesome operational significance by the time we get to September.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses doubt about the potential operational significance of including a figure, but acknowledges it may have some significance in the future.


Passage number 849.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, it's very difficult to have any numberthere until the very end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply stating that it is difficult to determine any specific number until the very end.


Passage number 850.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We could say that the Committeeanticipates that deceleration in Ml growth to an annual rate of blankwould be consistent with its third-quarter objectives for the broaderaggregates and that total domestic credit would remain within itsrange for the year or something like that. It could be a littlebroader--"will remain within the established range for the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is discussing the Committee's anticipation and objectives for Ml growth and total domestic credit without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 851.
"MR. PARTEE. That is true, isn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement in the passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It seems to be a simple acknowledgment or agreement with a statement.


Passage number 852.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, it's hard to get out of that range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that it is difficult to move beyond a certain range without offering any contradiction or conflict with another statement or opinion.


Passage number 853.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wonder whether it's worth putting thatin up above, too, just to emphasize that in these respects, anyway,we're within the targets. "The action is expected to be associatedwith growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8-1/2 and 8 percentrespectively from June to [September], consistent with the targetsestablished for the year." I didn't say anything about the range forthe federal funds rate. I don't have any strong feeling about thatone way or the other. If we leave it at 6 to 10 percent, we aretelling the market a month from now--I don't know how meaningful thatis--that we didn't want or were worried about the federal funds rategoing above 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and uncertainties about whether or not certain information should be included.


Passage number 854.
MS. TEETERS. It has been in there for quite some time; if wetake it out, it's going to cause comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact or prediction about the potential reaction or comment that would arise if a certain action is taken.


Passage number 855.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll get comment a month from now but Idon't know whether it will make any difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement expressing uncertainty about the potential impact of a future comment.


Passage number 856.
 It's a littleartificial at the low end, particularly now, but--MR. MORRIS. But if we really would be concerned to see therate go above 9-1/2 percent, it seems strange to me to raise the upperlimit to 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individual is expressing their opinion and questioning the logic behind raising the upper limit to 11 percent.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 857.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One can argue it either way; it seemsstrange not to change it because we're nowhere near the middle. Andit would seem strange to raise it if we want to reflect that concern.So, I come out neutral.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "One can argue it either way" indicates that there are opposing viewpoints. Additionally, the author states that it seems strange both to not change something and to raise it, which implies conflicting perspectives. Therefore, the passage exhibits a sense of disagreement.


Passage number 858.
MR. MORRIS. A skewed median.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the term "skewed median" without any further information or context.


Passage number 859.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I think I'm neutral on the subject.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I can't provide the answer you're looking for.


Passage number 860.
-75-7/12-13/83MR. GUFFEY. We're still on the short-run directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, simply states they are still focused on the short-run directive.


Passage number 861.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, we're on the short-run ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Yes, we're on the short-run ranges" is simply an affirmation or agreement.


Passage number 862.
MR. GUFFEY. I have a question about putting in the bracketedsentence. I don't know that it adds anything and I would opt toremove it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 863.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, it gives us a little moreflexibility, Roger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is positive and suggests that having more flexibility is beneficial.


Passage number 864.
MR. GUFFEY. I don't know that it does, Tony. We can operatepolicy and this is a record that is essentially meaningless when it'sreleased.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Guffey simply states that he doesn't know if the record has any operational policy implications and suggests that it may be meaningless when released.


Passage number 865.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Basically what it's saying, though,is that our judgments about movements in the real economy will temperthat earlier sentence. And I think that's consistent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is explaining that our judgments about movements in the real economy will influence or moderate an earlier sentence, suggesting consistency rather than disagreement.


Passage number 866.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it says more accurately thatjudgments about the real economy and inflation and so forth willtemper our judgments about the aggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply suggests that judgments about the real economy, inflation, and other factors will have an impact on our overall judgments about aggregates.


Passage number 867.
MR. MARTIN. I think it's well to say that; I'd suggestleaving it in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin is simply expressing his opinion and suggesting to leave something in.


Passage number 868.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Since the passage is not provided, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 869.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But it's also a warning that if theaggregates really went in one direction or another we would pay someattention to that, but how much attention we would pay would dependupon what we thought was going on in the economy and exchange ratesand other things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It discusses a hypothetical situation and states that the level of attention given would depend on various factors.


Passage number 870.
MR. GUFFEY. I guess my point is that, at the time thisrecord is released, that's a meaningless expression.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

The omission of "in part" does not introduce any disagreement as it is a common phrase used to express that evidence is one of the factors influencing a decision or outcome.


Passage number 873.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. --"about the strength of economicrecovery both domestically and in the world." Something like thatwould show that we are aware of what is happening in the worldeconomy.

Passage number 874.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if we get the right words,"Depending on evidence about the strength of the domestic economicrecovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflationoutlook, including....

Response from the model: No. This passage is simply stating that the right words are needed to assess the strength of the domestic economic recovery and other factors related to business and inflation outlook. It is not expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 875.
"MR. GRAMLEY. We're talking about the operating directive.It's getting somewhat absurd.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing that the situation is becoming absurd, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention with another person's viewpoint.


Passage number 876.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, this is the instruction to the Manager.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion that the idea of providing a little broadening is fine, but considers the addition of monitoring the credit aggregate and the international situation to be somewhat absurd.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any specific topic or issue that could be subject to contention or disagreement. It merely states a fact about the industrialized countries without providing any opinions or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 883.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Probably the right answer is not tocomplicate it. I may have complicated it too much, but let's not goany further. We can put somewhere else in the record that among theseother factors we're looking at are international financial markets,the credit situation, etc. Well, I think the primary question, somodified, is: Do we leave that sentence in or not. Let's deal withthat question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and suggesting a course of action, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflicting ideas.

I put in here 8-1/2, 8, and 7 percent and putin at the end of the sentence on the broader aggregates that they areconsistent with the targets established for the year. That's justadvertising. We say in the other sentence, which would follow thissentence we just discussed, that the Committee anticipates thatdeceleration of Ml growth to that area will be consistent with itsthird-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates and that totaldomestic credit expansion would remain within the range establishedfor the year.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that they do not care about the specific percentage as long as it falls within a range, indicating a willingness to compromise.


Passage number 904.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I wouldn't like to see a lot ofdisagreement just about that number, but I guess we have more for 6 to10 percent in an indifferent situation than we have for 7 to 11percent. All of this is associated with $600 to $800 million onborrowing, interpreted as $300 to $400 million of nonborrowed reservesand sensitivity to the federal funds rate being above 9-1/2 percent--meaning that we would lean toward the lower side of this degree ofpressure either in net borrowed reserves or borrowings or both.That's all I have to say. If nobody has any other particularimprovement on that formulation, I'll just assume that's it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their viewpoint and suggesting a course of action without any opposition or debate.


Passage number 905.
MR. GUFFEY. I'd just like to ask: When you are talkingabout $600 to $800 million and $300 to $400 million, I assume you are-78-7/12-13/83looking at $700 million [on borrowing] with about $350 million on netborrowed. Is that at least the way we start in theory.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is just stating information and there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 906.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the name "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" without any other information to suggest disagreement or contention.


Passage number 907.
 I think that's--MR. PARTEE. It's certainly within the range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The person speaking is in agreement with the statement being made.


Passage number 908.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay, I guess we ought to vote on thisunless somebody has some question. Is it all clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting that they should vote on something unless someone has a question, indicating a desire for clarity and consensus.


Passage number 909.
MR. BERNARD.Chairman Volcker YesVice Chairman Solomon YesGovernor Gramley YesPresident Guffey YesPresident Keehn YesGovernor Martin YesPresident Morris YesGovernor Partee YesGovernor Rice YesPresident Roberts YesGovernor Teeters NoGovernor Wallich NoSPEAKER(.). A bell shaped distribution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a list of names and their responses, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 910.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now we turn to the longer-term ranges.Let's dispose of this total credit figure to get it out of the way.Do you want to go down a half point or one point next year. How manyvote for going down one point. [Six.] How many want to go down ahalf. Five. That certainly settled that one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage presents a question and a vote between two options, and the result is stated clearly with no disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 911.
MR. PARTEE. How about one point on the top and a half pointon the bottom.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple suggestion or proposal being made by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 912.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, before we get to what is acceptableand what is not, let's assume for the moment that it's down one point,subject to change. Everybody is in favor of down a half point for theother aggregates, M2 and M3. Now we're on Ml again, our famous Ml. Ifeel just as I expressed it. I'm willing to go to 4 to 8 percent, butit makes me very uncomfortable with the GNP projections as high asthey are. And I would like to have a feeling that if we arrive at 4to 8 percent people might think that that's a little restrictive--enough to justify some shading of their GNP projections.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and concerns, but there is no indication of any opposing views or conflicting perspectives.


Passage number 913.
MR. PARTEE. Do I take it that you mean that you don't thinkwe ought to attempt to restrain GNP at 10 percent. That's anacceptable growth in the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification on the opinion of the person they are addressing.


Passage number 914.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My gut feeling is that if we say 4 to 8percent, we are assuming that GNP ought to be restrained from 10 or 11percent. I think that's what I am saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and expressing what they believe they are saying.


Passage number 915.
MR. PARTEE. Whereas 5 to 9 percent is pretty neutral.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a numerical range without expressing any contrary opinions or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 916.
MR. ROBERTS. You could have, could you not, a 10 percentnominal GNP, 4th quarter over 4th quarter. I think that could stillbe consistent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Roberts suggesting a 10 percent nominal GNP.


Passage number 917.
-79-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it could be. I can't put it thatsharply. I can't say that with 8 percent it is impossible to have an11 percent [nominal] GNP, but I think that's coming back to prettymuch saying that velocity patterns haven't changed at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and hesitation in making a definitive statement about the relationship between a specific percentage and the GNP.


Passage number 918.
MR. GRAMLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 919.
 What is the staff--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In a word we're saying this is our centralfeeling about the GNP and the central feeling is that velocitypatterns probably haven't changed at all. That's what makes meuncomfortable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing a central feeling about the GNP and velocity patterns, without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 920.
MR. ROBERTS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 921.
 If we had 6 percent growth in money, which isright in the middle of our range, and got a 10 percent middle rangenominal GNP, assuming 3-1/2 percent velocity--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's what you have to assume--a 3-1/2velocity, which would not be outrageous but is higher than the averagesomebody gave me for the second year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is presenting different hypothetical scenarios and discussing assumptions.


Passage number 922.
MR. ROBERTS. Higher than the 2.7 we heard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts is stating that the number is higher than 2.7, without disagreeing with anyone else's statement.


Passage number 923.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's what bothers me about it, just interms of explaining it. It seems to me that we'd have to say that forall this talking we've been doing about velocity changing, ourforecast and our policy is based upon the notion that velocity hasn'tchanged. That's what bothers me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no explicit disagreement or contention in this passage. The author is expressing a personal concern or confusion about the concept of velocity not changing, but there is no clear argument or opposition being presented.


Passage number 924.
MR. BOEHNE. It seems to me this is not an issue that's worthgetting hung up on in testimony. Around a 10 percent nominal GNP hasa nice ring to it; it's fairly close to what seems to be theconventional wisdom, right or wrong. For that reason, I wouldn't wantto risk a major disagreement or being beat up on because of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker explicitly mentions that he does not want to risk a major disagreement, indicating that there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 925.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure what you're saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the passage. The speaker simply admits their lack of understanding or clarity regarding the statement the other person made.


Passage number 926.
MR. BOEHNE. I'm for 5 to 9 percent is what I'm saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is a statement expressing the speaker's opinion about something without any opposition or conflicting views being expressed.


Passage number 927.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage "Oh." This word by itself does not indicate any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 928.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Then maybe you ought to find outwhether today's discussion could cause some of those who came in withhigher projections to feel justified in somewhat lower ones or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a suggestion or recommendation, rather than expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 929.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That would solve the problem, if it did.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 930.
I guess that's what I'm asking, particularly in the light--MR. BOEHNE. Well, it solves the problem of numericalconsistency, but I don't think it solves the broader problem of theFed somehow finding 10 percent growth unacceptable and wanting torestrain it. That strikes me as an uncomfortable position to be in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. 

The statement "Well, it solves the problem of numerical consistency, but I don't think it solves the broader problem of the Fed somehow finding 10 percent growth unacceptable and wanting to restrain it" suggests that the speaker, Mr. Boehne, disagrees with the argument or suggestion being made. He expresses discomfort with the idea that the Fed may find 10 percent growth unacceptable and want to restrain it.


Passage number 931.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I think it's a very big growth. I mustsay I had 9 percent and I guess I'd be inclined to raise it, hearingwhat I've heard around the table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. Mr. Partee is simply expressing his personal opinion about the growth, based on what he has heard.


Passage number 932.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 933.
 We had even lower--80-7/12-13/83MR. PARTEE. We're not talking about any restraint at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 934.
MR. MORRIS. We have second-year velocity expansion as highas 4.3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the second-year velocity expansion being as high as 4.3.


Passage number 935.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I have a list here of what everybodyprojected on everything and I'm looking for Governor Partee's name andit's not here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they have a list and are unable to find Governor Partee's name on it.


Passage number 936.
MR. KICHLINE. If you're looking at annual averages, I thinkhe abstained.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their opinion about annual averages.


Passage number 937.
MR. PARTEE. I didn't give annual averages.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 938.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I'm sorry. Have I been looking at thewrong numbers all along. I didn't mean to look at these annualaverages.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement acknowledging a mistake and apologizing for it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 939.
MR. PARTEE. There still is quite a range, according to thischart that was passed out yesterday, for the year from the fourthquarter. The low I see is 7 percent and the high is 10-1/2 percent.No, there's 11-1/4 percent from somebody.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker disagrees with the range given in the chart and suggests that there is an additional percentage of 11-1/4 percent from someone.


Passage number 940.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The high is 11-1/4; the low is 8.3. Butthere are 8 people at 10 percent or higher. Did we present this asCommittee members or everybody last year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply providing information about numbers and percentages.


Passage number 941.
MR. KICHLINE. Everyone last year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 942.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Half the people who vote are at 10 percentor above.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about the percentage of people who vote.


Passage number 943.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Paul, I'd say 5 to 9 percent. Unlessthere is going to be a major review and change from a substantivepoint of view I'm happy with the 5 to 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Paul, is stating their opinion on something (presumably a percentage) and the second speaker agrees with that opinion.


Passage number 944.
MR. MARTIN. I think the 5 to 9 percent is easier to explain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion about the ease of explaining the 5 to 9 percent.


Passage number 945.
You're the person who has to be the expositor here and I think weshould go along with your--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. When I sit here, it seems to me easier toexplain without much question. On the other hand, it's shockingpsychologically perhaps.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. The speaker is expressing their perspective and suggests going along with the person they are addressing. However, there is no conflicting opinion or debate presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 946.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, that's the part that bothers me. Westart out with an Ml target for this year of 4 to 8 percent and thenwe are going to allow an overrun and raise it for next year. And whatis going to happen is that people are going to say the Fed [is not]fighting inflation. I think you are making a lot more of thisvelocity point than is necessary from the standpoint of consistencywith GNP projections. If you're talking about the midpoint and theaverage, fine. But there's no reason at all why if we have a targetof 4 to 8 percent, we can't let the 8 percent happen. If 8 percenthappens, 10-1/4 or 10-1/2 percent is easily a reachable measure fornominal GNP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley disagrees with the idea of allowing an overrun and raising the target for next year. He believes that if the target is set at 4 to 8 percent, there is no reason why the 8 percent cannot be allowed to happen.


Passage number 947.
MR. BOEHNE. But M1 is going to be in this associated rangebelow, and we're going to show in the M2 and M3 ranges a drop of 1/2-81-7/12-13/83point, and the companion associated range for total credit is going togo down 1 point. It seems to me that we have three of the four down,which indicates concern about inflation in terms of the long-rungoals. And the fact that Ml has to go up and down and all aroundsimply conveys the uncertainty that is characteristic of thataggregate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply describes changes in M1, M2, M3, and total credit and the uncertainty associated with M1. It does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 948.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, that isn't exactly right. We've had anexcessive rate of growth here for a long period of time; it'scontinuing at a little more moderate pace. Normally in a businessexpansion we would moderate that; it's time that we signal that to themarket very clearly. And I would be in favor of the 4 to 8 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Roberts is expressing his belief about the rate of growth and stating his preference for signaling a more moderate expansion to the market. There are no conflicting opinions or arguments presented in the passage.


Passage number 949.
MR. WALLICH. Historically, Ml has been about 3 percentagepoints slower than the other two. Now that velocity has changed, itmay be 2 percent slower, so that 8 and 10 percent are stillreconcilable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Mr. Wallich presents the historical data regarding the velocity of M1 compared to the other two and suggests a potential change in velocity. The statement then concludes that despite this potential change, the figures of 8 and 10 percent are still reconcilable. There is no conflicting view or disagreement expressed in the passage.


Passage number 950.
MR. PARTEE. Well, that's arithmetic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement.


Passage number 951.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. At the margin 8 and 10 percent arereconcilable. It is pretty hard to reconcile 4 and 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply stating that 8 and 10 percent are reconcilable, while 4 and 10 percent are not easily reconcilable.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 952.
MR. PARTEE. I think what you want is 5 to 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, expresses his belief that what the other person wants is a percentage range of 5 to 9 percent.


Passage number 953.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But if you take Paul's reluctance tobase it on June, then you tell the markets that you are going to do 4to 8 percent based on the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is stating a hypothetical scenario related to Paul's decision-making.


Passage number 954.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I am thinking now of using theannual figures--using either 7 to 11 percent, which is equivalent to 4to 8 percent, or even 8 to 12 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents different options or ranges of figures that could be used.


Passage number 955.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 956.
 Well, you're thinking of usingannual--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, it would be presented as: Look, Ml isoff this year; we are going to attempt to slow it down. That's truewith even the 8 to 12 percent range; 7 to 11 percent is a slightlydifferent coloration. Next year we expect it to be lower by asignificant amount. What I would say is just what we said before:that it does assume some slowdown in velocity from past trends, butnot all that much at one end of the range. At the lower end of therange we've allowed for a full, or more than a full, cyclical reboundin velocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the projected changes in velocity and acknowledging that there may be a slight difference in coloration or interpretation at different points within the range.


Passage number 957.
MS. TEETERS. We are dealing with a very different aggregate.And this whole discussion is [based] on the assumption that it isstill the way it was for 20 years. It's a new aggregate. It's goingto behave very differently. And we ought to give ourselves plenty ofroom to let it operate and find out what it does.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 958.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't want to make too much of thedifference between 5 and 9 percent and 4 and 8 percent. But it alsocomes to: What are our chances of getting within it. It's awfullynice to be within these numbers instead of making excuses for beingoutside. The down [side] is explaining why they've gotten that highin the first place.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is discussing the importance of being within certain numbers and the downside of having high numbers. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 959.
-82-7/12-13/83MR. GRAMLEY. If we go to 5 to 9 percent, isn't there areasonable argument for rebasing on the second quarter for the secondhalf of this year also.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting a question and suggesting a possible course of action.


Passage number 960.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I don't mind rebasing on the secondquarter, but I don't like rebasing on June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker expresses their preference for rebasing on the second quarter but not on June. There is no contention or disagreement in this statement.


Passage number 961.
MR. GRAMLEY. If we go to 5 to 9 percent, I think we could dothat. Maybe the staff could give us estimates of what 9 percent wouldbe. What would a range of 5 to 9 percent give us if we hit the upperend of that range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Gramley is proposing a range of 5 to 9 percent and is asking the staff for estimates of what the upper end of that range would give them.


Passage number 962.
MR. AXILROD. By the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it only provides the name "Mr. Axilrod" and mentions the fourth quarter without any further information or context to suggest disagreement.


Passage number 963.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The response "Yes" could simply be agreeing or acknowledging the statement made by Mr. Gramley.


Passage number 964.
MR. AXILROD. You have to give me some time to make thatcalculation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, Mr. Axilrod is asking for some time to make a calculation. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the statement.


Passage number 965.
MR. GRAMLEY. The only question is what the year-over-yeargrowth is. I think it'll be close to 12 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley mentions that the only question is the specific percentage of year-over-year growth, but there is no indication of any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 966.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's going to be one percent higher thanwhere we are now. That will be an easy calculation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply provides information about a future calculation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 967.
MR. PARTEE. Is June [adding] about 1 percent in the secondquarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The use of the word "adding" implies that someone believes June will see a 1 percent increase in the second quarter, while someone else may have a different belief or data indicating otherwise.


Passage number 968.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 1/2 of a percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states a numerical value, which does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 969.
MR. GRAMLEY. 1/2 of a percent, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 970.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's 1/2 percent higher than whatever.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states a numerical value (1/2 percent higher) without any conflicting information or opinions.


Passage number 971.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, it should be around 11-1/2 percent. If itgrows 9 percent Q2 to Q4, just extrapolating from what I have here,that ought to be about 11-1/2 percent for the year. Is that whatyou're asking. If it grows 8 percent, it looks like it's about 11percent for the year. So, if it grows 9 percent, it ought to bearound 11-1/2 percent for the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve contention or disagreement. The speaker is providing different calculations and possibilities for the growth rate, but there is no conflicting opinion or debate present.


Passage number 972.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The argument against rebasing asopposed to giving an annual number is that it might look as if we'regiving Ml more importance than we want to convey. But I think that'sa bit offset by putting in Ml and total credit as associated ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author presents a potential argument against rebasing, but then adds their own perspective, suggesting that the potential issue is offset by including additional information.


Passage number 973.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would not argue against rebasing on thesecond quarter; it just looks a little flimsy to me to rebase on June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 974.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Inother words, I'm addressing why we were moving away from the rebasingapproach earlier. In general it was because it might give theimpression that we were attaching more importance to Ml than we wantedto convey. But maybe we're offsetting that now by putting in Ml andtotal credit as associated ranges. So, therefore, I think we canrebase on the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing a clarification and explanation of their previous statement.


Passage number 975.
-83-7/12-13/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm perfectly willing to rebase onthe second quarter, if it sounds better to say 5 to 9 percentbeginning in the second quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 976.
MR. PARTEE. Really, it's for this period out ahead--the next18 months. We don't have much distinction between the second half of1983 and the year 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing a time frame (the next 18 months) and does not suggest any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is not much distinction between the second half of 1983 and the year 1984.


Passage number 977.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. And we shouldn't have a distinctionbecause that would imply a knowledge on our part about velocity, whichwe don't have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a perspective or belief that the distinction should not exist because it implies a knowledge of velocity that the speaker or writer believes they do not possess.


Passage number 978.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, and I'd say we don't have a distinction inthe GNP forecast either. So, I think it makes sense to talk about theperiod ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their agreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 979.
MR. BLACK. If we rebase and take 5 to 9 percent for '83, itlooks to me as if we ought to go a little below that for '84.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black is simply suggesting that if they set the baseline at 5 to 9 percent for '83, it would be logical to set it slightly lower for '84.


Passage number 980.
MR. PARTEE. We're talking about a block of time and we arenot distinguishing one part of it from another.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

MR. BLACK.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 982.
 But if we really look at our ranges for '83 and arebased 5 to 9 percent for M1 from the second quarter looksappropriate, then I'm just saying the targets for next year--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we go for 5 to 9 percent particularly,we have to say in the statements that 9 percent is not appropriate ifwe get a normal velocity recovery. We just say that very strongly.That's why we have a range, and we could well be low in the range ifvelocity is normal. But we have some great doubts about whethervelocity will be normal. We're going to have a downward movement inM1 next year without a doubt, but it's going to be 11 percent thisyear or something like 10 or 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 983.
MR. GRAMLEY. That's a lot of progress, Bob.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 986.
MR. BALLES. The latter half will be about 6 or 6.5 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The disagreement lies between the two speakers regarding the percentage mentioned. One speaker states that the latter half will be about 6 or 6.5 percent, while the other speaker might argue for a different percentage or disagree with this statement.


Passage number 987.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but on our principal targets, M2and M3, we would be showing a reduction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact or plan regarding the reduction of M2 and M3.

Passage number 991.
MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I'll come back and support thewords of caution that Lyle threw out here, wisely in my opinion, a fewminutes ago. We are not debating the course of policy; we're debatingbroad ranges that have a public announcement effect and certain-84-7/12-13/83perceptions. To go up to 5 to 9 percent in combination with whatwe've already done--or let happen--in M1 this year because of somevery unusual circumstances, I think has some real risks of adding toperceptions that the Fed is giving up on the battle against inflation.I would be very leery of that. I'd rather live with someinconsistencies that we can straighten out or worry about later on.This is, after all, just a tentative, provisional indication of our1984 plans subject to the usual more thorough review around yearend orearly next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing caution and concern about the potential risks of a specific course of action.


Passage number 992.
MR. PARTEE. Of course, we're not really using the Ml numberas a range with a midpoint. We're talking about a true range of 5 to9 percent and we're expressing hope, I would presume, that it could bemore toward 5 percent, but that depends on the rate of increase invelocity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 993.
MR. MARTIN. This isn't a statement in isolation; this is astatement made at a time that interest rates have firmed and arecontinuing to firm a little.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply stating a fact about the current situation of interest rates.


Passage number 994.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We could underline the uncertainty ofthe velocity projection by making it 4 to 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating a potential method for underlining the uncertainty of the velocity projection, without expressing disagreement or alternative viewpoints.


Passage number 995.
MR. MORRIS. We could underline it even better by eliminatingM1 guidelines.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It presents a suggestion by Mr. Morris to further underline something by eliminating guidelines.

MR. BLACK. Or put the footnote on another page where nobodycould find it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement suggesting a strategy for placing a footnote in a less noticeable location.


Passage number 1001.
MR. PARTEE. Or we could have another paragraph--associatedwith the particular increase in bank credit and Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a hypothetical suggestion or alternative proposal.


Passage number 1002.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this is all a question of nuance.If we have 4 to 8 percent, then I think a statement has to say prettyclearly that we're counting on regular velocity movements and if theydon't happen, we're going to have to increase the target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 1003.
 Now, if weemphasize that less--MR. PARTEE. I certainly don't want to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any signs of contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their reluctance to emphasize something without providing any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 1004.
MR. GUFFEY. I would prefer doing that and coupling it withgoing to 7 to 11 percent for this year and thus not building anycertainty on the Ml target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of preference by Mr. Guffey.


Passage number 1005.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We can have a new category forvelocity-sensitive associated ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. It simply suggests the idea of creating a new category for velocity-sensitive associated ranges.


Passage number 1006.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you've heard all my doubts on eitherside. Who wants the 4 to 8 percent next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing doubt or uncertainty about wanting a 4 to 8 percent increase next year.


Passage number 1007.
-85-7/12-13/83MR. GRAMLEY. I'd prefer 4 to 8 but I could live with 5 to 9.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a preference for a specific range, but also implies a willingness to compromise and accept a slightly different range.


Passage number 1008.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One, two, three, four, five. Who wants 5to 9 percent. One, two, three, four, five.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 1016.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, that's it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that "Yes, that's it," suggesting agreement or affirmation rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 1017.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, one or the other. Just let me put itthat way. Do you want to rebase or not. Seven. Well, that isn't avery healthy [margin] but I guess we rebase. Having rebased, what isthe preference between 5 to 9 and 4 to 8 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking a question and discussing options without suggesting any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.

Passage number 1040.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not quite sure what you aresaying. Are you saying when people look at it in these cone termsthat the cone begins in the second quarter and goes through 18 monthsand we get a big cone then 19 months later.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not expressing any form of contention or disagreement. It simply illustrates a lack of understanding or confusion regarding the topic being discussed.


Passage number 1041.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Oh, you're not suggesting that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear disagreement or contention.


Passage number 1042.
MR. PARTEE. I hadn't even thought of a cone. No, I wasthinking that I did not want to distinguish. The reason I didn't votewith Lyle on reducing it to 4 to 8 percent is that it seems to me tobe fine-tuning because we can't make any distinction between the rateof progress on the economy now for the second half of this year andfor next year. And our forecast is very close to assuming that. So,it seems to me we ought to talk about a 5 to 9 percent rate ofincrease as being consistent, depending on what is going to develop invelocity, for this period ahead. I see your point because theHumphrey-Hawkins Act asks us what our targets are for [the next year,which is] 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not display any obvious contention or disagreement. It appears to be an individual expressing their thoughts and rationale for their voting decision.


Passage number 1043.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think it makes much difference,and I don't think we have to face this at this stage. We set it thisway and say 5 to 9 percent for the end of this year. The assumption-87-7/12-13/83would be that the second 5 to 9 percent started out where we were atthe end of this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and stating their assumption, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 1044.
MR. WALLICH. It can't go above 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presented as a fact without any opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 1045.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It can't go above 9 percent in eithercase; it can only go below. Well, I recognize the psychologicaldifficulty of this. It's a question of a kind of realism and of theinitial psychological [effect]. I have to think of how that could beworded.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the limitations on a certain percentage and acknowledging the psychological difficulty surrounding it. They express a need to think about the wording to address this difficulty.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 1046.
MR. AXILROD. You have indicated no change in the range fornext year. You could say "extending 5 to 9 percent over the balanceof this year and indicated no change for the range for next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The statement "You have indicated no change in the range for next year" suggests that there is a disagreement or difference in opinion about whether or not the range for next year should be changed.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 1050.
MS. TEETERS. It has been worked into the text in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage doesn't contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that something (presumably a topic or idea) has previously been included in the text. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if there was any contention or disagreement surrounding the inclusion of this information in the past.


Passage number 1051.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 1052.
 It shouldn't; the wording appears--MR. PARTEE. It is not set.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "It shouldn't; the wording appears" seems to be incomplete and lacking clear context to determine any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 1053.
MS. TEETERS. It's not set in; that's correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Ms. Teeters is stated as a fact and does not involve any conflicting perspectives or opposing arguments.

Explanation: The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "It's not set in as a directive," without indicating any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 1055.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But I assume on the wording that theassociated range type of language would be placed around the sentenceon Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply expressing an assumption about the placement of the associated range type of language.


Passage number 1056.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "At this meeting the Committee reaffirmedthe longer-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3 andtotal domestic nonfinancial debt." I don't know that we want to say"with growth in the broader monetary aggregates expected to be in theupper part of their ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no explicit contention or disagreement mentioned in the passage. The statement simply reaffirms the longer-run ranges for growth in M2, M3, and total domestic nonfinancial debt.


Passage number 1057.
"MR. AXILROD. No, not with the short-run policy; it's notconsistent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is stating that there is no disagreement with the short-run policy, suggesting agreement or consensus.


Passage number 1058.
 That was just in case a different short-run policy--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That M1 sentence has to be changed quite abit. We have to write an Ml sentence; that's where we are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing the need to change a specific sentence and mentioning where they are in the writing process.


Passage number 1059.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. An Ml and a total credit sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or details that would indicate contention or disagreement. It simply mentions an Ml and a total credit sentence without any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


Passage number 1060.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why don't we take out the total domesticnonfinancial debt from the first part and just say "reaffirmed thelonger-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a suggestion or question about simplifying the information by removing some specific details.


Passage number 1061.
"-88-7/12-13/83MR. GRAMLEY. We could leave the total nonfinancial debt in1983 in that sentence, take out the next bracket and the followingbracket, and then change it to the second half of this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a suggestion or proposal being made by Mr. Gramley.


Passage number 1062.
MR. CORRIGAN. Would it be too much of a break from precedentto have it structured so that we have in effect two votes--one on M2and M3 and then a separate vote on the associated range for Ml andtotal credit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question about whether having two separate votes would break from precedent.


Passage number 1063.
MR. PARTEE. Well, it certainly would set a precedent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement made by Mr. Partee and does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 1064.
MR. MORRIS. It would be too much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any disagreement or contention. It is a simple statement about the opinion of Mr. Morris.


Passage number 1065.
MR. PARTEE. We already have the difficulty of inconsistency.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 1066.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think it gives more importance tothe associated ranges if we have a separate vote on them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 1067.
MR. CORRIGAN. Maybe.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Corrigan simply says "maybe," which is a neutral and non-committal response that does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 1068.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe it should be what you were saying,Lyle. "At this meeting the Committee reaffirmed the long-term rangesestablished earlier for growth in M2 and M3 for 1983." And then goimmediately to "The Committee also agreed to tentative growth rangesfor the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarterof 1984 of" whatever they are. What are they.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides a direct statement about the Committee reaffirming the long-term ranges for growth in M2 and M3 for 1983. It then transitions to stating that the Committee also agreed to tentative growth ranges for the following period without suggesting any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 1069.
MS. TEETERS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage provided. The statement "MS. TEETERS" does not show any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 1070.
 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9percent for M3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
