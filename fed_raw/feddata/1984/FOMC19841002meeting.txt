We can start, if somebody wants to movethe minutes.MR. MARTIN. I move the minutes, Mr. Chairman.SPEAKER(?). Second.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Let's turn to foreigncurrency operations.MR. CROSS. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Perhaps you could refresh my memory andthat of others as to the nature of this informal limit.MR. CROSS. We raised the total amount of this limit and theDM amount. The total [informal limit] is now $5-1/2 billion.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What is the operative significance of thisinformal limit?MR. CROSS. Well, it is an informal limit. We have a formallimit of $8 billion, which is recorded and registered as the decisionof the FOMC and I imagine made public. This $5-1/2 billion is aninformal limit, which has been operative for a number of years, underwhich we seek the FOMC's views about how much we would operate withinour total authorized $8 billion. We now have an informal maximum of$5-1/2 billion for all currencies, with [limits of] $4 billion indeutschemarks, $1 billion in yen, and $500 million in othercurrencies.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Suppose we were not having a Committeemeeting and these limits were threatened to be exceeded?MR. CROSS. I believe you have the authority--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No, there is an Executive Committee--a 3-person subcommittee.MR. CROSS. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee could authorizeit.MR. GRAMLEY. What are your present holdings?MR. CROSS. The present holding of DM is $3.9 billionequivalent. Our limit is $4 billion equivalent and I am requesting--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If the mark increased in value, we wouldexceed the limit?MR. CROSS. No. These are recorded on [the basis of]historical acquisition costs. We could never operate in this day andage if we were operating on the basis of market value.MR. PARTEE. We haven't done much with this for a long time,10/2/84I must say, and I am sure everybody's mind is very fuzzy on it--atleast mine is. Why is it, Sam, that we take the interest in marksrather than converting it to dollars?MR. CROSS. Well, if we converted it into dollars, that wouldbe, in effect, an intervention operation.MR. PARTEE. But it would be a very regularized small thingthat would permit us to get [the interest earnings] back into our owncurrency.MR. CROSS. It is not as though we have such massive amountsof these currencies that we need to worry about our balances being toohigh, it seems to me. As I say, the United States [holdings] as awhole are way below what they were even a couple of years ago.MR. PARTEE. Well, that is true. It's not even as much asthe Continental loan. Nevertheless, a lot of people might consider $4billion in marks to be quite a holding, particularly when you recallthat we got most of it at under 2.MR. CROSS. Well, the total value of these at today'sexchange rate would be less than $3.9 billion. So, I think we aretalking about a very modest amount of currencies and it is in ourinterest to have some of these currencies available.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I assume you are not interested indriving the value of the dollar up any higher?MR. PARTEE. I don't know what the periodic receipts are, butthey certainly can't exceed $100 million. I guess I would have arguedthat it would not have had any appreciable effect on the dollar had wedone this periodically when we get them as a convention. And I don'tknow why it is--MR. CROSS. We get about $200 million per year.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think that's true if you believethat there is a principle involved here, but I don't know what theprinciple is. You're assuming that all interest on foreign currenciesshould as a matter of routine be converted to dollars? Is that whatyou're saying?MR. PARTEE. I don't know why it shouldn't be. I considerthe home currency to be the dollar rather than the mark!VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That still is a form of intervention,so I don't understand why you would want to do that unless you had anintervention objective in mind.MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't remember the basis for doing itthis way.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Whether or not it's intervention seems tome semantic. The question is whether we feel comfortable oruncomfortable with the amount of currencies we hold. I personallyfeel that we hold an uncomfortably small amount.10/2/84MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, it seems conceivable that we mayneed more than $500 million over the next year, so why not increasethe informal limit by $1 billion instead of $500 million?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm perfectly happy to.MR. MARTIN. I certainly support that.MR. CROSS. I would welcome an increase of $1 billion.MR. MARTIN. Is there some significance that you didn'tarticulate to the $500 million?MR. CROSS. No. It's just that the past couple of times whenwe raised it, we increased it by $500 million and I did not want togive the impression that there was anything very major involved. Itseems to me it would be quite appropriate--and in fact it would beadvisable--to increase it by $1 billion.MR. MARTIN. The inevitability of gradualism! I'd go for abillion dollars. Operationally, I think it makes sense.MR. PARTEE. Well, I really don't know why we have [aninformal limit]. I would move to do away with it altogether. Afterall, at the rate at which interest is accumulating we will double ourmoney every six or seven years anyhow.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not at German interest rates or [rates on]Swiss francs.MR. MARTIN. Let's hope not.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, do what you want to do, but it seemsto me that this informal limit may be useful within the overall limitof $8 billion. It confuses me a bit as to what it is, but at theminimum it is some kind of Committee checkpoint. It is $5.5 billionpresently. I don't think it does any harm and it forces the Committeeto review this, though not very frequently. It hasn't been reviewedfor however long it has been, but it seems to me it has at least amodest usefulness and I would think we probably would want to keep it.I have no problem with [an increase of] $1 billion. I think that'smore appropriate, but that's because my bias is that we don't holdenough of these currencies anyway against the contingencies of anunknown world.MR. GRAMLEY. Then we'd want to raise the informal maximumfor all currencies to $6 billion from $5-1/2 billion too?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it would be $6-1/2 billion.MR. CROSS. $6-1/2 billion and raise the total for all ofthem?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Actually, the yen is within $400 million[of its limit]. It's not so far away but the amount is not very largeeither--not that it is very difficult to change these.10/2/84MR. CROSS. Another possibility, Mr. Chairman, if you wantedto consider it, would be to keep the informal limit on the total butto eliminate this difference between how much is in DM and how much isin yen, and how much is in Swiss francs and other currencies. Thatwould provide a little more flexibility.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, without taking that major step, Itake it this is an understanding and not a formal [vote]. And I takeit that what the understanding really means is that these are ourforeign currency [limits] but in an emergency I can breach them. Butthe sense is that the Committee is thinking in terms of these [limits]and if they were breached I would come back to the Committee at somepoint and I would at least explain why they were breached. Limits of$5 billion [on DM], $1 billion [on yen] and $.5 billion [on othercurrencies] is the minimum change we're talking about. If there areno widespread objections to that, we will proceed.We've had a very strange exchange market during this period,as Mr. Cross has described, and he rationalized as best he could whythe dollar is so strong. It's not so clear why it's so strong againstdeclining interest [rates], weaker economic activity, and severaldevelopments indicating an easier Federal Reserve policy, all of whichin days of yore--like two months ago--would have sent the dollar down.They don't seem to have any effect right now.MR. CROSS. I would certainly agree that there is no veryclear-cut explanation. It is amazing how much the attitudes [havechanged]; everybody seems to talk about what a good thing the dollaris to get into these days. One can listen to how they talk now andthink back to how they talked in 1978 and 1979 when it was going theother way and the United States was [viewed as] hopeless as far as thefuture was concerned. It's hard to believe they are talking about thesame country.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There was very widespread and deep concernabout this among European Finance Ministers and central bankers--really for the first time, so far as central bankers are concerned.Certainly the intensity [was great] at the time of the IMF meeting,which was right in the middle of this surge. Various proposals forcoordinated intervention were explored and there was very considerableurging that we ease policy much more aggressively to deal with thisproblem. The intervention that Mr. Cross referred to was coordinatedin a rather loose way. It was a general agreement among 4 or 5central banks, anyway, that upward movements in the dollar would beresisted in our respective markets over the past week. The dollar didstay in a lower range, as Mr. Cross indicated, but when it went updecidedly we had really rather modest intervention. There weren't allthat many strong movements in the New York market but there was[unintelligible] intervention on some scale abroad occasionally whenthe dollar was strong, and that was all agreed to last week.MR. PARTEE. We intervened in a rising market? Is thatright?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In a rising market. The words you used,Mr. Cross, were "a pronounced rising market."10/2/84MR. PARTEE. We don't attempt to create disorderly conditionsthe way the Germans did.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. They jumped on the declining dollar.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We deliberately didn't do that. I thinkit may have been helpful that they did it, but I don't particularlywant to be in the posture of doing it.MR. PARTEE. I wouldn't want to be a party to it. I wouldlike to have the opportunity to register myself against such anoperation.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we haven't done it at this point andI have no present intention to do it. We weren't very aggressive,that's for sure. But we need to ratify the transactions if there areno other questions.MR. MARTIN. Move ratification.[SPEAKER(?). Second.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Sternlight.MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix.]MR. BLACK. Peter, do you think that it would work a littlebetter if we used only adjustment borrowing for our borrowing targetsand eliminated seasonal borrowing?MR. STERNLIGHT. I don't know that it would. It could havesome different effects. Our experience is that seasonal borrowingdoes seem to respond to interest rate pressures, and I think that'sthe logic for coupling it with adjustment borrowing. On the otherside, it doesn't have the same pressure to repay quickly thatadjustment borrowing has and that's the logic on the other side of it.MR. BLACK. You'd come out on balance for leaving it?MR. STERNLIGHT. I'd tend to leave it alone, I think.MR. BLACK. In the recent period, adjustment borrowing wouldhave given you a better idea of what the federal funds rate was goingto do, wouldn't it?MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, if we had done that in the recentperiod, I think it would have tended to push rates higher than theywent because we had the seasonal component building up.MR. BLACK. I was thinking you would have cut the adjustment[borrowing assumption].MR. STERNLIGHT. If we make the suitable adjustments in theborrowing level, which work into the path, we could work with eitherof those. However, the Committee may not want to do that [kind of]short-run adjusting. I tend to think of the combined total as abetter number to work with, but I think it can be argued either way.10/2/84MR. PARTEE. It is sensitive to interest rates? Is thatright?MR. STERNLIGHT. Adjustment borrowing?MR. PARTEE. I mean the seasonal.MR. STERNLIGHT. The seasonal, yes.MR. BLACK. I would have thought that it was so much lesssensitive that the other conceivably might work better. If you thinkthe federal funds rate--MR. AXILROD. President Black, we have done some empiricalwork, and it doesn't seem to show much difference between the two.And I think as Peter mentioned, in the jargon it is essentially an"intercept" problem. You would have a lower level of borrowing onaverage for whatever funds rate you would be thinking of. As far asthe volatility in the relationship, day-to-day, between borrowing andthe funds rate, I don't think it makes one iota of difference.MR. CORRIGAN. Peter, do you think there still is aprecautionary premium affecting the federal funds rate right now?MR. STERNLIGHT. I'm hard put to say what there is right nowbecause after that funds rate [unintelligible] did give some ground,and one could say that there has been evidence just in the last fewdays of some lessened reluctance to use the window. We've had severalsizable banks come in early in the reserve period. On the other hand,the funds rate has been back toward the high side in this currentweek. It is averaging about 11.21 percent so far in this statementperiod, which suggests that maybe this is just statement-datepressure--that would be my guess as of the moment--and that there issome return toward normalcy underlying this. But I would have to seeanother several days before I could conclude that with greaterconviction.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it is a very strange period. Everyindicator ordinarily would be associated with lower interest rates:The money supply was very sluggish; every bit of business news, Ithink, came in on the lower side of market expectations; and there wasgrowing evidence of lower reserve pressures. We were in the marketevery day and the market just didn't react in any consistent way. Andnow, after all this, the federal funds rate goes up where it wasbefore, with fewer reserve pressures.MR. PARTEE. We could very well be having that statement-dateeffect, couldn't we, Paul? As I recall, looking back, we've had thatrather regularly now over the last couple of years.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a funny statement-date effect, comingafter the statement date.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We keep talking about the banks beingreluctant to borrow, and many of the banks talk about the Fed havingtightened its administration of the discount window. I've had thatsaid to me time and time again even though I know that our discountofficers deny that. But I don't know why there is such a strong10/2/84impression of that around--or there was during this period of time.The fed funds rate was higher than what one would have expected.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That was back during the summer when wehad all that other stuff. What I don't understand is this last month.It's the same phenomenon in the exchange market. The same thing iskeeping the exchange market higher. It's a refusal to believe that[the numbers are] right--that the economy is slowing and that themoney supply has weakened. It has been [that way] in the last twoweeks.MR. CORRIGAN. It doesn't work for the exchange rate, but Ikeep coming away with the feeling that the only plausible explanationin terms of the domestic market is that perhaps way beneath thesurface this precautionary [motive] is still quite operative. It'sthe only thing I can figure out.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But that doesn't explain why. Youare talking about caution [by banks] about borrowing because theymight get contaminated.MR. CORRIGAN. No, not so much on borrowing but that there isjust a much more conservative attitude on the part of medium and largesize banks in terms on their whole approach to funding and moneymanagement, with some implication, obviously, for their willingness toborrow. But I don't know. It's the only thing that makes any senseto me.MR. MARTIN. To those bankers who are aware of the wildnessand the degeneration in the financial position of the thrift industryin their state and their region and their market area, that surely isa factor because it is degenerating rather rapidly.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But if that's the explanation, thenwe should be in the beginnings of a reversal of that because all theanecdotal reports as well as the reduction in the spread between CDsand Treasury bills show that there has been less anxiety in thebanking system and in the markets generally in the last few days. Inthat case, if we were to continue, let's say, $750 million borrowing,we might end up with a much lower fed funds rate than one would expectat the present time.MR. PARTEE. I think there is less anxiety about the bankingsystem. I think what Pres was talking about is more anxiety by thebankers about their own situations.MR. MARTIN. In fact, they are aware that dozens of the S&Lsin their districts are going to fail and fail with a great publicsplash. And they are aware, if they are operating nationally, thathundreds of them are going to fail. I can see that in the bankers'psychology.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Except that we have gotten reports inthe last few days that show so much more relaxation on the part ofbank management, particularly now that they feel that interest ratesare not going to go up. All I'm saying is: If that's theexplanation, then there are [unintelligible] conditions that willreverse that.10/2/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There may be some developments in comingdays that will increase the anxiety.MR. MARTIN. Exactly. They will definitely increase their--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Another major bank has to show a bigloss or something.MR. MARTIN. I'm not talking about a bank. I'm talking aboutthrift institutions. Some of them are in your backyard, good sir.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm talking about banks.MR. MARTIN. All right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just read the newspapers. A lot of thismay be the commentaries of all these people who make the newspaperevery day. They are always predicting every day that interest ratesare going to go up. And I think that must be--MR. BOEHNE. Well, there still is burned very deeply in theminds of people in the country--not just people who watch thefinancial markets every minute and every hour--the very high interestrates of several years ago when we had a 20 to 21 percent prime rate.The burn scar from that is still very obvious. And the most frequentquestion that I get when I'm out just talking to people who arerunning small and middle sized businesses is: We're not going to have18 and 19 percent prime rates anymore are we?MR. PARTEE. What do you say?MR. BOEHNE. It depends on how [unintelligible] interestrates. But the pain of that is still very close to the surface in alot of peoples' minds.MR. ROBERTS. I hear a lot of talk from the smaller andmedium size banks about how they are more carefully limiting their fedfunds sales. Is there possibly a net shrinkage in the market here?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know whether statistically itshows up as any net shrinkage, but I hear that too. They may put lessor are prepared to put less with individual institutions.MR. ROBERTS. They are certainly more selective. Maybe theydistribute it out [more].MR. RICE. Shouldn't that show up in much higher excessreserves?MR. STERNLIGHT. The nationwide total for excess has not goneup, unless it's changing this very reserve period we're in. In thefull reserve periods that we have had, that had not shown any more--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Peter, you told me that there was atendency in the beginning of these periods for excess reserves to besomewhat higher.10/2/84MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes, a tendency within the period for moreconservative management but nothing for the period as a whole.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I guess we'll turn to the businesspicture, which is crystal clear! We have to approve the operations.MR. MARTIN. Move approval.[SPEAKER(?). Second.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Kichline.MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me raise a question about your initialcomment to the effect that no decline or stagnation is ahead.MR. KICHLINE. I think I said "appears" or "the staffbelieves."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. That's what I want to raise thequestion about. You said that things came in a little less strongly--or weaker or whatever adjective you used--than you had expected lasttime. That was only about 6 weeks ago and you were assuming that GNPwas going to rise 5 percent in the third quarter. Now you're down to2.7 percent. That's a heck of a big difference in six weeks, whichreflects the fact that all the news coming in has been veryappreciably lower than you were assuming.MR. KICHLINE. Yes. I would say two things were going on,though. One is that the information that we had at the time of theAugust meeting generally is weaker today with data revisions. When wehad the August meeting, retail sales in July were reported to be down0.9 percent. With the revised data, they are now reported to be down2 percent. So, it is true that new information available for Augusthas been weaker, but I'd say the past also looks weaker forconsumption, residential construction, business-fixed investment, aswell as for the merchandise trade area. It has been very broadlybased. I think my briefing did not avoid the issue.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm just raising a question. You areamplifying what I am saying. The statistics are quite a lot weakerthan you anticipated six weeks ago. We started the summer on a highnote and we surely ended it on a low note. GNP couldn't be muchhigher in September than it was in June. It may be lower. I don'tknow. As we look ahead, it is very hard to see housing goinganyplace; and you say housing sales have leveled off. There was somefigure released this morning that I was told last night would show apretty sharp decline.MR. KICHLINE. I just received it. The house sales data wererevised down for July, and August looks quite a bit weaker.MR. PARTEE. I should remark that the revisions are aninsider's leading indicator. If revisions are downward, thatindicates weakness.10/2/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we've had a lot of downwardrevisions. It's very hard to see housing going anyplace. I wouldthink an optimistic projection in the near term is stability. Plantand equipment orders have been down quite sharply over the last fewmonths. Backlogs are obviously up from where they were in therecession, but expenditures are not that much lower than orders atthis point. In fact, they are very close, and orders most recentlyhave been weak.MR. MARTIN. We had the McGraw-Hill survey, too.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I didn't see that.MR. KICHLINE. It's dated as of yesterday. They aretabulating the October survey. The first reading for 1985 will beavailable late in October. They have a little under half of therespondents in and the total is running around an 8 percent increasein nominal terms, which is substantially weaker than the staffforecast. The survey is [still] fragmentary; we don't know how tomake a lot of sense out of it, but it is indeed a weak number.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is all accompanied by a great surgein imports, which certainly is eating into U.S. production. Thehowever many percent increase in the exchange rate recently can't helpthat situation in the future; there was an enormous surge in theexchange rate. I don't know what consumption is going to do but itwasn't very good over the summer. The auto sales look all right. Butthat's the only thing that looks pretty good. All of these otherthings raise some question about the vulnerability of inventories inthe sense of continuing large accumulation, which is the only thinggoing on now. So, why can't you make a pretty good case for no growthin the fourth quarter?MR. GRAMLEY. How many times in the past have we seen periodsof economic expansion interrupted by a quarter of pause and then itgoes on? I would bet that over the postwar period you could find tenof those.MR. MORRIS. I think the pauses typically come about twoyears after the beginning of an expansion. We normally go into alittle slowing period.MR. WALLICH. I find it hard to believe that with this budgetdeficit--even though we have very large negative net exports--we couldhave the economy sagging. There is just so much purchasing power putin. There's also the stimulation of [business] investment, whichsurely dominates housing. It's about 3 times as big as housing. So,as I look at the underlying factors, it seems to me it's a picture ofcontinued [unintelligible] pressure--not certainly strength.MR. RICE. We're talking about the fourth quarter and thiswould be a quarter of pause and it could be a big pause.MR. WALLICH. Well, that I could see. The things I'm talkingabout don't point to any particular quarter, but I do try to look alittle further ahead and ask myself: Where are we going?-10-10/2/84MR. GRAMLEY. Jim, have you looked at previous cycles to seewhether--MR. KICHLINE. There are many. A classic case is 1976 wherewe had a slowdown, particularly in consumer spending, and it looked atthe time as if the economy were perhaps falling apart. But it wasreally just one of these pauses that subsequently led to very sharpgrowth. I have an answer to your question from the model. We haveall sorts of things in the model, and the probability of negative GNPgrowth occurring in the fourth quarter of 1984 according to theBoard's econometric model is 25 percent.MR. PARTEE. It's what?MR. KICHLINE. It is 25 percent. That probability has beenrising because of the factors you've been citing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. I wonder if we have an example here of centralbankers finding something going along about the way it ought to begoing along and finding a whole lot to worry about. It seems to methat several months ago we were concerned about the economyoverheating. We were going along well into a recovery and the concernwas that we were going to go off the ledge and that it wasn'tsustainable. We get some slowing over a period of several months andnow some concern about a recession. It seems to me that what ishappening is exactly what a majority of the Committee wanted to happenjust a few months ago--that we are seeing this adjustment to a slowereconomy. My own region happens to be a region that's fairly sensitiveto what is going on in the [overall] economy and historically it hastended to come down earlier than some other regions. I must say as Italk with people in various sectors that the evidence suggests someslowing [in the expansion] but there's not very much that wouldsuggest that we're heading into a slide. There is less strength inmanufacturing but the retailers report that things are going alongreally rather well. We've had some weakness in tourism largelybecause of the dollar and the fact that Canadians are not coming intothe District. There is weakness in residential housing but commercialconstruction is going along reasonably well. The bankers report someslowing in C&I loans but not as a forerunner of a recession.So, where I come out is that the economy is doing exactlywhat we wanted it to do. We wanted [the expansion] to slow down someso that we could have a more sustainable growth. It seems to me thatwe are not as recession prone as I would have thought at this point inthe recovery. I think inflation is under much better control and Ithink monetary policy has been conducted on a better basis this timearound. We tightened earlier in a recovery than any time I recallsince being in this room and I think we have begun to ease earlierthan we normally have; so I think policy is considerably less pro-cyclical than it has been historically. I would come out thinkingthat what has been happening is pretty good for the economy.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Rice.MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, the staff's revisions to theforecast for 1985 seem to be more than usually sensitive to the dollar-11-10/2/84exchange rate. We know what the various possibilities are there andwe also know the difficulty of assessing the probabilities associatedwith forecasting the exchange rate. But I don't think many peoplewould argue that the basic long-run strength in the economy is beingthreatened. I don't know of many people who have forecast a recessionin 1985. I think the central question for us right now is: What isgoing to happen in the current quarter and possibly the next quarter?The question is whether the economy is going to continue to deceleratebelow the current level of activity estimated for the third quarter orwhether it's going to stabilize at levels around those of the thirdquarter or whether it's going to rebound as projected by the staff. Ithink the scenario outlined by the staff for the fourth quarter is avery plausible one and I certainly hope that it is realized. If it isrealized, we'll have pretty much what Ed Boehne was hoping for--thatis, we will have the kind of situation that we want.However, I think we have to recognize and pay some attentionto the kinds of factors that the Chairman pointed to just a momentago: that there is evidence of considerable weakness and that thestaff forecast is based on pretty wobbly foundations--primarilyconsumer behavior and the expected rebound in consumer spending. Now,at a time when investment spending is also decelerating somewhat, thisrebound in the current quarter seems to me crucially [dependent] on asubstantial rebound in consumer spending. And from past experience, Ithink we have found that predicting consumer behavior in the short runon a quarterly basis is a very hazardous business. In other words, itseems to me highly possible that, in light of the very rapiddeceleration that we've seen in the last quarter, this could carryforward to very low levels of expansion. I would expect positiverates of growth, but conceivably fairly low rates of growth--marginally positive rates of growth--and that, in my judgment, wouldnot be a desirable outcome. And I think we have an opportunity now toforestall that without any risk of threatening a sustainableexpansion.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.MR. MARTIN. I appreciated Jim's comment on the 25 percentprobability from the model of zero growth in the fourth quarter.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Minus.MR. KICHLINE. Zero or negative.MR. MARTIN. It seems to me that when we refer to theslowdown in growth we're talking about a change from 10.1 percent realGNP growth in the first quarter to 2.7 percent in the third quarter.I suppose that's a slowdown rather than a jamming on the brakes, butit is reasonably significant. Henry's point is well placed withregard to consumer behavior and the probability of the consumer comingback, particularly in the durables area. The other side of that coinis the consumer coming back to a saving rate that might reflect thenews that I expect to occur with regard to failing thrift institutionsand commercial banks as the year wears on. [When] the November 14report of Financial Corporation of America comes upon the media andother institutions show difficulties, it could even be that theconsumer will feel that saving may be a little more desirable. Idon't know what the probability of that is but there is some10/2/84probability. Of course, then the question is raised as to saving intowhat. As to the notion of a return in the nondefense capital goodsarea to a much stronger rate of spending, I think there is a greatdeal of uncertainty there and that uncertainty stems from the verypoint that the Chairman underlined previously, which is that interestrates are still relatively high and profit margins, due to foreigncompetition, are the narrowest in many, many industrial categoriesthat they have been in several decades. And that certainly tends toweigh a bit upon a board of directors realizing that because of thefinancing gap they have to go outside. They can't do as they did inthe earlier stages of the expansion and finance from internal sources.So, it seems to me, though I don't know what the probabilityis, that there is a risk--not the risk that we will have such a badfourth quarter or first or second quarter going forward, but the riskof an earlier end to this expansion than would be desirableconsidering the need to face fiscal policy decisions in '85. Andthose are decisions that can best be made in [an environment] of atrend rate of real growth or even a 3 to 4 percent rate of growthrather than an expectation that the recession is around the cornerand, therefore, it's too late to do anything in the fiscal policyarea. I reiterate my concern about financial institutions and theirlack of financial soundness and the vulnerability that the expansionhas to the fact that this will be developing later this year and intonext year. So, it seems to me that the Chairman needs to haveflexibility and that we need to build into our thinking quite a bit offlexibility so that we can move, particularly to offset downwardpressures, in the short- or intermediate-term future.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Miss Seger.MS. SEGER. As someone who was pessimistic rather early on, Iguess I'm pleased to see the statistics finally supporting my woman'sintuition in that the statistics across the board are certainlylooking much weaker than they did back in July when I arrived here.I'm also viewing this as a good sign, as are people in Philadelphia,and not a bad sign. I think it's healthy that we are looking at somedownward revisions in our forecast for the rest of this year and for1985 because it's important to keep inflation under control and havingthese signs takes some of the heat off here to jam on the brakes. So,I'm pleased to see that this is happening. Also, I'm optimistic--maybe more optimistic than most people here--about some of thefundamental changes going on in the economy. I have mentioned thesebefore, particularly those things that are influencing productivityfavorably. There are other [developments] that influence themanagement of companies and increase their commitment to doing thingsefficiently, which of course is tied in to productivity. Theirstronger moves in labor negotiations, some innovations, and moreemphasis on R&D are the kinds of things that I think will pay bigrewards longer term. I'm also concerned, though, about the problemsof the thrifts. Maybe it's because I just gave a talk a week ago tosome treasurers of savings and loans and I'm carrying those cards, butthere are big problems there. There are big problems there even ifinterest rates don't rise, but the numbers I heard with even a modestincrease in interest rates in the future are terribly scary. I thinka very large group will be going down the chute rather than a somewhatsmaller group. So, those are my concerns. But, as I said, overallI'm rather pleased with what is going on.-13-10/2/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I too am rather pleased aboutthe ways things have gone. I don't really see the risks being on thedown side either for the fourth quarter or for 1985. I was a littlesurprised at the 2.7 percent staff projection. I would have thoughtit would be a little higher. I think the Commerce flash report of 3.6percent is probably closer to the mark and, in fact, market watchersare expecting that to be revised upward somewhat. Also, the numbersthat I've seen for September, in my District at least, are indicatingsome rebound in the economy from the slowing in the summer.Speaking specifically about my District, we are seeing theslowdown, but in all areas the strengths are still outweighing theweaknesses in the economy. So, I would think, Mr. Chairman, that therisk is that we will have a rebound in the fourth quarter and thatthat will carry over into 1985. I say risk not because I think it'sgoing to be terribly significant but because the numbers will probablybe lower. But I certainly don't see any negative growth or even zerogrowth in 1985. I think the institutional problems certainly willhave an effect on consumer attitudes and consumer expectations but, atthe moment at least, I sense a less nervous attitude on the part ofpeople with respect to the banking system. I don't think the thriftproblems have really surfaced very well in peoples' consciousness.Now, if FCA or some other thrift were to go belly up, we might have adifferent situation. But, for the moment at least, I think the marketnervousness and consumer nervousness about the banking system hasabated to some extent.Basically, as I look at the situation, I think we are in apause. I expect the fourth quarter to come in a little better thanthe staff has projected and, as I said earlier, I think that willcarry over into 1985. The wild card in all of this is the question ofthe dollar. And I would just like to raise at this point--if it'sappropriate, Mr. Chairman--the question of how significant in ourdiscussions today the question of the dollar should be. Perhaps wecan talk about this later, but I wonder with respect to the dollarwhat might happen if this significant decline in the dollar [were tooccur] whether this situation should be reflected in some way in thedirective. I just throw that out as a point of discussion. Whathappens to the dollar can obviously affect these projections very,very significantly. If anything were to happen soon in terms of amarked change in the dollar, it could affect what happens in thefourth quarter or certainly in 1985. But with the exception of thedollar consideration, I would think the economy is on a pretty goodtrack and I would be more concerned about inflation in 1985 ratherthan slow growth.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You refer to evidence of a rebound in yourDistrict in September. What is that evidence?MR. FORRESTAL. Well, retail sales have come back in earlySeptember. Housing is back a bit more. It is still down from earlierlevels, but better than the July numbers had suggested. Consumerspending generally is a little better.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know. I heard a lot ofstories about retail sales improving late in August and in early-14-10/2/84September. More recently I hear stories that they disappeared again.I don't know whether--MR. ROBERTS. That's what I am hearing also--that they havebecome sluggish again after a little pickup in late August and earlySeptember.MR. MARTIN. They could come back, [given] the discountingtechniques to move the merchandise. I've heard [that their approachis]: Never mind what the price is; [unintelligible]; let's dosomething else here to move the merchandise.MR. FORRESTAL. One of the interesting things that I find isthat the retail sales reflected in the statistics are not borne out bythe retailers that I talk to. We see evidence in the numbers ofrelatively weak retail sales, for example, yet when I talk to variousretailers they say they are doing great. There is some discrepancy.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You must have been talking to differentones than I was talking to or I wouldn't have [unintelligible].MR. PARTEE. Well, that's one thing about retailers: You canalways find a retailer to support your position!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.MR. BOYKIN. In the Eleventh District, Mr. Chairman, we areseeing some slowdown. Primarily what we see is a climate of weaknessin the energy industry, particularly the processing portion. Refiningand [unintelligible] actually are showing absolute declines both inemployment and production. This summer drilling also declined on ayear-over-year basis, although very recently there has been a littlepickup there. Housing is ebbing. Non-residential construction isflattening out, and I really don't think that's too bad down our way.We do have a number of areas of strengths. On unemployment, ofcourse, we're below the national average, which really still suggeststo us a fairly tight labor market. This is borne out at our own Bankwhere we continue to see our turnover rate increasing. It's alwaysfairly large, but it is picking up again. The excessive inventoriesin oil field equipment are being worked off and production andemployment as a matter of fact are beginning to increase there.Defense contracting is helpful as is electronic equipment. In retailsales, we continue to make gains but anecdotally some retailers wetalk to seem a bit pessimistic. The toldme that they were getting increases of 17 and 18 percent and now itlooks like 7 or 8 percent and he's not too sure what will occur as wego through the year. On the agricultural side in our District, whileprices aren't that good, increased production has pretty well offsetthat. At least for this year, we think the District agriculturalsituation is not going to be all that bad overall, although it's notuniform. The drought areas, of course, are severely hurt. My bottomline is that this seems to me more of a pause right now, and I agreewith those who think that maybe that's not too bad a development. Iwould anticipate that the fourth quarter might be a little better andthat 1985--barring all these really terrible things that have beenmentioned--shouldn't be all that bad.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.-15-10/2/84MR. KEEHN. Well, in the words of one of my associates: "TheMiddle West has dropped out of the economic expansion." But as I hearthe comments, maybe we aren't the only ones to have dropped out. Ithink it's now clear that overall economic activity in the Middle Westhas been at least leveling off since the early part of the summer.Steel production is down and down significantly. Imports are taking avery much larger part of that market. The heavy capital goods sectorcontinues to be relatively weak. One part of that sector, indeed, hasturned around: Orders for large trucks, which had been very strong,have now turned around and are on the way down. Residentialconstruction is down, the result of high interest rates. Our gains inemployment rates have slowed down. Our unemployment rate is down, butit's probably more a factor of people just dropping out of the workforce and not the result of higher employment numbers. Retail salesare uneven. There was a pickup during the back-to-school period.Nonetheless, the September numbers, according to what we're hearing,are again on the soft side. In the agricultural sector, the outlookcontinues to be relatively poor and the land values are continuing togo down. The outlook for farm incomes is not positive and that isbacked up even more in the farm equipment sector where production isbeing further curtailed. Some major manufacturers are continuing tolay off workers. Broadly, the news is a bit more modest. I would notsuggest by any of this that we are heading back into a recession. Ithink it would be far too early to suggest that. But certainly, atleast in our area, the expansion has faded. And I think we are goingto have to watch the numbers pretty carefully in the upcoming period.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. In general, Mr. Chairman, I have a lot ofsympathy for what Mr. Boehne said. At the same time, there is noquestion that the tone of things has changed. From my ownperspective, two months ago I would have put about a zero probabilityon a fourth quarter of zero or something worse than that. I'm notsure where my own mental calculus would take me right now--maybe tothe 25 percent the model has, or maybe a little less than that. But Istill think the best bet, by a comfortable margin, is that we will seea pattern of economic growth emerge in the fourth quarter and in early1985 along the broad lines suggested in the staff forecast. Havingsaid that, there is no question that right now it's darn hard to readthrough the numbers. Clearly, for example, the way that imports areworking their way into the economy is just off the charts in terms ofour appreciation of what it means for domestic income, employment, andall the rest of it. On the other side, it's awfully hard to know whatthe underlying demand for automobiles is. We get reports through ourdirectors and otherwise suggesting that the supply constraints in theautomobile industry are very real and that the cars that people wantsimply are not available. The inventory situation is a very, verytough call. It could go either way. Again, the general attitude weseem to run into everyplace among business people is that they arebeing very aggressive and they are not terribly uncomfortable withtheir inventory situations even right now. On the housing sector, Ithink the general view that it's going to stand still is probablyright. But there's one potential little problem there. I get thesense that these adjustable rate mortgages that were put out in suchenormous quantities earlier in the year and late last year could be apotential problem in their own right that could possibly have someunsettling influences on the mortgage market, leaving aside the-16-10/2/84problems of the thrifts. The inflation outlook, I think, is clearly aplus, both in terms of attitudes and psychology as well as reality.While we may be a little surprised by the business numbers, in someway the biggest surprise is the continued very, very satisfactoryshowing on the inflation side, which is reflected in recent [wage]settlements as well.Just a word on the agricultural situation: The credit sideis no better than it was in May; it's probably worse notwithstandingthe fact that production yields are going to be pretty good. Onbalance, I think the credit side is probably worse. But all in all,as I said, I think the best bet by a comfortable margin is a reboundalong the lines of the staff forecast. The biggest wild card by faris the financial situation, despite the progress that was made withsome of the LDC debt problems and so forth. I think the real wildcard is the possibility of some more uncertainties or unsettlingevents in the financial situation quickly spilling over into aquestion of confidence about dollar-denominated assets in general. Itcould have very adverse implications for the dollar. That would bethe worst of all worlds.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. I want to agree strongly with Ed Boehne. Infact, I would underline his comments by saying "Thank goodness we havehad a slowdown," because throughout 1983 the expansion was more rapidthan we expected. We certainly didn't have in mind anything like that10 percent increase for the first quarter; that was several percentagepoints above what we expected. The second quarter was alsoconsiderably stronger than originally forecast and than what wethought appropriate. Finally we have gotten a quarter on the lowside. It's the first quarter I can remember in the recovery that's onthe low side of the projection and it's about time that we start tosee some balance. Somebody earlier was talking about putting somerisks back into the situation. Well, I think that's necessary for thebusiness situation as well as the foreign exchange value of the dollar--that there be a two-sided view as to what may be occurring. I'minclined to think that this is temporary. Despite Emmett's commentsthat consumer spending is variable in the short run, I would say thatthere tends to be an equating of spending with income streams, andincome streams are still good. So, the chances are very, very strongthat there will be a recovery in consumer spending in the fourthquarter. Whether it will be as strong as the staff has projected, Idon't know, but I would say the chances are good that there will be alarger increase in GNP in the fourth quarter than in the third.I'm a little more concerned about 1985. I noticedparticularly the tremendous rate of increase in imports, and I thinkthat is beginning to sap the economy. If that continues in 1985--which, incidentally, the projection doesn't forecast--we could get aconsiderably weaker year than has been forecast from the standpoint ofdomestic activity. But that's some time in the future and a lot willdepend on the value of the dollar. And who knows what that may be?Just to take a figure, it may be 40 percent lower by the first of theyear. Who can say where the dollar will be? I do think that ourgreatest threat, looking ahead over the next couple of years, is thepossibility that we may find ourselves in a position where interestrates have to be substantially higher than they are now. And that's-17-10/2/84because of the thrifts, Martha, and the farmers, Jerry, and the smallbusinessmen who have been referred to, and the LDCs, and the conditionof financial institutions generally. A repetition of the 18 percentrate level that we saw before would be very, very destructive on theeconomy. As I see it, that need may still develop in the course ofthis cycle as we get farther out, and it's very important to try tokeep the pressure off so that won't occur. That's the big thing wehave to watch out for, and that's why I say "Thank goodness for theslowdown!"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.MR. WALLICH. I feel very much the same way. Of course, I amin some way impressed by the immediate events, but we can't influencethem very much. In other words, what we do now is not going to haveany immediate effect even on the fourth quarter except maybe forhousing. And looking at the longer run, it seems to me that inflationcontinues to be the main problem. I know it's boring to talk aboutinflation since it is finally doing so well. But really, that is tobe expected. Here we are well above the natural rate of unemploymentand inflation is going down, and that's what it's supposed to do.What puzzles me is that so many people expect rising inflation at atime when we have a very high level of unemployment. Maybe theseexpectations are [related to a view] that the dollar will go down ormaybe to the fear of financial calamities. But basically we seem tobe taking 5 percent [inflation] for granted. If it stays that way,then the problem is out of the way. I think we're living on borrowedtime here with respect to the dollar. We don't know when it will comedown. It's very unlikely to me that it will always stay at theselevels. We have had remarkable wage moderation; it's hard to explain.Most expectations were for very high settlements, and surely thatunderlying feeling of "restore and more" must still be there. I amgrateful to have had such good settlements. If you look at our moneysupply target, we have pulled that down on average 1/4 or 1/2 point atmost for 1985. Nominal GNP is likely to go from about 10 percentgrowth to about 7.5 percent. So, if this change in the relationshipof money to nominal GNP isn't going into output, maybe it will go intoslower velocity but maybe it will go into higher prices. At least themakings of that are there. As I look at the outlook, I look more atmid-1985 and later in 1985 than at the fourth quarter [of 1984]. Ithink there's enough reason to believe that the fourth quarter isn't acause for immediate alarm and to allow one to take this longer-runview. Thank you.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I came into this meeting feelingvery optimistic because we've been able to move the economy to aslower growth mode without pushing interest rates higher than we did.I was afraid a few months ago; I didn't know what level of the fundsrate would be required to slow down the economy. I have no concernabout a prolonged period of stagnation, much less a recession, simplybecause I think the fundamental underpinnings to the economy arestrong and I think the economy would be very responsive to even amodest downward movement in interest rates, which any prolongedstagnation would tend to generate. The main thing I've been concernedabout in the near term is the foreign exchange market because it seemsto me that there is a speculative bubble in that market. It's just-18-10/2/84like the tulip bulb mania. Whenever you see a market defying all thefundamentals, which it is doing now, you have to think the time isapproaching when a correction has to be made. And, obviously, I'mconcerned about the interest rate effects of a decline in the dollar.So, I think it is very fortunate that if the dollar should startdeclining fairly soon, it will do so in an economy that is movingahead at a more reduced rate and the strains on the financial marketswill not be as great as they otherwise would. I see that as our majorproblem coming up--how we respond in policy to the financial strainscaused by a weaker dollar.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's what we all have been saying for ayear or more. Governor Gramley.MR. GRAMLEY. I'm very much in the Ed Boehne/Chuck Parteecamp. I do think something rather fundamental has happened to thebasic expansion and I think we should be thankful for that. I wouldnote again that we've been through a lot of periods of economicexpansion--Jim mentioned 1976, which was one, but there have been manyothers--in which the growth of employment, industrial production, andreal GNP slowed for awhile and then picked up again. Jim was askedwhat the probability of negative GNP in the fourth quarter was and hegave the answer .25. A more meaningful question in my judgment wouldbe: What is the probability of two successive quarters of negativeGNP growth? And the answer the model cranks out on that is .05, whichis negligible. And that agrees with my own perception.MR. PARTEE. At this time? Did you have that run?MR. GRAMLEY. Yes. That's a regular output run of the modeland I get the model forecast.MR. PARTEE. One in 20?MR. GRAMLEY. Yes. If you look over the basic factors thathave been driving the economy, and many of them have been mentionedhere, they all seem to me to be conducive to continuation of economicexpansion. Budget policy is expansive. Monetary policy has not beenunduly restrictive--we're looking at a growth of real money over thefirst three quarters of around 2 percent, which is quite high byhistorical standards. Consumer confidence is high. Consumer balancesheets are in quite good shape--income ratios have gone up but tonowhere near where they once were. Net worth has improved recentlywith the pickup in stock prices. As for incentives for businessinvestment, surely we can't expect to see 20 to 25 percent rates ofreal business fixed investment taking place, but profits are high, thetax incentives are still there, and capacity utilization is up. Asfor the inventory situation, one can see problems in some areas likechemicals and fibers, textiles, and metals, but overall inventorysales ratios are quite low. My perception is the one that Jerrymentioned--that most businesses are quite comfortable with theirinventory positions. So, I think the staff has it about right. Ithink we will see a pickup in the fourth quarter, and if not then, wewill see it in the first quarter. And then if we can see growth stayin the range of 3 to 3-1/2 percent, it's certainly going to be quitebeneficial in terms of the impact on interest rates and aspects offinancial markets and the problems we have there.-19-10/2/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Focusing on ourregional economy, it's not unlike what has been described in someother areas, particularly where there is a fairly dramatic divisionbetween urban and rural areas. In the urban areas, retail sales haveleveled off; the housing starts, not unlike what has already beendescribed, are falling off somewhat. On the other hand, commercialconstruction, particularly in Omaha, Kansas City, and Oklahoma City isbooming. It started late and it will continue on for another coupleof years simply to complete the projects that are underway. In theenergy area, as Bob Boykin has indicated, there's been an uptick inrig count operations. In Oklahoma, Colorado, and Wyoming, the numbersare reasonably substantial as a matter of fact.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I thought he said the oil business wasdepressed.MR. BOYKIN. I said during the summer there was an uptick inTexas; the actual rig count was still down a little in New Mexico andparts of the country he's talking about. There have been rathersubstantial increases over the last month and we have begun to get alittle uptick even in Texas. But comparing now to a year ago, it'sstill down a little.MR. GUFFEY. I think our numbers would reflect somethingmodestly different from that; the uptick compared to a year ago wouldbe somewhat greater than Bob has just described. In auto production,they are working very near capacity on the auto assembly lines.Aircraft, on the other hand, is almost a dead industry at the moment.They can't sell aircraft, particularly business aircraft. That is oneof the things that businesses apparently defer and there's an overhangon the market of used aircraft. And that's rather an important partof our industry in the Tenth District. The agricultural scene is notunlike what already has been described. It's bad now and theprospects of it getting better any time in the near future are notbright--non-existent as a matter of fact. Russian grain sales aretaking place now, but they're taking place in [the context of] aninventory overhang and as a result the prices do not reflect it nordoes it pass through to the producer. And that, of course, has acontinued impact on the financial side; the agricultural banks aresort of hanging on. The question is what they will do with collateralthat supports those loans when the loans cannot be serviced--interestcannot be paid. As a result the best estimate is that if there is abottom to be reached, it won't be reached until perhaps the firstquarter of 1985. The question of what will happen from now to then isuncertain. But I think it should be important to this Committee tounderstand that unless we have a dramatic decrease in interest ratesthere will not be any salvation for the agricultural sector. Thecurrent rates, or modestly lower rates, will not be an answer to thefinancial problems in the agricultural sector.With respect to the staff forecast, I would agree with EdBoehne and others who have expressed the view that we ought to behappy with the slowdown. As I look into the fourth quarter andparticularly into 1985, I have some question about the staff forecastin that I think the economy will be somewhat weaker than theyforecast. In the numbers that they used, retail sales are very-20-10/2/84important; auto sales, for example, are extremely important in 1985.The staff is looking at an 11 million unit rate for auto sales in1985. The fourth quarter of 1985, for example, is in the area of 11.2million--greater than any time in 1983. That suggests to me that ifthere is any retrenchment because of problems in the financial sectoror otherwise, that forecast is more expansive than I would feelcomfortable with. With respect to the dollar's strength, it'sanybody's guess. But as it relates to inflation it would seem to methat so long as the dollar is strong imports are strong, and we couldlook at lesser real growth and lesser inflation and, thus, theforecast for nominal GNP in the period ending in the fourth quarter of1985 would be somewhat less than the staff is projecting.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.MR. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, in the Eighth District, economicactivity is still strong--I think a little stronger than the nationalaverage--but we are clearly seeing signs of a slowdown. Buildingactivity is high but housing starts are declining. Builders arecomfortable with where they are but are worried about what will happenin the fall and generally are anticipating that the high interestrates will severely and adversely affect them. Consumer spending isstrong in our District; sales of consumer goods haven't really sloweddown. We have gotten a lot of information from national retailersthat sales, after flattening out in the summer, picked up in lateAugust or early September and, as I said, have become sluggish again.Locally, there is less of that sluggishness. Except for in thenorthern part of our District, the agricultural situation hasimproved; there is some reduction in the financial pressures that thefarmers have been feeling for the last two years.I made a comparison here of weak points and strong points andwhat I ended up with is that the same industries and the sameactivities are on both the weak and the strong side. For example, inagriculture we have a very weak situation in northern Missouri. Inthe case of soybeans, it costs more to produce them than they can besold for at the moment even though we are getting a lot of production--in the area of 50 bushels an acre. The value of the dollar is anadverse factor in exports, and cotton and rice are export crops inpart of the District. On the other hand, they have the biggestproduction in history--greater than 1982. So, how that will come outis a close call in terms of the effects on them. Construction is at ahigh level but the outlook is for a weakening. In production,generally we're at a very high level. Automobile sales arecharacterized by the major dealers as red hot. They can't handle thedemand, particularly for some of the larger cars. So, that looksgood. On the other hand, we've had some plant closings in theDistrict. International Harvester, a producer of farm implements,just closed a plant with 1500 workers; a small foundry closed; we sawthe first AT&T effect in telecommunications with a small plantclosing. In terms of the confidence factor, there is considerableconcern about the thrifts. I had an interesting coincidence of threevisits in the last two weeks by bankers who are concerned about thecondition of thrifts. Now, why they are [concerned] may be a productof industry discussions, but they foresee major failures withoutidentifying them. As I talk to the thrift people, they are concernedabout the negative interest arbitrage but they haven't seen anydeterioration in quality, including in the variable rate loans. The-21-10/2/84consumer's confidence is reflected in our District in rising consumerloans; the consumer is still borrowing. All in all, what I see is aslowing at a high level--not a lot of imbalances around that we couldreally do anything about. Agriculture is an example. There is someeffect of the high dollar, but no big inventory problems that haven'tbeen resolved. Our expectations are that nationally we'll probablysee a continuation of about 3 percent growth next year but withinflation rising, probably on the order of 5-1/2 or 6 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Horn.MS. HORN. As for business conditions in our District, theanecdotes would support an economy that is levelling off but notdeclining. And we would view that as basically a good development. Iwould like to comment on inflation. A couple of speakers havecommented on it and, in my opinion, it is an ongoing problem. Thereis, of course, a good side of this. We hear a number of anecdotes onproductivity as well in our District--that it may be increasing andthere may be some significant changes. On the negative side, leavingoff fiscal policy from the discussion and turning to the exchangerate, I think there is a genuine concern that if the exchange ratewere to be reduced significantly, that would show through to pricesvery quickly. In the Cleveland District we have a large number of thetypes of firms that are finding themselves subject to importsubstitution. And it's that pressure that has kept their margins inan area where they are just completely uncomfortable with them. Theyare just waiting for the moment to move [prices higher]. We hearmany, many stories of these types of firms being poised to move theinstant they can. So, that adds to my concern about inflation as thelonger-term problem.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody else want to comment at thispoint? Mr. Griffith, if you want to, we'll give you 30 seconds.MR. GRIFFITH. Well, I can't add anything other than to saythat we support the Ed Boehne concept. We think things are goingreally well. There's nothing wrong with sitting here right on target.Our staff forecast has, as does the Greenbook, fourth-quarter growthmore in the 4 percent range. And we're optimistic about 8 percentnominal GNP growth next year. I would only add to two things thathave been talked about earlier. In our District we also haveagricultural problems, and I concur with Roger that these problems aregoing to show up in the first quarter of '85 and later. And, ofcourse, the thrift industry problems--and it seems we must have halfof them, all arising at one time--are, as I think Jerry pointed out,in fact causing great concern in the financial community. Bankers arehuddling for strange reasons. They have strange views aboutborrowing; they have strange views about a lot of things; and they'revery nervous about the thrift industry.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe you can give us a quick recital, Mr.Axilrod, and we'll [have coffee.]MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.][Coffee break]-22-10/2/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might say that I don't have all thesefigures precisely in mind, but the latest indications on the moneysupply suggest that September is going to come in lower than wasassumed. And the quarterly figure for June to September will be inthe neighborhood of 2 percent or a little more, right?MR. AXILROD. It will be below 2-1/2 percent and could be aslow as 2 percent. The numbers are variable.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. October will start off appreciably belowthe September average. It's rather a very sluggish ending. The otherfigures for the 3 months are without any clear change.MR. PARTEE. That is, growth from June to September would be2 percent instead of 2-1/2 percent?MR. AXILROD. September could be as much as 1-1/2 pointslower than we had, so that takes off 1/2 point for the quarter.MR. PARTEE. I see.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It may be worth pointing out that reserveshave done nothing over the summer. A question was asked about thedollar earlier, and I'm not going to deal with all the questions ofwhat happens if the dollar declines because I don't know. I've beenworried about that for a year and it hasn't happened yet. Instead, ithas been going up and going up very rapidly recently, as you know.That is a factor in my thinking at least. I suggest that something isthe matter here in terms of some notion of longer-term equilibrium andis a factor in the business picture and, as I indicated earlier, asource of some alarm abroad. I certainly put that in my thinking as afactor to supply more reserves rather than less during this period.That factor alone is not the only factor, but I think at this stage itis not an insignificant one. Well, with that much introduction, whowould like to say something?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It seems to me that we ought tomaintain the present borrowing level of $750 million. I do think it'sworth commenting here, though, that I've been surprised that you havebrought borrowings down from $1 billion to $750 million without anyconsultation with the Committee. Even though I think that was thecorrect thing to do and a certain amount of discretion is indicated inthe directive, it seems to me that at some point you would want tocheck with the Committee to make sure that others share that view onhow to use that discretion. The question could arise again, possibly,over the next few weeks: If we were to start with a borrowing level,let's say, of $750 million, at what point would you feel that youshould check with the Committee if both money and the real economyturn out weaker and, therefore, you were reducing the borrowing levelor increasing the nonborrowed reserve path?Turning to the decision for today, I'd start from theassumption that even though there may be weakness in the fourthquarter, that just does not mean an incipient recession. It seems tome that we already have been perceived in the markets as being fairlyaggressive in easing and I think we ought to be somewhat cautious,particularly between now and the election period. Unless there arevery clear economic reasons to do otherwise, we ought to continue to-23-10/2/84be fairly cautious rather than move toward a pronounced easing. Asfar as the targets go, alternative B strikes me as fine. I wouldleave the funds rate range where it is. There is one last point:It's not too likely, but if we were to get a restoration of confidencein the banking system in a way whereby the management of these banksbegan to follow a somewhat less cautious policy in reserve management,then with a borrowing level of $750 million, we might find fed fundsdropping to as [low] as, say, 10-1/4 percent. And a question I thinkthe Committee ought to consider is: Do we want that much of a drop?If this contingency were to arise--though I don't think it will--wouldwe want to see that much of a drop? There could be an understandingthat the Chairman would be in touch with the rest of the Committee atthat point.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would support alternativeB with the understanding, as during the last period, that theborrowing limit could be lowered if the aggregates come in extremelyweak. But I think an 8 to 12 percent fed funds range is no longerappropriate. When interest rates were moving up, the lower end of thefunds range didn't have much relevance. When they start moving down,then it seems to me the lower limit becomes the more relevant one.And to me an 8 percent lower limit is simply too low, certainly atthis juncture. I would hate to see us make the sort of mistake we didin 1981 of pursuing vigorously an M1 that was showing some weaknessand pushing rates down and getting an enormous surge of response fromthe economy again. I think that would be very unfortunate. It seemsto me that we need to probe down on interest rates and not let themmove down too sharply.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What are you referring to in 1981?MR. MORRIS. Well, in '81--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In '80 when we had an 18-1/2 percentfunds rate in June.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That was an entirely different situation.A drop in the economy and the money supply decreased [unintelligible].It was a mistake in retrospect, but I don't think we have anythinglike that now.MR. MORRIS. The context is different. What I'm trying tosay is that I don't think in the present context we ought tovigorously pursue a sluggish M1 if it means pushing interest ratesdown very sharply. And, therefore, I think it would be a mistake tohave the directive give the Manager leeway to move interest rates downthat far. I would suggest a 10 to 12 percent range on the funds rateas being much more realistic, and that would require the Committee tomake another formal judgment before we went below ten percent.MR. RICE. I would just like to point out that evenalternative A contemplates a funds rate no lower than 10-1/4 percent.MR. PARTEE. Well, assuming that the aggregates come in thatway.-24-10/2/84MR. MORRIS. It just seems rather silly to me in thissituation to have a number as low as 8 percent when the lower limit isthe relevant one.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say 8 percent. This is a piece of theframework that I hadn't even considered--that the funds rate might bedown around 8 percent.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Or even 10 percent. I would haveproblems with 10 percent in the next few weeks. I assume you would.MR. MORRIS. I'm not sure I would have a problem with 10percent, but certainly anything below 10 percent I think would be alittle precipitous right now.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a question of what kind of signals wewant to give. After all, we're very close to the 12 percent and we'renowhere near the 8 percent at this point. Governor Martin.MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I think that the growth in M1 andthe growth in M2 over the last 4 months or so deserve some underlininghere. The lack of growth in the monetary aggregates and the flatconfiguration of the curve of reserve growth argue, as one of ourcolleagues here indicated, for probing in the direction of restoringM1 and M2 to a somewhat higher configuration over the next weeks. Italso seems to me that the slowing of the economy's rate of growth andthe uncertainty with regard to nondefense capital spending suggest aprobing in that direction. I would join Governor Gramley in hisassertion that a 25 percent annual rate of growth of capital spendingis not appropriate at this stage of the cycle, but I would also pointout that we've had some minus figures in the nondefense capital areafor two months and that the purchasing agents indicate strongly thatthis continued for a third month in September. I'm not sanguine thatthe consumers are going to come back that quickly. On top of therationale stemming from the aggregates and from the reserve growthpattern you add the high uncertainties with regard to a possiblegrowth recession--whatever that is--in the fourth quarter or the firstquarter or both. We can certainly have two quarters of very, very lowgrowth with the implication that says to the Congress when they comeback--after all, we're talking about policies that will have someimpact four or six or eight months from now just at the time when theCongress is back--and the question of taking some responsibility forfiscal policy is in the offing. If we have 1 or 2 percent real growthat that time, what prospect is there for some degree of responsibilityfor fiscal policy?And finally, it seems to me that the behavior pattern thatSteve described with regard to borrowing, with regard to fed fundsprovision, and with regard to excess reserve positions on the part ofthe banking community will probably be reinforced. This aberrantbehavior, if you will, that has kept the fed funds rate where it isdespite almost daily intervention by us, despite the reserve position,and the borrowing position of the banking community, is going to bereinforced by the bad news that's going to come out of commercialbanks and thrift institutions instance after instance. And we knowthis bad news is coming and that it is certainly not going to buildconfidence. It seems to me we should probe from the current level of$750 million of borrowing, from the current 11 to 11-1/2 percent level-25-10/2/84of fed funds, and from the current level of excess reserves carefullydown toward the levels specified in "A." In other words, I recommendwe start at the current levels and move very carefully toward "A,"consulting as you will with this Committee, Mr. Chairman. But,certainly, a $600 million level of borrowing is not out of thequestion; and if it takes a $500 million level of borrowing to get tothat 10 to 10-1/2 percent range for fed funds, then so be it. A thirdreason for probing and moving in that direction is, of course, thedollar situation, which has been thoroughly discussed here and whichis giving our central banker colleagues in Europe and Japandifficulties. To me, the aggregates, the economy, and the dollarargue for a careful probing movement in the direction of whatever ittakes to bring the rate down in the direction of the level specifiedin "A."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But not necessarily the money supplynumbers specified?MR. MARTIN. But not necessarily the money supply.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tony Solomon hasstated a position that I would like to join, with just a modest changefor maybe different reasons. Rather than adopting "B" as proposed inthe Bluebook at a 6 percent M1 level--and I'm not talking about eitherM2 or M3 or the federal funds range--I would prefer that the Committeeadopt a shading toward "C," to the 5-1/2 percent level, the same levelwe adopted for the third quarter. In other words, as the record ispublished it would reflect that there has been no change in theobjective of the Committee with respect to money growth. Thedifference, obviously, is that we did not achieve 5-1/2 percent growthin the third quarter, but only 2 percent on a quarterly basis. Itwould give us the latitude to move down. My concern is, much as whathas already been expressed, that the fed funds rate range have someflexibility in it but that within the next six weeks there not be anymajor move to a lower level. I think the chance of moving to lowerinterest rate levels is quite likely consistent with the comments thatI made earlier in that I don't believe that the economy is going to bequite as strong as the staff is forecasting for the fourth quarter. Ithink we'll see some easing. But for the record I would like to seeus re-adopt the same money targets that we had in the third quarterand try to achieve that 5-1/2 percent growth for M1.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. I like the specifications of alternative B. Iwould neither want to raise the M1 number above 6 percent, which Ithink is a good center number to have in mind, nor to reduce it,especially following on the shortfalls that we already have had, whichI think would signal a more restrictive stance. I like thespecifications and I would leave the funds rate at 8 to 12 percent.It comes as somewhat of a shock to me that anybody would consider the8 percent a relevant number. I see the point about not going to 8percent in the short run, but I think the public relations effect ofraising it from 8 percent to 10 percent would be too difficult for usto deal with, so I wouldn't do that. Now, I must say that I don'tthink there has been anything very aggressive about monetary policy in-26-10/2/84the last 6 weeks when you remember that we are significantly--significantly by several points--short of the targets we set just 6weeks ago for the third quarter. We are three points short in thecase of M1, 2-1/2 points or more short in the case of M2, and 2 pointsshort in the case of M3. I'm surprised that policy didn't flex moretoward an easier money market stance than it did over this period.So, far from wondering why there wasn't a conference call to seewhether we should go that far, I'm wondering why there wasn't aconference call to see if we should have gone further in this periodthan we did. As I said, there's nothing wrong with these targets, butthe trouble is that our most recent record is that we don't meet thetargets. It may be that we will meet them readily or it may be thatwe won't meet them readily in the quarter to come, since we have justreceived this news about M1 perhaps falling even further short.MR. AXILROD. Please remember this is Tuesday and borrowingon Wednesday--MR. PARTEE. Well, I know. That's why you're proposingWednesday meetings, which is a very good reason for Wednesdaymeetings. But I am remembering that it looks as if we are going tohave a shortfall [in M1] and it might carry through into M2 also; Idon't know. I've been a little unhappy about an initial borrowinglevel as high as $750 million and it strengthens my view that we oughtto cut it to $650 million to start with. I see nothing wrong with a10 percent funds rate, although I guess I would have to agree that ifit goes significantly below 10 percent for a period of time, thatsignals something new and I would want to talk about it before it gotbelow 10 percent. But if reducing the initial borrowing number to$650 million happened to give us [a funds rate] moving down toward 10percent, I wouldn't be at all concerned about it. Maybe that's theproblem we're going to have, Mr. Chairman: that we all will choosealternative B but we all will have different ideas as to where [thatmay lead].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Looking at the GNPI'm a bit more optimistic than some of the comments that I have heard.I think the third quarter may very well wind up stronger than the 2.7percent that the staff has projected and that the fourth quarter, andindeed most of 1985, will be a little stronger as well. Also, I thinkthe money supply is about where we want it, notwithstanding some ofthe recent weakness. There, too, I think we will have a bit of arebound, as suggested by the Bluebook. So, the policy considerationthat flows from those hypotheses would indicate to me that a statusquo policy is appropriate, and for that reason I would opt foralternative B with a borrowing level at $750 million. I think itwould be appropriate for consultation to occur if the fed funds ratewere to drop below 10 percent. I have some sympathy with the remarksthat were made earlier about the range of the fed funds rate. Ireally don't know what 8 percent means except for public relationspurposes, but it doesn't seem to me to be very relevant in thisenvironment. If the dollar were to surge again, I would assume thatthat would cause a different policy direction, and again perhaps aconsultation would be appropriate.10/2/84Mr. Chairman, the question that I raised earlier about thedollar in terms of any significant deviation upward or downward reallywent beyond consideration of policy at this meeting. I have a concernthat we're all expecting at some point some decline in the dollar--andhopefully it would not be a precipitous decline--but nobody reallyknows and nobody knows when it's going to come down. I suppose wecould say we'll have a winner one day--that it probably is going tocome down. The question in my mind is: Is anyone looking at what ourresponse should be if there is a precipitous decline or do we dealwith this on an ad hoc basis? Maybe some planning is going on thatI'm unaware of, but I raise the question of whether there is acontingency plan and, if not, should we be looking at some kind ofcontingency plan.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if you specify the conditions thatyou are imagining, I will develop a contingency plan.MR. FORRESTAL. I don't know what the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Neither do I. That's the problem.MR. FORRESTAL. [Unintelligible.]SPEAKER(?). The Secretary of the Treasury takes care of it.MR. FORRESTAL. Well, two things occur to me: One isintervention and one is a change in policy.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know what the conditions would be.I suspect it will go down some day. I don't know whether it will bein 1984, 1985, or 1986. I suspect when it comes down it will comedown precipitously. You tell me whether the economy is vigorouslyexpanding at that point or whether it's weak and what the inflationrate is then and what the budgetary situation is and I would be gladto develop a contingency plan. But I named three variables, none ofwhich I know about at this point, and all of which would affect mycontingency plan.MR. FORRESTAL. Well, I guess if I were doing it, I would layout various scenarios.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I invite anybody who wants to engagein that exercise to engage in it. Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Being more confused than usual about the economicoutlook, which is a state I imagine most people around this table find[themselves in], it's hard to contemplate but I didn't say very muchduring the first part of the meeting. [Unintelligible] Boehne,Partee, and Gramley axis, for lack of a better term. But I think apoint that Henry made does deserve stressing and that is that if weare fortunate enough to get the 4-3/4 percent inflation rate that thestaff is projecting for next year, that would look good only inrelation to the late 1970s and early 1980s; in any other time thatwould have been considered a major economic problem. So, informulating our short-term objectives, I think we need to keep thatlonger-term objective in mind and try to hit our targets for whatwould be the 18th month in a row right on the button. If we couldcome out near the midpoint of the target, I think we would do-28-10/2/84something that would be very beneficial from the standpoint of thewhole economy.To get to the bottom line: Like Chuck, I would go with allthe provisions and specifications of "B." Unlike Chuck, though, withM1 growth picking up in September albeit not as much as I thought,given [the report] this morning that it's apparently somewhat moreelastic with respect to interest rates than we thought earlier, Ithink it's unlikely that we've seen the full response to this declinein the fed funds rate that we had earlier. So, I would be inclined tolet it sit there for a while or maybe move it down a tad at most andthen wait and see what happens.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.MR. GRAMLEY. I would buy the specs of "B": $750 million onborrowing, 6 percent for M1, and leave the fed funds rate range whereit is. Basically, I want to try to stay where we are. I would agreewith Chuck that what we have done couldn't be considered aggressiveeasing, but I think we have eased significantly. The principalconcern on my mind is that if I'm right and the staff is right on theoutlook, the greatest danger at this point is that we mightinadvertently ease too much, which would then give rise to the needfor higher interest rates later. In this connection, it seems to methat none of us knows for sure whether or not this pause, if it is apause, is going to continue through October or through the first partof November or exactly how long. That may mean that we're going to belooking at some rather weak money numbers for a while and I don'tthink we ought to panic. We ought to move gingerly toward a lowerlevel of adjustment borrowing, if that's necessary. I would be quitereluctant, for example, to see us move down to $500 million, giventhat we've moved to $750 million within the past few weeks.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I agree pretty much with whatPres Martin said. It seems to me that all of the recent developmentspoint to a need to ease monetary conditions somewhat--the behavior ofthe aggregates, the level of the exchange rate, the level of thedollar, and the outlook for inflation. Hardly anyone expects aninflation rate next year above 5 percent. The consensus outlook amongeconomists, as I read it, is between 4 and 5 percent. We ourselvesrevised our inflation forecast down. So, from almost everybody'spoint of view, the outlook for inflation is improving and is muchbetter than it was just a month or so ago. If you add to that thecondition of the thrifts, I think this is a time when we couldreasonably hope for a somewhat lower level of interest rates. I thinkthe case is as strong as it has been in recent years for some easing.Call it a probing easing if you like, but I think we ought to try toease some. Now, the good thing about the present combination ofcircumstances is--at least it seems so to me--that we can do it withvery little risk. If the economy surges in the fourth quarter orearly next year--we expect it will not, but if it does--we are in avery good position to reverse without any damage to the economy tospeak of. So, it seems to me that we can at this time think very muchin terms of reducing the reserve pressures somewhat. I would go for aposition somewhere between alternatives A and B, although GovernorPartee's specifications for alternative B are very close to what I-29-10/2/84would be willing to go along with. We could call it "B" with GovernorPartee's specifications. But I would like to see a level of borrowingaround $600 million and I'd leave the funds rate range pretty muchwhere it is.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, in my view, it's a littlepremature to try to do any further easing right now. The status quohas a lot of appeal to me. Therefore, alternative B as specified inthe Bluebook, with a $750 million dollar borrowing assumption, wouldbe very acceptable to me.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. I would go along with the specifications ofalternative B, including an initial borrowing level of $750 million.However, it seems to me what is really crucial in this decision is howwe--how you, Mr. Chairman--respond to incoming information over thenext several weeks. I would respond more quickly to a continuation ofweak aggregates and a weaker economy than I would the other wayaround. So, if we got surprised with stronger aggregate growth or astronger economy, it would take more evidence to respond than it wouldif they continue to be on the weak side, just simply because of theaccumulation of information that has come in on the weak side. Withthis kind of approach, we are more likely to end up a month from nowwith lower rates than we have now, but I think it would depend onincoming information as we proceed through the period, much as hasoccurred during the last 6 or 7 weeks.MR. PARTEE. Would you change "would" to "might" to have anasymmetrical directive?MR. BOEHNE. Well, I suppose that is more literally what I'msaying. I could live with a symmetrical directive as long as we had aslightly asymmetrical interpretation.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. I would take the specifications of "B" as is,with borrowing at $750 million. That view is partly conditioned on myview of the economy and partly conditioned on my thought that thetrajectory we are facing going into 1985 with money growth isimportant. It's also based on a belief that if incoming developmentsdid warrant some further easing, we could get a pretty quick responsein the real economy. On that I happen to agree with Frank Morris.But it's also based on not very scientific observations that suggestthat the law of averages with regard to the money supply is nowworking against us. We have gotten surprised on the down side forseveral months running and I have this fear that one of these months,for no necessarily obvious reason, we could have a big surprise on theup side. And, in that kind of circumstance, I think there is a verygreat risk of interest rates moving down much too fast--the risk ofthe whipsaw effect. I'd hate like the devil to find ourselves in aposition later this year or early next year, for whatever reasons--theeconomy, money supply, the exchange rate--where we had to reversequickly. Indeed, I would argue that that might be more damaging tothe thrifts than staying where we are in the intervening weeks and-30-10/2/84months. So, I do see a real risk of a whipsaw effect that could bevery damaging if we get too far out in front of this thing.I'd like to think that there was something that could be donewith open market operations to facilitate a soft landing of thedollar, but I guess I don't. I do have an open mind as to what kindof contingent language, symmetrical or otherwise, might be in thedirective that would permit some further reduction in the borrowinglevel if the economy and so forth warranted it. But I would be verymuch on the side of a gingerly response rather than any veryaggressive probing. I would draw that distinction.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.MR. WALLICH. Well, I would go with Alternative B. I'mpuzzled by the behavior of the aggregates. There has been more thanthe usual variation in very short-run velocity. I know that short-runvelocity doesn't mean anything, but it is puzzling to observe the upsand downs over the first half. So, the specifications seem all rightto me and borrowing of $750 million seems all right to me. On thefunds rate, I would like to put a lower limit on it. I recognize thatdoing this in the public record might have adverse repercussions. Forinstance, it might affect interest rate expectations adversely. So,perhaps we could have an understanding that we would have a telephoneconference. As for symmetry, I would prefer to stay symmetrical.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Miss Seger.MS. SEGER. I'm leaning toward the A alternative, with myfirst reason being the performance of the monetary aggregates in thethird quarter. When I look at what the various alternatives areexpected to produce in the way of monetary growth in the fourthquarter and for the 12 months in 1984, it looks as if even withalternative A the results would be within the longer-run targets withthe exception of M3, which would be just outside by a very smallamount. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the economy is definitelyslowing. I don't believe we are heading straight for a recession butI think there has been a significant slowing. I happen to agree thatit's going to continue to be on the moderate side of the spectrum andthat would suggest that some easing, as in alternative A, isappropriate. To repeat what a number of people have mentioned, thestrong dollar is a consideration here and I hope that we can dosomething to maybe at least stop its strong advance.Finally, I repeat my continuing concern about the thrifts andthe health of the financial system in general. When I look at wherethe fed funds rate would likely go based on alternative A, as I readthe statement here, it looks as if it would go somewhere between10-1/4 and 10-1/2 percent; and I don't see that as a precipitous dropin interest rates. Maybe it's my bias, having seen a lot ofvolatility in interest rates, but from where the fed funds rate is nowI would say that's on the modest side. Also, I am thinking of thesignals that we sent to money market participants this summer whenmany of them assumed that the Fed had in fact tightened. I don'tremember sitting here and voting for tightening. [That was] theconclusion that many of them drew from asymmetrical language.Consequently, I think we got an upward movement in the fed funds ratethat in fact exceeded what we were talking about here at the time--at-31-10/2/84least what I thought we were hoping for. Having said all that, Iwould prefer to go with some easing and in general what is shown herein alternative A.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.MR. ROBERTS. I would prefer that we use alternative B butmake certain that we do everything possible to accomplish the M1growth projected for the fourth quarter. I think the recentexperience has demonstrated that when we have too many targets we canget inconsistencies in borrowing and interest rates and money and itprobably is too big a pot. I would concentrate on money and if thatcaused us to lower the borrowing level or lower interest rates inorder to accomplish that, I would be in favor of that. It seems to methat we have a broadly based economic expansion that has reached ahigh level and is turning a little sluggish but still doing all right.Price [increases] have slowed down. Interest rates have come downsignificantly. And we're dealing here with lags. What we have at themoment reflects the past monetary growth and what we do now willaffect the future. And contrary to what Emmett mentioned, myobservation is that people at the Conference Board, Chase, DRI,Morgan, and Citicorp, all are looking for 4-1/2 to 6 percent inflationnext year in the projections that I see. And that's the range that Isee also. We're right in the middle of the ranges on the money supplyand I think we ought to try to stay right there.MR. RICE. The Association of Business Economists, anorganization of 200 people, is looking for an inflation rate somewherebetween 4 and 5 percent. I also noticed yesterday that our shadowsexpect an inflation rate between 3 and 4 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a little dangerous that they saidthey were content with policy!MR. GRAMLEY. They also said that underlying policy isconsistent with 6 to 7 percent inflation and that unless we bringmoney down, we might get worse results.MR. PARTEE. And they were talking about 10 percent [on thefunds rate] by the end of this year, weren't they?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I also heard that they approved whatwe have done this year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's what it said in the paper. Mr.Griffith.MR. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, the Twelfth District supportsthe specifications of "B" and very much what Ted just said and whatBob Boykin said. We think it's premature to make any change rightnow. We don't [know] exactly where the stop point is. And the pointthat Jerry Corrigan made our staff thinks is very important: that if[rates] were to go down too much too quickly, we could find ourselvesstarting off 1985 with the whipsaw effect. And for that reason wefeel very strongly about the specifications of "B" as written.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.-32-10/2/84MR. KEEHN. For reasons that have been well stated, I thinkalternative B would be the most desirable alternative at this point.Clearly, there has been a moderation in the rate of economic growth.I think there is a disagreement around the table as to whether or notwe are headed toward a more negative environment or indeed just downto a more sustainable rate of growth. But it does seem to me thatfrom a monetary policy point of view, things are lined up awfully wellat this point and the fundamentals are really right and that it wouldbe premature to be making any kind of significant change. We are in aperiod where we would want to watch it pretty carefully but,fortunately, we have another meeting coming up in a fairly briefperiod of time. As a consequence, at this meeting alternative B seemsto me to be the most appropriate alternative with borrowing of, say,$750 million, but I'd have a high element of flexibility on thatborrowing. And I would attempt very hard to achieve a growth rate ofM1 in the 6 percent area.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Horn.MS. HORN. I support alternative B and I share very stronglythe concerns that Jerry expressed and that were expressed by someother people around the table. Maybe I will just state it in aslightly different way. I would not like to give the market the wrongsignal through borrowing and the fed funds rate. Now, if I only knewwhat the wrong signal was--.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Exactly. We could all share that.MS. HORN. But, since I don't, moving slowly seems to me thebest approach. And I would support "B."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think you have identified theright question. There is clearly a strong consensus for "B" with acouple of exceptions. That is not surprising when we are talkingabout numbers for the money supply, which look nice. Most people havesuggested not changing the fed funds rate [range]. That sounds rightto me too; I don't see how we can raise the lower limit withoutgetting peculiar interpretations. I thought we had a very fulldiscussion at the last meeting of what to do in terms of contingenciesand I must say I don't ever remember being in a position [during anintermeeting period] when every indicator that I looked at appeared tobe in the same direction and neatly fit the directive for moving down.Whether I looked at M1, M2, M3, reserves, the exchange rate, theeconomy--what else have I left out here?MR. PARTEE. Prices.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Prices--except for that last consumerprice index number. That was the only fly in the ointment. But theproducer price index and everything else seemed to fit exactly in acontingency that we considered and discussed at some length at themeeting as to how we would react under those circumstances. The onething that was really surprising and added a little edge to the way weoperated was the exchange rate. One could have argued that we shouldhave been a little more aggressive in our monetary policy [response].At least that's my thinking. In any event, that's behind us.-33-10/2/84We seem to have votes for "B," which I interpret as includingboth the funds rate range and the aggregates. There are somedifferences of opinion on how that is to be dealt with. I wouldremind you of what Si Keehn just said. We meet again in 5 weeks; it'sa relatively short period of time. I didn't hear anybody talkingabout a higher borrowings number. Some people were talking about alower one and a number of people were talking explicitly or implicitlyabout not being too slow to move lower, if the evidence suggests that.Someplace in this area we ought to be able to reach some kind ofconsensus operationally. I don't like the directive as Mr. Sternlightand Mr. Axilrod wrote it, I must say. It starts out by saying policyis unchanged. I'll be more correct in my words; it says the"implementation of policy has been unchanged" when it obviously waschanged in the last month. If we were to read all of our directivesin succession, they would never say anything was changed, although infact they were changed.MR. PARTEE. That's traditional.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I recall we had an argument aboutthis once before. But it seems to me that the first sentence ought toacknowledge that we have somewhat less pressure on reserves than wedid at the time of the last meeting [when we adopted a directive] thatsaid no change unless something happens. Well, something happened.That's a more or less technical point. The real question is what wedo thereafter. I certainly share the view that some have expressedthat if things continue coming in on the low side and/or the exchangerate continues very strong, we shouldn't be very reluctant to easefurther in the kind of range that has been discussed here. I, myself,am somewhat indifferent as to whether or not we do that right now. Idon't think it is necessary [to take action now]. We have a verypeculiar technical situation now where the funds rate is very high--and borrowings have been very high just in the last few days--relativeto what one would think it would be with this borrowing level. Theactual borrowing level we're going to publish is going to be way aboveour target. It's going to confuse people. And we are looking towarda great excess of reserves later in the week that may or may not bereflected very promptly in the funds rate. How we will handle that Idon't know, but we are well above any borrowing number--about twice--that anybody has been talking about for the first week of this two-week period. And getting it down to any of these borrowing numbers inthe course of this week is inconceivable. It would have to go to zeroright away. So, during this period, we're going to have a much higherlevel of borrowing than any of these numbers we are talking about.Whether there was anything that could have been done about that, Idon't know, but it's too late now. We are going to start off thefirst week of this five-week period with a very high level ofborrowing relative to what we're presumably aiming at, which may meanthat the funds rate temporarily will go quite low later in the week.In that case we obviously will be selling--not necessarily this week,but later in the two-week averaging period.MR. PARTEE. Is this the first week of a two-week period?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, this is the first week of the two-week period. Just as a guess, the funds rate isn't going to declineall that precipitously later in this calendar week but the banks mayhave such an accumulation of excess reserves by the early part of next-34-10/2/84week that it may plunge. And they will be even further confused bywhat we're trying to do. I have my doubts about these two-weekaveraging periods the more experience we have with that; the banksdon't seem to have a very good idea of where the funds rate should beand it moves all over the lot.MR. GRAMLEY. Maybe we should go back to lagged reserveaccounting.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know how much that affects it. Itmay be that the contemporaneous reserve accounting makes them so muchmore uncertain about their reserve positions that it contributes toit. It may be a combination of the two.MR. PARTEE. [Unintelligible] uncertainty.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In any event, in substance I will attemptto interpret what people are saying or some mean of what people aresaying. We start where we are, or close to where we are, and arepretty prompt to move lower if the money supply weakness is furtherconfirmed, if the dollar is strong, and if economic weakness isrelatively further confirmed. All these signals would have to bepretty strong to carry us to borrowing as low as $500 million, Ithink, but not so strong to carry us down to $650 million or $600million. The signals would have to be clear, but not extreme. BeforeI talk about language, how does that sound?MR. GRAMLEY. I for one would repeat my own concern aboutmoving too far too fast because I don't think we know when the economyis going to start picking up again. I thought I heard a fair numberof people share that concern; maybe not. There were a number ofpeople who were worried, as I am, about the possibility that ifinterest rates come down too much and if the economy then recoversrates would go bouncing back up again. And that's not a desirabledevelopment, in my judgment.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, what we want to examine is how muchis too much too fast. I would remind you, we now have a borrowinglevel that is down by $250 million, presumably, in terms of theprevious target, with the fed funds rate as of the last few days downpractically not at all. A lot of other things are going on. I don'tknow what you're thinking of. Putting it in terms of interest ratesis easier to describe.MR. GRAMLEY. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't have in my mind a 10 percent fundsrate at this point.MR. PARTEE. I don't think we are talking about very much,Lyle.MR. GRAMLEY. If the funds rate were to get down into the10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent range, I wouldn't be acutely uncomfortable.If it gets down to 10 percent, having been up to 11-1/2 percent only afew weeks ago, that just seems to me to be too big a move.-35-10/2/84MR. PARTEE. But the 11-1/2 percent was an aberration to aconsiderable degree.MR. GRAMLEY. Well, yes, except it stayed up in that 11-1/4to 11-1/2 percent range for quite some time. To go down more than afull percentage point in a matter of 6 to 8 weeks--.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, nobody knows. And we get dailyfluctuations in the numbers; we already have. But to give you thestate of my mind: I'm not thinking of a 10 percent funds rate at thispoint as a likely outcome without a good deal more weakness than whatwe've already seen.MR. CORRIGAN. There is one thing I'm very uncomfortableabout. As you stated, when you start out at $750 million, you'rewilling to go to $650 million and if the funds rate comes down alittle more in the circumstance that you described, I think that'sprobably all right. My hunch is that, absent this precautionarypremium or whatever we want to call it, the funds rate probably wouldmove down by itself in the fourth quarter in the context in which wehad money growth around 6 percent and borrowings around $750 million.But my real concern is the other contingency: that events could verywell precipitate an increase in that precautionary premium. Then, wewould end up with a situation in which at any borrowing level, thefederal funds rate would tend to be higher. And then we would be leftwith a Catch-22 situation where money growth, wherever it may be,could be in some structural sense out of line with what is observed inthe federal funds market and what is observed with the level ofborrowing. And I just don't know what to do about that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure what contingency you'retalking about. There could be a million of them. Are you saying theimplication, if the money supply should be high, is that--MR. CORRIGAN. Now, that would be the worst. I'm saying thatthe contingency I'm concerned about would be if this precautionaryatmosphere that we see in the way banks are managing their money isintensified.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand that, but if that gives atight [funds] market and money supply growth is relatively low,presumably we would ease the pressures on reserve positions. That'sfairly easy.MR. CORRIGAN. Yes, but my concern is that we might get thatin a context in which money growth is strong.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, then you've got a differentsituation.MR. CORRIGAN. Then we have a real problem.MR. PARTEE. But we have these guides in the directive forthe money supply growth, if it is strong.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but he's saying he doesn't like that,presumably, when something looks contrary or peculiar. If we hadrising interest rates and high money supply growth, then I think we-36-10/2/84would have to rethink it. I don't know how you write that in thedirective.MR. MARTIN. You can't cover every eventuality.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that is clearly one where we'dhave to rethink it.MR. CORRIGAN. I think there's a good chance we may beconfronted with that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we may; I don't know what we woulddo about it.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We have to be careful not to go backand overemphasize the importance of short-run money supply numbers.They may not be telling us anything.MR. PARTEE. Or they might be telling us something.MR. MARTIN. When we've had them for four months!VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But, normally, we look at longerperiods, and in longer periods we seem to be all right. I understandthat a lot of the recent economic indicators are somewhat weaker, butas long as we're doing so well in the long run [with respect to] theannual money targets why should we be that concerned about correctingthe short run?MR. MARTIN. [Is] the short run 3 to 4 months?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't know what that lag is.MR. PARTEE. I agree with you, Tony, but I do think that asthe evidence accumulates we have to begin to recognize it. We had theweak July and then the staff said that August would snap back. ThenAugust was low and they said that September would be good. NowSeptember seems to be revising down, and in this case they don't seemto have much hope that October is going to be strong. Maybe, tocomplete the whole circle, October will be very strong. Right now itdoesn't seem to look it. So, we're starting to develop [a pattern of]some months.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If October is going to be strong, it'sgoing to have to show up, I suspect, in the figure for October 8th,which we won't have for a while. And, if it doesn't show up then,we'll be in trouble in October because we'll have a couple of weeks inOctober below the September average.MR. PARTEE. Well, the $8 billion increase that's--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, they usually come in the first orsecond week in the month; that's why I say that. If it doesn't comeby October 8th, I think we're unlikely to get an increase like that.MR. PARTEE. So that becomes four months of low growth. Fourmonths is not as long as a year, but it's approaching six months and-37-10/2/84one starts to take it into account a little. At least that's the wayI look at it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. As in September, if we had a great bigincrease that first full week in October, it wouldn't mean much; itmight be necessary to put October at 6 percent.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Which would be all right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Which is what happened in September.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Coming back to the question that youposed, I would agree with the basic strategy as you formulated it interms of continuing where we are on the borrowing level, thealternative B numbers, and using your discretion that if everythingcomes in weak to go down to $600 or $650 million [on borrowing]. Butit seems to me that a large number of us are concerned too about theperception as well as the substance of a large drop in interest ratesengineered by the Fed in the next critical 5 to 6 weeks. And it seemsto me that, under those circumstances, there would have to be a strongenough case for you to call a Committee consultation if you want to gobelow $600 million. If it's something in that area, that seems to mean appropriate way of touching different bases.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't have any great problem with that,but my only connection with all the various political or semi-political sensitivities that have been mentioned is that, justspeaking personally, I'm not very impressed with any of them I mustsay. I don't necessarily agree with the Vice Chairman's fiscal policystrategy. I'm not sure we'd know how to play that one. I'd just playit straight. And, in connection with the next few weeks, I'd play itstraight too.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, if there's an overwhelming casefor--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you say overwhelming--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Or clear case.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A reasonably clear case. That's all I'msaying.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The markets don't have as pessimistica view as I think you and Pres Martin and maybe Emmett have beenreflecting today.MR. RICE. I don't have a pessimistic view.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Oh, I misunderstood you. I think themarket view is quite clearly one that this is a temporary weakness--this 3-1/2 percent that we see on the third-quarter flash [GNP report]--and that the fourth quarter will continue with moderate strength.And I think it's important that we have a clear case before we'reperceived as doing some very substantial easing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's a matter of degree. But Ithink it can be overemphasized. The market may be wrong and then-38-10/2/84we're going to look like damn fools, and pretty quickly. The marketcouldn't understand that we were easing earlier. But I think it'sfully accepted and it's very hard to [find] fault with it, I think, intheir view. I don't get any sense of complaint about it or wonderingabout it at this stage, although they didn't quite anticipate it.There was a kind of disbelief for some weeks.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think you did the right thing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The question is how the economy and thedollar and all the rest will behave. And none of us knows that.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think you did the right thing, butI guess I'm surprised also. For a man who's as skeptical as you areand most of us are about what the economic indicators are telling usabout the real economy, don't you think it is dangerous to try tofine-tune an interest rate response so quickly? After all, we onlybegan to see these weaker economic indicators that I'm talking aboutin the last few weeks. I think your judgment has been vindicated, butwe only began to see a few weeks ago these indicators showing moreweakness. And they could possibly have been wrong.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It wasn't just the numbers on the economy.I think they began showing up immediately after the last meeting. Wehad an extreme movement in the dollar and continued weakness in themonetary aggregates.MR. PARTEE. There were shortfalls in all of them.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but since we ignored thestrength of the dollar previously in domestic monetary policy, I guessI don't quite understand why this last speculative bubble had thatmuch more impact on this situation. Although I agree with thedirection of it, the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It was pretty extreme. In terms of myforeign colleagues, outrage is a little strong, but [their reactionverged] on outrage that we didn't pay more attention to it.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I know. But then I heard verycritical comments from the key actors on the European side--centralbankers I'm talking about--that our intervention was so feeble that itdidn't really mean anything.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't disagree with that, but there wasvery little support for intervention without monetary policy action onthe part of the United States.Well, I think we are in an asymmetrical position; that'swhere my gut tells me we are. [The issue is] whether or not we put itdown in the directive. I would. If the economy suddenly reboundedand the money supply began running significantly higher thanalternative B, I would question what we do, particularly in thecontext of the dollar not strengthening further. I can imaginecircumstances in which one might want to tighten, but I'd be prettyhard pressed to imagine what those circumstances would be in the nextfive weeks. It does not strain my credulity at all to think that wemight want to go at least modestly in the other direction in the next-39-10/2/84five weeks. And I would think that the directive ought to reflectthat. But just how it reflects that is--MR. PARTEE. Well, as I suggested, we could just change the"might" and "would."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I know. We could do that.MR. PARTEE. Or we could change the order of the two parts ofthe sentence.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That, I think, is the minimum that oneought to do. Mr. Axilrod could distribute this [draft] that really isasymmetrical, if you're interested in looking at it. It would startout by saying "In the implementation of policy in the short run theCommittee seeks to maintain the lesser degree of restraint on reservepositions sought in recent weeks." That's more or less technical; itacknowledges that we did something. Then, we'd put in the sentencewith basically the alternative B [specifications]. It would go on tosay that a somewhat or slightly further lessening of restraint onreserve positions would be acceptable in the light of significantlyslower growth in the monetary aggregates, particularly in the contextof continued moderation in economic activity and inflationarypressures. Then we'd go on with the standard language.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I thought it would be "only" in thecontext. That implies that even without any weakening in the realeconomy there would be even less restraint just because of weakness inthe monetary aggregates--that that alone would trigger it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It says "particularly in the context of."VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Whereas the one we had before thatsaid--MR. PARTEE. It said "only."VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. --"only in."MR. MARTIN. Continued moderation in economic activity andinflationary pressures.MR. GRAMLEY. You're dropping out the tightening[alternative] altogether.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In this version. We can put it back in,but I'd put it in another sentence--unless you want to use somethinglike "particularly." Otherwise, we could just drop the next sentence.MR. PARTEE. Yes, or leave the next sentence and drop thelast phrase.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The one thing that bothers me about thisis that there is then no mention, except in another paragraph, ofcredit market conditions and the exchange rate. That is obscurely inthere now with financial market conditions. That could be worked insomehow, I suppose. Let's put a comma, and then "taking account offinancial market conditions and the rate of credit growth."-40-10/2/84MR. GUFFEY. Doesn't that appear in the sentence immediatelyabove the start of the operating paragraph?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It does, but it doesn't get much attentionthere. It's not in the operative part of the directive. I don't haveit in front of me, but you are right that there is a--MR. PARTEE. My point, Paul, was that we could drop thatwhole phrase starting with "particularly" and instead make it a phrasesuch as "evaluated in relation not only to indicators of the strengthof..." and just continue right on. Now, that makes it a one-sideddirective, but I think it would solve Tony's problem that we wouldonly look at easing in the context of weak money numbers and theconfirming business and inflationary and credit situations.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think it's a mistake not to havesomething on both sides. We can achieve the purpose you want bysimply revising the existing sentence and putting the easier restraintfirst and then leaving the rest of the directive exactly as it is.So, it would read: "Somewhat lesser reserve restraint would beacceptable in the context of significantly slower growth of theaggregates or somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable in theevent of more substantial growth. In either case..." and so on. Itjust seems to me that, with a couple of months of weakness in economicactivity, to send a signal out that we have completely ruled out ofour thinking any possibility that we would react to events on theother side is wrong. It's not the way to do things.MR. BOEHNE. I'd like to piggyback on that. I think anasymmetrical directive, or at least a tilt in that direction, makessense. But I think the image that this directive will create, incontrast to the last directive, is a stronger change than I wouldthink the Committee would want to convey. After all, the lastdirective, which was symmetrical, enabled a rather significant drop inthe borrowings, which I happen to think was a wise thing to do. But Ijust wonder if one has to move that far in this directive. Some tiltor some small signal, yes; but this just seems to me to highlight itand it's awfully strong for my taste.MR. WALLICH. I think it would indicate a real policy shiftif we dropped the up side of the symmetry.MR. GUFFEY. I would agree.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. And I would agree, obviously.MR. CORRIGAN. In the context of what I thought you weresaying before, Mr. Chairman, in terms of borrowings that could getdown to, say, $600 to $650 million and a federal funds rate that couldget down to 10 percent or 10-1/2 percent or something like that, Ithink that contingency could be covered easily in a directive thattilts rather than falls. Again, I must say that the danger thatreally bothers me is this whipsaw phenomenon I spoke of before. If wewent through a period where we had, say, a 150 basis points swing upand down in short-term interest rates in a period of three months orso, I think that would be very, very damaging to the real economy andfor the thrifts, for the banks, and for everybody else.-41-10/2/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't see why, but that's--MR. CORRIGAN. I would say the reason why is that if we startto move in that direction in a context in which it's perceived thatthere is a potential for a rather large move, the markets will respondvery aggressively. We'll get another surge of all this crazy activityin the mortgage markets and then it will just get stopped dead in itstracks if interest rates have to turn around.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I agree with Jerry completely. Themore they see us responding quickly to short-run changes in themonetary aggregates, the more people in the market are going to say"Are we going to go back to the extreme swings that we had where rateswere running between 8 and 20 percent?". I think we have to becareful of that; we ought to be moving very gradually.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you are assuming much morecontrollability of the market than in fact we have.MR. CORRIGAN. I don't have any problem--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This great 1-1/2 percentage pointreduction in long-term rates took place without any change in ourborrowing assumption at all. We reduced the borrowing by $250million--this massive move that you talk about--and long-term ratesare practically where they were before we started moving borrowingdown. And how far down the federal funds rate is, I don't even know.It depends upon whether you look at it on Friday or Monday orWednesday.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, that's because of specialfactors that you talked about earlier.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But it depends upon so many other factorsthat thinking we can predict this with any assurance is a bit beyondour capacity.MR. CORRIGAN. I don't have any trouble with the substance ofwhat I think you're saying. I don't even have any trouble with thesuggestion that it would take some considerable set of circumstancesto envision a tightening move in the next five weeks. But what I dohave trouble with is creating a perception that what we have in mindis more than what I think you're saying. Most people are saying--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think you're assuming conditionsthat I'm not assuming on this.MR. CORRIGAN. I may be.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All this easing that you're talking abouttakes place in the context of continuing quite sluggish businessnumbers, a strong dollar, and low money growth.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, in those circumstances, if the borrowinglevel goes down in this five-week period, or even early in the five-week period, to this $650 or $600 million--10/2/84VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Earlier you said you had no objectionto making it double-barrelled as long as it's only tilted, but Iassume that you don't object to putting back in some contingencylanguage on the other side.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If it's too formalistic, I think we'rejust doing a very formalistic thing and not being very enlightening.But I don't have any objection to dealing with that.MR. BOEHNE. May I suggest that you keep the sentence thatyou have there beginning with "A somewhat further lessening ofrestraint" and drop that last sentence? But in its place, we couldhave a sentence that would go something like this: "Some increase inreserve restraint might possibly be appropriate in the context ofsubstantially greater growth in the monetary aggregates."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have no objection to something likethat.MR. WALLICH. Other than "possibly."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I don't know whether you want theword "possibly" in there.MR. GRAMLEY. Why not just take the existing sentence andreverse the order?MR. GUFFEY. Indeed. That's a good suggestion.MR. BOYKIN. Yes, that's what I think.MR. PARTEE. Well, if we want to tilt it, we could say "wellabove" instead of "high growth."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is a very minor thing, but I wouldnot just take this existing sentence and reverse the order because itsounds so formalistic.MR. PARTEE. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We would have changed nothing and peopleare supposed to read great meaning into the changing of the order of asentence without one iota of change in the substance. That sounds alittle too much. But if you put in an adjective or two, I don't mindthat if you prefer it.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. A moderate adjective?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This time I'm partly objecting because itrather sounds to me like we're playing games instead of reflectinganything substantive.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think perhaps you have a strongerview from the down side of the economy than most of us have.MR. PARTEE. If you really want to change the structure, Iwould go back to my proposal that we use your first sentence and thensay "evaluated in relation not only" and so forth. Then we could have-43-10/2/84another sentence that says "Conversely, if the monetary aggregates arestrong and there is associated strength showing in the economy"--MR. CORRIGAN. I could easily support that.MR. WALLICH. "Conversely" strikes me as balancing it in theright direction.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It sounds a little less formalistic to methan just reversing [the order].MR. PARTEE. Well, it is. It really does change it somewhat,I think, but not a great deal.MR. GRAMLEY. But wouldn't you want to put that sentencebefore the "in any event" sentence?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, he's combining those two sentences.MR. PARTEE. No, I'm combining them and dropping that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The way he would have it read is "Asomewhat further lessening of restraint on reserve positions would beacceptable in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetaryaggregates evaluated in relation not only to the indicated strength ofthe business expansion and inflationary pressures, but also tofinancial market conditions and the rate of credit growth." That's arather cumbersome sentence, but it's all right. "Conversely, greaterrestraint might" or "would be acceptable."MR. PARTEE. "Might," I think.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is "acceptable" the word? We'd say"acceptable in the event of"--well, "significantly" is the obviousword to put in here but we used "significantly" up above.MR. PARTEE. "Monetary growth well above the numbersexpected." Is that what we call it?MR. GRAMLEY. "Well above these expectations."MR. AXILROD. "Growth substantially more rapid."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "Substantially more rapid monetarygrowth." Is that--MR. PARTEE. That would be all right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "And indications of"--we can't exactly saya rebound. "Indications of stronger"?MR. PARTEE. "New strength" or something like that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "Economic growth and credit expansion."[Unintelligible] Jack Kemp's concerns.MR. PARTEE. "Indications of stronger expansion in economicand financial developments."-44-10/2/84VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Sounds great. Real prose--poetry, infact.MR. PARTEE. Or "stronger economic and credit market"--MR. AXILROD. Add "inflationary pressures." I wrote"indications of significant strengthening in economic activity andinflationary pressures."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I think it's good to get the[reference to] inflationary pressures in there--"of economic activityand inflationary pressures."MR. PARTEE. It's hard to imagine we'll have evidence of allthis in five weeks.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that's right.MR. BLACK. More than fragmentary indications.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I know what I have now, and what'sthe rest of it?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The usual boiler.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The usual last two sentences, or just thelast sentence. It goes directly to the last sentence.MR. GRAMLEY. Sometime we ought to put out a directive whichsays "Complete with the usual boiler plate"!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just read it: "In theimplementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks tomaintain the lesser degree of restraint on reserve positions sought inrecent weeks. This action is expected to be consistent with growth inM1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of 6, 7-1/2, and 9 percent,respectively, during the period from September to December. Asomewhat further lessening of restraint on reserve positions would beacceptable in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetaryaggregates, evaluated in relation--." Why don't we take out this "notonly" bit to simplify the sentence?SPEAKER(?). Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --"evaluated in relation to the strengthof business expansion and inflationary pressures and financial marketconditions and the rate of credit growth." Am I right?MR. AXILROD. Did you want to put "financial and exchangemarket conditions"?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "Domestic and international." Put ineverything but the kitchen sink! "...domestic and internationalfinancial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth.Conversely, greater restraint might be acceptable in the event ofsubstantially more rapid monetary growth and indications ofsignificant strengthening of economic activity and inflationary-45-10/2/84pressures. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation" etc.And we leave in 8 to 12 percent [for the funds rate range].SPEAKER(?). Sounds right.MR. MARTIN. Then we want 8.MR. GRAMLEY. Would you read that significant strengtheningin economic activity [part]?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "...strengthening of economic activity andinflationary pressures."MR. PARTEE. That's right. The current range is up to 12percent. That's just as well, isn't it, Steve?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that is satisfactory, we will vote.MR. BERNARD.Chairman Volcker YesVice Chairman Solomon YesPresident Boehne YesPresident Boykin YesPresident Corrigan YesGovernor Gramley YesPresident Horn YesGovernor Martin NoGovernor Partee YesGovernor Rice NoGovernor Seger NoGovernor Wallich YesCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay, I guess we are finished.END OF MEETING-46-
