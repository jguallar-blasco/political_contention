It was noted that theunwinding of this situation was likely to take some time and that firmdata on the dollar volume of securities involved were not yet available.As to the System's role, it was understood that the Desk would standready to lend securities to assist in the efficient functioning of thegovernment securities market in accordance with the broadened termsand conditions for such lending approved by the FOMC in a vote conductedlate yesterday and today. It was further understood that the Desk wouldnot be restricted in its lending by a dollar limit, but would encourageborrowers to seek securities elsewhere first. All loans made by the Systemmust be fully collateralized and the Desk should also ensure that sufficientcollateral margin (which might appropriately be higher than that requiredin normal circumstances) is tendered by the borrower. Very tentativeestimates of the order of magnitude of prospective demands for loans ofsecurities from the System portfolio were: at least $1-1/4 billion by$400-$500 million by and smalleramounts by a number of other potential borrowers.The broader question of how to avoid a recurrence of this kindof problem in the future was also discussed. As an initial step in thatdirection it was decided that Mr. Sternlight and other representatives-2-from the New York Reserve Bank would attend upcoming sessions scheduledby the Government Securities Dealers Association on this subject. Itwas also agreed that the question of whether to seek regulatory authorityto deal with such problems should be studied and that at some future timethe Chairman might initiate discussions with the Treasury on this matter.
