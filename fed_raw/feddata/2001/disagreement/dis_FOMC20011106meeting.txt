And I have great faith that it will be picking up.
How, when, and to what degree, I don’t know, but I think this economy has a lot of resilience.
In fact, people 11/6/01 89 have mentioned that lower rates now could actually increase long rates because the market apparently sees a quicker pickup than does our forecast.
There’s probably not a lot of difference between a move of 25 or 50 basis points today.
I don’t see big differences in outcomes.
I don’t see the stark distinctions that Don was drawing and I don’t see major differences in being wrong here.
But I do think that a 25 basis point cut would suggest a bit more control on our part.
I think it would show that we are being more forward-looking rather than focusing on the recent incoming data.
To me it would indicate that wherever we stop the policy position might be a little less stimulative to the inevitable upturn than otherwise.
I don’t see the comparison to the current Japanese situation, though I fully understand the front-loading part of that argument.
<START>I don’t think going 25 basis points versus 50 would indicate that the central bank in the United States is part of the problem rather than part of the solution.<END>
But all that said, I do take your points on the feedback effects of the international situation now and the potential for a downward spiral.
And if the psychology doesn’t work domestically, I think it does work a little on the international side.
<START>It’s a tough call for me right now but I am willing to go with your leadership.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I started out my comments earlier by saying that this is an uncertain and unprecedented time.
That clearly was evident as we went around the room and heard the comments during the go-around, which I too found very depressing.
I expected it coming into the meeting because all the data and all the anecdotes were so negative.
I guess at some point we are going to get some positive anecdotes.
I keep looking for them but I haven’t found them yet.
11/6/01 90 There is clearly a risk that the greater caution we’ve seen by consumers and business firms could cumulate into a more severe recession.
When one looks at the consensus of the forecasts that are out there, those forecasts seem to discount anything like that.
I personally think the economy is going to be weaker than the Greenbook forecast and weaker than my staff’s forecast too for that matter.
Therefore, I do feel that a 50 basis point cut is safer and I support it.
I, too, am concerned about the interconnectedness of the international economy and the feedback to our economy, which is the result of globalization--a development that, of course, all of us have supported for many, many years.
I think we just have to watch the situation very, very carefully as we move forward.
So I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President McTeer.
MR.
MCTEER.
Mr. Chairman, first I’d like to correct the record regarding Al and I swapping hats.
The point of my remembering the Alamo was that even though the defenders lost the battle it was not because they were keeping their powder dry.
So basically, he came around to my point of view!
[Laughter] I agree with your recommendation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Guynn.
MR.
GUYNN.
Mr. Chairman, this is the most fascinating meeting in my six years at the table.
People have often asked me if I ever change my mind during the course of a meeting and I always say “yes,” but I’m not sure that I often do.
Today is probably the exception.
I not only went into the weekend but I came out of the weekend thinking that either no policy action today or a modest move was the right decision.
I certainly have come some way during the course of the meeting and I think I understand the downside risks more fully.
Having said that, I’m still of the view that a modest move today feels more right to me.
<START>I think Don made a credible argument for such a policy.<END>
I share the concerns of Cathy Minehan and Bill Poole that we may in fact build in 11/6/01 91 expectations for even more easing than we would like.
I think there’s even a chance of a scare factor;
people will think that we believe the economy is far worse than they thought.
Having said all that, I support your recommendation and understand the arguments for a 50 basis point move.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Will you read the appropriate wording?
MR.
BERNARD.
This is from page 13 in the Bluebook:
“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 2 percent.” The sentence for the press statement would be:
<START>“Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth, and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.<END>
Would you call the roll?
MR.
BERNARD.
Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman McDonough YesGovernor Ferguson YesPresident Hoenig YesGovernor Kelley YesGovernor Meyer YesPresident Minehan YesPresident Moskow YesPresident Poole YesVICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
You missed Governor Gramlich.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
May I vote also?
[Laughter] I believe I’m entitled to.
MR.
BERNARD.
All right, Governor Gramlich.
I have you voting “yes.” [Laughter] 11/6/01 92 MR. GRAMLICH.
I didn’t think I was that transparent!
I vote “yes.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The preliminary statement that has been drafted is very close to the previous one.
It’s very short and it will be circulated to you.
In the meantime I request that the Board of Governors retire to the room next door so that we can act on a discount rate request.
So, this meeting is in recess and we will return shortly.
[Recess] MS. MINEHAN.
Do you need a vote on this statement?
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
No. MS.
MINEHAN.
I just want to ask whether it’s really necessary to make what could be interpreted as derogatory references to enhancing security.
<START>It’s clear that the diversion of resources to security enhancement will have a negative effect on productivity, but do we really need to say that in this statement?<END>
After all, the whole world is dependent upon people feeling comfortable with the security measures being taken because the world has changed forever, in my view anyway.
People need to feel that these measures will be beneficial for the long term.
I don’t think we need to say this.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
<START>I think that’s a valid criticism.<END>
Would somebody else like to comment on it?
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
<START>Well, if we don’t say something about the reduction in productivity over the short run, for whatever reason, the statement will suggest that we think productivity is going to bounce back as soon as this economic slowdown abates.<END>
That sounds too much like whistling in the wind.
I’m not sure we need to blame it on protection and security measures.
<START>But I think we have to say that something is happening that likely will affect productivity adversely for a while.<END>
11/6/01 93 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
No, I agree with that.
I think the question is whether or not we phrase it in the way it is phrased here.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Can we just say that because of the economic slowdown or the cyclical impact or something like that productivity growth will slow?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
No, there is a heightened risk premium that has occurred as a consequence of this.
What we’re talking about, in the extreme form, is the elimination of just-in-time inventories.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Yes, I know what you mean.
But I don’t think this is the time to be sounding quite so negative about security.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Well, could we say the “appropriate” or the “necessary” diversion of resources to enhance security or something along those lines to suggest that it is well understood that resources will be used in this way?
MR.
KELLEY.
I think the word “necessary” is good.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, why don’t we say the “necessary diversion of resources”?
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
Yes, that does it.
MR.
PARRY.
Or how about just the “reallocation of resources”?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
No, “necessary” addresses the issue that Cathy is raising.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
That turns it positive.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Is that adequate?
MR.
GRAMLICH.
Well, let me first comment on the broader point and I’ll also talk about the words used.
<START>Continuing with Bill McDonough’s whistling in the wind argument, I think we also have to show that we recognize this phenomenon, whether we call it a reallocation or a 11/6/01 94 diversion of resources.<END>
So I think we actually have to tie that in there.
“Necessary” is fine with me.
Also, there’s a double clause in there with “and protect against disruptions.” We might not need that.
A lot of words are devoted to that sentence and it could be stripped down.
<START>But in my view we have to recognize not only that it will be a while before productivity comes back, but also that a diversion of resources is occurring.<END>
Otherwise the message just doesn’t look real.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Would you feel better if we said:
“The necessary diversion of resources to enhance security is likely to detract from advances in productivity for a time”?
MR.
KOHN.
How about “necessary reallocation of resources”?
I think that was somebody’s suggestion.
That sounds a little better.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
Okay.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
That’s better.
MS.
MINEHAN.
But the economic slowdown all by itself produces a reduction in productivity.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
No, the reference here is to structural productivity.
I might note that the estimate for productivity in the third quarter is going to be coming out tomorrow.
<START>I don’t know what the precise number is going to be, but it’s going to show strong productivity in the quarter.<END>
<START>If we subtracted out the September 11th problem, it would be supportive of the fact that there have been structural changes in productivity in the last four or five years.<END>
MS.
MINEHAN.
Yes.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
So it’s not cyclical productivity we’re talking about.
MS.
MINEHAN.
No, I realize that.
MR.
JORDAN.
Mr. Chairman, could I offer a slightly different perspective?
It may be consistent with what is bothering Cathy.
The last clause is a clear statement that productivity growth 11/6/01 95 is good.
I might think that and everybody around this table might think that.
But hypothetically, suppose 20 years ago we had substituted for the term “to enhance security” the phrase “to clean up the air and the water”?
The vast majority of people believe that whatever is being done in our country to enhance security is for the good.
For the tone of our statement to somehow suggest that it is really unfortunate that our country has to do this, I think is very undesirable.
MS.
MINEHAN.
That’s my point exactly.
You stated it so much better than I did.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I agree with that.
That’s why the words “necessary reallocation”-- MS. MINEHAN.
I don’t think that takes away the negative tenor.
MS.
JOHNSON.
Pardon me, but it’s a measurement issue, isn’t it?
The GDP doesn’t measure increased security;
it doesn’t give better security a positive weight.
Is there a way to get the word “measurement” in here?
SPEAKER(?).
Measured productivity.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, that may do it.
MS.
MINEHAN.
We’re trying to get across a very sophisticated concept here.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, measured productivity.
I think the key question as far as the statement goes is:
Do we want to leave in “and protect against production disruptions”?
MS.
MINEHAN.
Yes, right.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
I don’t think we need that.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The sentence is very long.
Let me read it and see whether or not we need that phrase.
“Although the necessary…” Do we want to say “reallocation” or “diversion”?
SEVERAL.
“Reallocation.” 11/6/01 96 VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
“Reallocation” is more positive.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
“Although the necessary reallocation of resources to enhance security is likely to detract from measured advances in productivity for a time, the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.” MS. MINEHAN.
Did you keep in “advances in productivity” or did you say “measured productivity”?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The first reference is to measured productivity.
The second one is to true productivity growth so I would leave the word “measured” out.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
Yes.
MS.
MINEHAN.
<START>But one could argue, along the lines that President Jordan did, that the actual productivity of the U.S.<END>
economy is better because of what might have been looked at as overhead expenditures on clean air and clean water.
This reallocation of resources may turn out not to be a terrible development.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Let me tell you what the problem is.
<START>If we’re going to get into this, we’ve got a serious problem, which is whether in fact we’re measuring efficiency or improvements in the quality of our standard of living.<END>
MS.
MINEHAN.
Right.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Environmental and other types of controls do not increase efficiency.
They improve the quality of life.
Measured productivity is efficiency.
MS.
MINEHAN.
The improved quality of life could make the overall labor force more efficient.
11/6/01 97 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
It’s conceivable, but that’s not what is being measured.
One way of looking at it is that a lot of activities basically don’t benefit us because they are in some sense protective.
A big chunk of medical expenditures falls into that category;
it depends on whether the expense is for preventive or curative purposes.
What I’m trying to get at here is that this involves a very serious conceptual problem.
MS.
MINEHAN.
I know.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
We don’t want to get into that.
MS.
MINEHAN.
No, we don’t.
But I also don’t think we want to come out with a statement that could be interpreted negatively.
Granted, there are a zillion different sophisticated arguments one can make about why this statement is true.
I still think the public interpretation of it will be negative with regard to security.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Can we say “the appropriate reallocation of resources”?
I made the statement in testimony to Congress in very much this way.
I got very positive responses.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
Absolutely.
I dispute the major premise here, which is that it’s negative.
I don’t find it negative for the Federal Reserve to say that investment in security is a good thing, which is in my view what we’re saying.
I absolutely fail to see how that’s negative.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Well, maybe it’s just an interpretation.
I think investment in security is a good thing right now.
That’s what we need.
MR.
REINHART.
Mr. Chairman, if you wanted to appear more neutral, the verb “detracts” may also seem negative.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Yes.
11/6/01 98 MR. REINHART.
So if instead it said “is likely to slow the advance in measured productivity” I think that would pretty much go in the direction of neutrality.
MR.
BROADDUS.
I think that’s very good.
I’d suggest the language “ restrain advances in productivity,” which is shorter and less awkward.
<START>may How about “may restrain advances in near-term measurements of productivity.” VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.<END>
MS.
MINEHAN.
You’re on a roll, Al!
[Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Let’s do it.
MR.
PARRY.
“ restrain advances?” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
May Let me reread it.
Yes, in that context we don’t really need measured.
“Although the”--do you want to say necessary or appropriate?
SPEAKER(?).
“Appropriate.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
<START>“Although the appropriate reallocation of resources to enhance security may restrain advances in productivity for a time, the long-term prospects” etc. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.<END>
Great.
MS.
MINEHAN.
That’s shorter.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I think that does it.
SPEAKER(?).
All right!
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
May I just ask a question?
In the second paragraph, third line, is the phrase “for the foreseeable future” new in this statement?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
No, it’s part of the boilerplate.
MR.
MOSKOW.
We had it in previous statements?
11/6/01 99 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Oh yes, it’s part of the boilerplate.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
We’ve had that in our statements since the Ferguson Committee came up with it.
MR.
MEYER.
It’s in a slightly different location in this statement, but we always use it.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Okay?
MR.
MOSKOW.
Fine.
MR.
KOHN.
Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that the Committee reconsider using the word “necessary” to describe the reallocation of resources rather than “appropriate”?
Several people suggested “necessary” during the course of the discussion and I think it may be a little better there.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I think that’s a good suggestion.
Is that okay with everybody?
SEVERAL.
Yes.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I didn’t think we could rewrite the press statement as a Committee, but we did!
The next meeting is December 11, 2001.
We adjourn for lunch.
