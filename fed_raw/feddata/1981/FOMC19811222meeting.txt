We can come to order and approve the minutes.    MR. SCHULTZ.  So moved.    SPEAKER(?).  Second.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  With a motion and a second we will approve the minutes, if there are no objections.  Then we will have a report on foreign currency operations or the lack thereof.    MR. CROSS.  [Statement--see Appendix.]    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any comments or questions?    MR. GUFFEY.  I'd just like to ask this:  You mentioned that we had authority to intervene.  Authority from whom?    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What was the question?    MR. CROSS.  The question was:  From where did the authority come to intervene?  The New York Federal Reserve Bank was instructed by the Chairman on the basis of discussions between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.    MS. TEETERS.  What were the terms that the Treasury agreed to for us to begin [intervening]?    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, we would have intervened if the [mark] had continued to weaken.  I am sorry I missed whatever you said Sam, but we would [unintelligible].  After the Polish declaration of martial law, the mark was very weak and then it strengthened relative to [its level] in the Far East.  We would have intervened if it had retreated rapidly again after having strengthened at around the 2.30 level or a little lower, [unintelligible].    MR. CROSS.  The mark hit a peak in the Far Eastern trading of about 2.36-1/2 and the rates in terms of the other [currencies] were similar.  But in terms of DM it went down to about 2.33 when Europe began its operations.  Also, the Japanese intervened in their market. Then as the European markets opened there was intervention by the German authorities and also some profit-taking and the rate continued to come down to 2.30.  And then in the middle of the morning here it was down to about 2.28.  So, during the entire period when our markets were open, the rates were coming back into balance and the pressures were subsiding.  But we had the authority to step in had the movement gone the other way and had it looked as though the rates were beginning to spurt back up with the dollar getting stronger and the mark and yen and other currencies weakening.  But we did not use the authority.    MS. TEETERS.  Did the Treasury say in any specific way what   it considered a disorderly market?  Did they say a certain percentage change or something like that would be--    VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well, as Paul said, there was a feeling on that midmorning that if the mark reversed itself and the dollar weakened--the mark was up to about 2.29 or 2.30--then it might be appropriate [to intervene], depending on the conditions at that moment.  But that was in the context of the reaction to the Polish move.  I don't think that the Treasury or even you have a view as to what rate change [constitutes a disorderly market], devoid of the context in which the rate change comes about, unless maybe it comes about very abruptly.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Where's the rate now?    MR. CROSS.  2.28.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I still think that was fairly abrupt.    VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But we have had bigger moves than that.    MR. CROSS.  The market has been quite unsettled all week.  On Friday the rate in terms of DM again--I hate to keep talking about that one, but it is convenient--hit 2.30 in the European markets.  It started at 2.27-1/2 on the previous trading day, went up to 2.30, and came back down to 2.27-1/2 during our trading day.  Then after the money supply figures were announced, it went up to 2.28-1/4 roughly. So there was an awful lot of movement during many of these days.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  My sense is that this market has been a very poor market--let me put it that way--right through this period. Is that still correct?    MR. CROSS.  That's correct.  It has been a very thin market, particularly coming as it does near the end of the year when we are told that not only the banks but the corporations are interested in getting their books cleaned up and don't want to take new positions and so forth.  There are not many operators out there making markets, so if anybody has something that he has to do in terms of business, it seems to move the rate by quite a substantial amount with a relatively small amount of activity.  I would agree with you that the markets have been quite unsettled.    VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The markets attribute that to our policy of nonintervention.  In fact, I gather at the Federal Advisory Council meeting you had in November that all the banks represented on that Council criticized the nonintervention policy.  At least that is what Don Platten told me.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I guess I said something.  I forget exactly what they said.    MR. PARTEE.  It wasn't that much.    MR. SCHULTZ.  Yes, it wasn't severe criticism.    MR. TRUMAN.  My memory is that he said there was 12/21-22/81-2-  disagreement among the banks.  He presented a view which said that [the FAC members] suspect this [nonintervention policy] has something to do with [the market unsettlement] but there are banks that have other views.  That is also my memory of the written report that they made to the Board at the time.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But when we asked them, the Federal Advisory Committee members did say that banks not under the FAC might have other views.  I guess that is the way it was.  As I recall, that comment was in their written report but they weren't violent about it.    MR. SCHULTZ.  As a matter of fact, they also said that there was some general agreement that intervention policy should be used sparingly or something like that.  I didn't get the feeling that they had a strong position on that.  That's my recollection.  I didn't think it was a very vitriolic comment.    VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It is always interesting to hear two people report a conversation.    MR. PARTEE.  That is what I was thinking.  He thought he delivered a strong message and we didn't even hear it!    VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  That is what he told us [in New York].    MR. SCHULTZ.  Is my recollection wrong?    MR. PARTEE.  I can hardly remember [what was said].    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I'd forgotten it.  But it did come up and I guess they did put in their written report a positive recommendation that we ought to intervene.  They were not frothing at the mouth about it, but it was a positive recommendation.  I asked whether that view was generally held and they said they thought it was by a lot people, but not everybody.  And that was the extent of it.    MS. TEETERS.  What I'm trying to find out is:  Do we have some general guidelines from the Treasury as to when we intervene or don't intervene that you can speak to?    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't know what you mean by general guidelines.  We always have this problem.  There is nothing I can recite that is good in all seasons.  We developed this interim guideline following the Polish [action], that if [the dollar] took a sudden jump up beyond where it was [against the mark], in essence we'd intervene.  That was after the dollar had already gone up; it was already up about 4 percent from where it had been trading.    MR. WALLICH.  At least it wasn't that an assassination attempt was needed to intervene.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We're developing case studies.  We intervene on assassinations and military takeovers!    MR. GRAMLEY.  Or we stand ready to intervene.  12/21-22/81-3-12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, actually what happened is that wewere quite ready to intervene and at the time I thought it wouldprobably be necessary. But in every one of these occasions recentlythe rate has reached its nadir in European trading rather than in theUnited States. So every time we've gotten geared up to do something,the rates have come off the peak or off the floor.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, people know what Beryl Sprinkeland Don Regan mean by a crisis and, therefore, they probably expectsome intervention. That is obviously clear and, therefore, maybe thatis one reason the rates are--MS. TEETERS. Or the Germans do it ahead of us, or for us.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that is what has been happening.MR. CROSS. Both the Germans and the Japanese intervenedduring this latest spate of activities.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The Japanese intervened very heavily.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We reserve the right to intervene when wefind it necessary. Sometimes our patience is more strained than atother times. We also want to cooperate if possible. And we have beencooperating, I guess. We have nothing to approve here. Norecommendations?MR. WINN. The other Polish problem is their debt. Do wehave any feeling at all on when that will start to come to a head?MR. CROSS. Well, I don't know when it is going to come to ahead. The banks were supposed to enter into an agreement, a priorcondition of which was that they should receive the arrears. But theydidn't receive the interest in arrears. They received a telegramasking if they could make $350 million of loans available. The lastwe heard is that the banks were talking to each other about what todo. But there does not seem to be, at least among the people we talkto, any great disposition to provide more money to the Poles.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The Poles [were given] a rather clearmessage just a couple days before martial law was imposed. Theycalculated that they owed about $350 million of interest. They didnot have $350 million. So, [they were told] they could pay theinterest for 3 or 6 months, and then the rest of the agreement couldgo into effect.MR. CROSS. They requested what they called a bridge loan.Some of [the banks] thought it looked more like a pier than a bridge.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that situation is very much up inthe air. I find it a little difficult to see that anything is goingto be done unless the Russians give them money to pay the debt and paythe interest between now and the end of the year. I don't think theywill last.MR. WINN. The end of the year is the due date, is it?12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, there was a date earlier inDecember, but now the end of the year is critical in that if [thelenders] don't get paid by the end of the year, then they will have toadmit that the loan is in default--or at least that it isquestionable--on the day that they have to make up their books for theend of the year and decide what to do about it.MR. TRUMAN. Most of the interest started to be in arrears onMarch 26.MR. CROSS. This covers three-fourths of the year. The banksand the Poles were supposed to meet on December 28, I think, to signthe agreement; and they wanted the payment cleaned up two weeks early,which was December 14, so they wouldn't sit down at a table and not beable to sign. But that day passed and the payments weren't made.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The banks had told their committeesbefore the takeover that if the Poles did pay the interest,sympathetic consideration--that was the term they used--would be givento some new short-term trade credits of 60 to 90 days. Not all thebanks would do that, but that was the language they agreed on if thePoles didn't default. And then everything got overtaken. Nothingprobably would have happened anyway, but any chance of a solutionbeing reached certainly got wiped out temporarily by that takeover.So, everybody is in disarray. I don't know how many banks are goingto move to increase their loan loss write-offs. I checked around butnobody that I am aware of has done more than 50 percent as write-offs.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wasn't aware anybody had done that much.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. A couple of banks said that they hadincreased their loan loss reserves by 50 percent of the Polish loans.MR. WALLICH. They might have to proceed differently withrespect to the 1981 maturities that should have been rescheduled butnow have fallen through. They might have to write off 50 or even 100percent. But most of it, of course, is into the future.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Sternlight.MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix.]MR. STERNLIGHT. Mr. Chairman, if I may, I also have arecommendation to make: namely, that the leeway for changes inholdings in the System Account, which the Committee voted to enlargeto the $4 billion level, be left at that $4 billion level up to thetime of the next meeting. Our projections make it look as though wemight need to absorb something like $3 billion of reserves duringJanuary, essentially reversing much of that seasonal need that we metin the last several weeks. That concludes my remarks, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any comments?MS. TEETERS. You used up $3.8 billion of the $4 billion? Isthat right, Peter?MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes, and we may have done another $150million today because we took some notes from one foreign account.12/21-22/81MS. TEETERS. Don't you feel you need a little more leeway onthat? You are pretty short at this point, aren't you?MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, the leeway needed to last only throughtoday or tomorrow, so we were willing to run it right up to the line.After this meeting a new leeway is established. We may have a littlemore to add on an outright basis but as soon as we get into Januarywe'll have to swing around the other way. It is to provide the leewayfor a possibly large move in the other direction, a large absorptionof reserves, that I think it might be useful to leave that limit atthe $4 billion level.MS. TEETERS. The $4 billion runs from when to when?MR. STERNLIGHT. It would run, I believe, from the day afterthis meeting--that would be Wednesday--through February 2.MS. TEETERS. So you get a new $4 billion starting tomorrow.MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes.MR. ALTMANN. It's $3 billion unless the Committee approvesthis.MS. TEETERS. It's $3 billion. Oh, I see what you mean.MR. BOEHNE. Is there any thought in the market that thestrengthening in the money supply we've seen recently is due more tothe economy perhaps being not as weak as we thought versus the Fedmaking an overt attempt to pump up the money supply? Is there anysense of that?MR. STERNLIGHT. I think there's some puzzlement about thestrength that market analysts have seen. I don't have any sense thatthey are associating it with the economy being stronger. Some of themsee other special reasons; some have the same sort of temporaryparking place idea that we've kicked around here.MR. BOEHNE. A precautionary type--MR. STERNLIGHT. A precautionary [move to] higher savingsrates. There are varying estimates about the strength of the economy,but I haven't really gotten much sense of people relating theaggregates to that.MR. BOEHNE. Well, it is a strange bulge for this part of arecession. It's out of character for this stage of a recession.MR. ROOS. The Bluebook made reference to an anticipatedreduction in the rate of money growth for the last part of December.Does that appear to be probable?MR. STERNLIGHT. A lot of people in the market expect thatalso. Steve might want to comment on the particular Bluebookreference.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We look forward to it with our usualconviction.-6-12/21-22/81MR. AXILROD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.MR. ROOS. I didn't get an answer, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The answer is: Nobody knows.MR. AXILROD. Two independent staffs within the FederalReserve System are projecting a decline of varying magnitude. So,that might add a little to [one's conviction].MR. STERNLIGHT. The New York staff has a little more of adrop.MS. TEETERS. Have you both been wrong before?MR. AXILROD and CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Maybe you can get a better answer ifyou ask why they are projecting that, Larry. At least when I've askedthat specifically, the answer is: Because it has gone up so fast, itought to slow down.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are there any other questions that canhave equally enlightening answers? No other comments? We have aproposal on raising the [intermeeting] limit to $4 billion. Is thatacceptable? Hearing no objections--MS. TEETERS. Is it symmetrical, plus or minus?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. That is accepted. We need to ratifythe operations. Without objection we will ratify the operations. Onmy agenda I have next the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregatesand then the economic situation. It seems to me that it may be alittle better to take up the economic situation first. If that seemsmore logical to other people, we will call upon you first, Mr.Kichline. Did I decide on the other order when we made up the agenda?MR. KICHLINE. I was prepared, though. [Statement--seeAppendix.] I might note that the CPI should be available tomorrowmorning. And, unfortunately, new orders figures will be availabletomorrow afternoon.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm just looking at the Greenbook. It hasnational defense spending declining every quarter. Is that correct?MR. KICHLINE. That's been corrected in the errata. I thinkwe reversed the lines for that and the state and local sector. Stateand local spending was shown to be rising each and every quarter andthat should be negative. Those lines, unfortunately, were reversed.MS. TEETERS. But the state and local sector is approximatelydouble the size or more of the defense sector, so those declines instate and local are quite substantial, of course, in real terms.MR. KICHLINE. Yes, they are.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You said you assumed that retailsales would be going up somewhat nominally both this month and in12/21-22/81January. The executive of a leading national retail chain said to methat they think the reasonably satisfactory pre-Christmas sales arethe last gasp and that there is going to be a major fall in retailsales in January. They had a poor October-November. Since thenthey've done reasonably well with all these sales; they ran a 12percent increase in nominal terms. But they expect January to beextremely poor, for what it is worth. Generally speaking, thebusiness CEOs I've been speaking with, as distinguished from thefinancial CEOs, are much gloomier and expect a greater-than-averagerecession and, some of them [are especially gloomy]. I'm not talkingabout the interest rate sensitive industries but, for example, carloadings on the railroads. The head of one of those railway outfitssaid that it was the worst he'd seen in--I forget the period of time--many, many years; it was worse than in the 1974-75 drop. There is alot of gloom and doom in the business community, whereas I think inthe financial community there is an assumption that the recession willbe more or less an average one.MR. SCHULTZ. I'd be interested to know what people arehearing about the labor situation. Jim puts together some tables onwage concessions, every week or so I guess, and they are lengthening.I was on the plane Friday with a fellow who recently retired as headof one of the major trucking companies, and he said that a lot of theTeamster locals are likely to go with just a cost of living increasebecause the competition is just tremendous and, indeed, a lot ofunionized trucking companies look as if they are not going to make it.What kind of noises do you hear as you talk to CEOs?MR. BOEHNE. I hear throughout my District a sense that labornegotiations are not going to be as tough--that there will beconcessions and that there may even be some inroads into cost ofliving indices. But as far as the outlook goes, what I hear is thatthey think the unemployment rate is going to go higher than in theGreenbook forecast. I hear more and more stories of lay-offs; and itis that fear of lay-offs that I think is affecting the climate inwhich these wage negotiations are taking place. I share Tony's viewthat there seems to be more pessimism in the manufacturing area thanin the retail and financial areas, but what I get is uncertainty. Weare in the phase of the business cycle where there is a downward slideand nobody has a good feeling about whether that slide is going toaccelerate or taper off. There is a feeling that the economy willrecover in the middle of the year, but I would guess the sentiment isthat the recession will be average to worse. And that, too, iscontributing to a more favorable [climate for] wage negotiations.MS. TEETERS. Are you going to report a lot of plantclosings?MR. BOEHNE. I wouldn't say a lot more than we are used to inmy part of the country, but I am hearing of more cutbacks in the workforce in the plants that are operating--not outright shutdowns but[reductions of] 450 here and 800 there. It is very common [to hearsuch reports] in talking to people and they are very common in thenewspapers and radio reports. And it seems to be widespread; it iseven happening in parts of our District where they usually don't feelrecession as much. There is a part of Pennsylvania that is generallyfairly insulated from that, and reports from there are about aspessimistic as elsewhere. So, it seems to be very widespread.12/21-22/81MR. PARTEE. Eastern Pennsylvania you mean?MR. BOEHNE. There is an area around Lancaster andHarrisburg, the South Central area, where generally the unemploymentrate is well under the national average. We have a director fromArmstrong Cork in that area and he says that even Lancaster is feelingit this time around and they usually don't feel it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.MR. KEEHN. On the specific question--I'll comment [on mygeneral views] later--I think there has been within the last 30 to 45days a decided shift on the part of labor out our way. Their focus isnow shifting from concentration on the financial aspects of thepackage to the job per se. For example, the UAW has indicated awillingness to reopen the auto workers contract; the Teamsters havereopened [their contract] and the trucking people that I talk toexpect some significant concessions there. The UAW has specificallysaid they will reopen the Harvester contract; there they are going totry to get rid of the last increase that was given in October andthere is going to be a discussion about the COLA increase coming up inthe next couple of months as well as the pension increase that isscheduled for April. Harvester expects to get a hundred milliondollars a year out of the renegotiation the union has authorized. Iwould echo Tony's comments; the industrial CEOs I have talked to areextremely gloomy and are expecting a very difficult 1982--a far deeperrecession than most of the financial people I've talked to anticipate.Therefore, I think they are going to go into negotiations with atougher attitude than they might have had six or eight months ago. Ithink there has been a big change on that front.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. On the other hand, notwithstandingwhat I said earlier, I was talking with Citibank's board of directorslast week and I went around the table and asked them what wagesettlements each plant expected to make. I was surprised that everysingle man at that table who headed a large company said between 9 and9-1/2 percent.MR. WALLICH. Were they unionized?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Most of them were unionized. Butwhen I asked them if they had any plants that were nonunion, becausesome of them were very [diversified], they said it didn't make thatmuch difference in their company as a matter of policy. Quite a fewsaid, however, that they expected some productivity increases and thatthe net increase in labor cost might come in around 7 percent.MR. SCHULTZ. I have a comment on work rules. When JohnSagan was here for the Conference of Chairmen, he indicated that atone Ford plant where they had 44 work rules they had gotten the numberdown to 6 or something like that. There were some major changes inthe work rules which he thought was really significant. Are youhearing that kind of noise too?MR. CORRIGAN. Yes. The scope of the cutbacks that GeneralMotors announced on Friday for their white collar workers was ratherastonishing. They are freezing pay, cutting back vacations from six12/21-22/81weeks to two weeks, and putting in a major cost-sharing provision intheir medical insurance programs--all three at once.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But where the threat is clearlycoming from imports in addition to the depressed economy, they tell memanagement has a much stronger case in getting labor to--MR. CORRIGAN. Well, obviously, in this case they chose to dothe [cutbacks of] white collar workers with a view toward trying toinfluence the [labor union] negotiations. But doing that kind ofthing for 150,000 white collar workers is a big, big bite.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But I think there is going to be asignificant divergence in the wage settlement between manufacturingand service industries.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wonder whether this kind of thing isever reflected in the statistics.MR. GRAMLEY. Well, some of this is showing up now. There ismuch more improvement in manufacturing wage increases this year thananywhere else. That is where the big improvement has come; it's inthe average hourly earnings index.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is right. I don't see much in thenonmanufacturing area. I was talking to some bankers out in Chicagoand they were all reporting that they have in their plans 11 percentor more for wage increases. I think they are a little behind thetimes, but so it is. Any other comment while we are on the subject?Let's remain on this subject for a moment. Does anybody else haveanything?SPEAKER(?). It's a form of rational expectations--that is,the expectation that your employer may go bankrupt.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They wait for that expectation until he ispractically on the edge. That is true.MS. TEETERS. Actually, Frank, the capacity utilization inthis [forecast] doesn't get down to where it was in 1974. It bottomsout at 73 percent and in 1974 it was 69 percent.MR. MORRIS. I thought the chart in the Greenbook showed thatwe are already down to--MR. SCHULTZ. No, I think Nancy's right.MR. FORD. There is a revision that was passed out. Did yousee this here?MR. MORRIS. This is a revised one. It says capacityutilization, total manufacturing--MR. SCHULTZ. That is for 1980, you see. Look back to the--MR. MORRIS. All right. Okay.-10-12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comment on the wage cost/pricesituation?MR. KEEHN. I think there have been some developments on theprice side as well. There is the price cutting in retail; withChristmas sales it is hard to tell how it is going to work out butthere are clearly some price cuts there. In the automotive industryit has been demonstrated that when the manufacturers go to rebates,etc., that kind of price [cutting] tends to bring higher levels ofsales, and I think [price cutbacks] are beginning to [reach] back intothe raw materials. There is a very big overhang internationally inaluminum ingots, for example; the book price, I think, is 74 cents apound and the trades are taking place at about 49 cents a pound. Sothere's a very appreciable difference in some of the raw materialsareas, which ultimately ought to show up. So I think there has beenprogress on that front as well.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are commodity prices still declining? Ihaven't looked at that for a couple of weeks.MR. KICHLINE. Yes they are, but much less than they had beenearlier.MR. GRAMLEY. For raw industrial commodities, we are now backto something like [the level of] the middle of 1978.MR. KICHLINE. Right.MS. TEETERS. Jim, will the CPI pick up the pre-Christmassales?MR. [KICHLINE]?. This next one?MS. TEETERS. Yes, the December CPI. Do they have a way of[measuring] the widespread sales that are taking place?MR. KICHLINE. Well, they are supposed to take into accountactual transactions prices, but there is a question as to how wellthey can do that. The report tomorrow is going to be for November, soin any event we wouldn't be picking up what is happening now untillater in January.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that exhausts our wisdom on wages andprices, is there any other comment on the business outlook generally?MR. WALLICH. In the midst of this gloom, there is onesubstantial difference and that is that a major tax cut is already onthe books. I think this lends a certain support to the [expectation]not in the first quarter, but looking to the second and thirdquarters, that the economy is going to come--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Isn't there a law that when everybodyexpects an upturn--if it looks unanimous--it isn't going to happen?MR. PARTEE. I have a few butterflies about it myself.MR. CORRIGAN. In terms of the business picture, this is abit of an outlier observation, but some of the business types that I-11-12/21-22/81have been talking to, in the Minneapolis area at least, clearly arealready at the point where they are looking across the valley. Evenfrom the nonfinancial types I don't get that sense of gloom that Mr.Solomon and Mr. Boehne are picking up. I think there is a recognitionthat we have had a very, very steep decline; but they are alreadyclearly looking out to what they think is going to be a very strongsecond half of next year.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There is a widespread feeling amongbusinessmen--they all volunteer it--that we have a dualistic economy:that people are lucky to be in the service sector because they aren'tgoing to have it very tough. The head of IBM was telling me thatbusiness is absolutely booming. They make a distinction between wageincreases in the service sector as against the manufacturing sector.It is the manufacturing people and the people who ship the bulky stuffwho are talking about how serious they think the current situation is.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What does Texas say, Mr. Boykin?MR. BOYKIN. I reported at our last meeting that there seemedto be a slight slowdown in the energy area, particularly in drillingactivity. I'm told now that that has reversed. There were two rigsin the pen last time but those are out. They tell me that has turnedaround a little, although they are expecting a bit of a slowdown inthe rate of increase for 1982. In the manufacturing end, we reallydon't have all that much [change]; but in the semiconductor business,which is a large employer, they are taking an extended Christmasholiday. They are shutting down until January 11. The agriculturalarea, though, is an area of concern. As we know, the prices to thefarmers are not good; the crops have been very good. We are told thatour agricultural banks probably are going to have to carry over morefarmers than they ever have. And they can probably carry them thisyear, but without some improvement there are going to be some veryserious liquidation problems.MR. SCHULTZ. Let me ask you a [question]. The loan/depositratios in agricultural banks, remember, had been pretty high in thespring of 1980, at about 68 percent nationally. When we looked atthem here not too long ago, a couple months ago, they were down to 60percent. Are your banks pretty much in that same situation--thattheir loan/deposit ratios are pretty good? Do they have plenty ofroom to make loans if they want to make them and carry them over?MR. BOYKIN. Yes, they have the room. But the question ishow comfortable they feel, even though they have the money, about howlong can they stay with [agricultural borrowers] in the expectation ofa repayment because of the price problem.MR. SCHULTZ. What about the land prices? Again, looking atthe places where most of the problem loans tend to be, people hadgotten pretty extended on land. Are you beginning to see a break inyour land prices?MR. BOYKIN. I think so, a break in the sense that the salesof farm lands are going down. I have heard of a few instances of alittle price concession, but there is not a lot moving right now.-12-12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is the story I hear when people fromfarm areas talk to me: that there isn't much movement in the pricebut there sure aren't any sales, and don't try that price too hard.MR. KEEHN. In our District, when land that was valued at$3500 to $4000 an acre comes up for sale, the price goes down; andthey pull it off the market at $2700 or $2800 an acre. The price justdoesn't clear the market.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roos.MR. ROOS. Obviously, things are relatively slow in ourDistrict, but I think it is important to remember that part of it canbe attributed to the rather abrupt drop in the rate of money growthduring most of this year. As we look ahead into what next year willbring, especially the second half of next year, it is awfullyimportant to keep in mind--unless I am the only one in this group whosees it this way--that the decisions we make this afternoon andtomorrow will have a direct bearing. They will have even a greaterbearing than what recent conversations with people in business mightindicate for the future. If we choose to set targets that imply afaster rate of money growth than we are presently experiencing, we areinevitably going to have a step-up in economic activity after a fewmonths. So, what we do will have a direct bearing, at least as welook at it, rather than just psychological [effects on] decisions thatbusinessmen might be making.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Winn.MR. WINN. There are more than the Polish loans out therethat are in trouble. The insurance industry reports a considerableincrease in the amount of problem loans. Our Canadian friends havecome down and done a big real estate investment without taking outfinancing, so some of the office building complexes are in a peculiarstatus at the moment, and they may be coming on the market. My guessis that the building boom has about run its course--well, it may goanother year--but that office space is starting to show up as a littleon the heavy side across the country.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ford.MR. FORD. On some of the points you have mentioned, in ourend of the so-called Sun Belt things are not really all that sunny.Specifically, for example, on Nancy's point about the pre-sales in theretail area, we are definitely seeing a whole lot of that. We have 45board members in our District and a number of them are retailers; theyhave been telling us that their sales are flat to down in real terms.They may have a nominal increase in dollar sales, but a lot of that iscoming on white sales that were taking place in December and Novemberinstead of in January and later. So, they are a little depressedabout that. The tenants in the large Atlanta malls are concernedabout their inventories being high and are having to do heavypromotions to keep their sales up. On the employment side, we areseeing some rather heavy layoffs in the more industrialized areas ofour District, particularly in the housing-related carpet industry. Weproduce half the carpets in the United States in northern Georgia andthey have experienced a 50 percent drop in production in the last fewmonths. So, we are seeing big problems there. Some of our major-13-12/21-22/81employers, like Fruehof in Florida and even Excel in Orlando and theFord glass plant in Nashville, are all laying off big chunks of theirlabor force. In the service industries, which someone else askedabout, we are finding some problems. Air Florida, one of the morerobust regional airlines, has had a very heavy cutback on itsemployment, as some of you may have noticed in the newspapers. So, weare seeing pretty much across the board in both the service and themanufacturing industries that the recession is deepening throughoutour area. In some of the [most depressed] parts, in Alabama in theindustrialized areas, we have unemployment rates approaching 12 to 13percent. They are a little [higher] than the northern version inDetroit and that area. So, we are seeing the recession come down inthe Southeast pretty heavily.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Refresh my memory, Mr. Kichline, if youcan. In the 1974-75 recession did wage rate increases actually comedown appreciably?MR. KICHLINE. Immediately after, as I remember--in 1975 and1976--there was a sharp break in wages, and prices also came downsubstantially.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I know prices did; I couldn'tremember how much wages did.MR. WALLICH. They never had risen that much. Inflation hadnot become imbedded in ways that--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand that, too. I really don'tknow whether--MR. GRAMLEY. When we removed the wage and price controls inthe spring of 1974, what happened immediately thereafter was a catchupburst of wages. If you look at a chart on wage rates, they wererocketing upward and then the rate of increase came way, way down.But a very large part of that reduction in the rate of increase inwages was nothing more than a termination of the round of wageincreases that ensued after the wage and price controls were removed.So, you can't look back at the 1974-75 experience.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Wage and price controls were removed inthe spring of--?MR. GRAMLEY. April 1974.MR. BOEHNE. There were a number of phases, I think. Thefinal phase came off in 1974.MR. PARTEE. There was a holdback on big companies thatextended to the spring of 1974.MR. GRAMLEY. As I remember, by about the third quarter of1975 the annual rate of wage increase got up to around the 12 to 14percent range. There was actually an acceleration of wage increasesduring the recession. It wasn't until afterwards, once the recessionwas over, that it began coming down; then we began to get the bigdownward adjustment in the rate of increases in wages.-14-12/21-22/81MR. SCHULTZ. Do you have numbers down there, Mr. Kichline?MR. KICHLINE. We have some numbers. Unfortunately, they areannual numbers. On an annual basis 1975 still showed an increase and1976 is the big year where there is a break. I would agree withGovernor Gramley that the whole period is confused; I think part ofthe controls were off in 1973, and in 1974 we began to see theacceleration of wages when we were in that recession.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A bunch of the controls came off in early1973; I remember that very well. I remember very well when I thoughtthe great bulk of them were sneaking off in January of 1973.MR. PARTEE. Employers with 5,000 or more--MR. KICHLINE. It was continued on large firms as I remember.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't even remember that. What werethose annual numbers just for the heck of it?MR. KICHLINE. In 1973 the average hourly earnings index hada 6.1 percent increase; in 1974, 8.0 percent; in 1975, 8.3 percent;and in 1976, 7.2 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So it was just a 1 percent decline eventhen?MR. KICHLINE. Right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Then it went up again or held steady or--MR. KICHLINE. It began edging up.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. It used to be that second perhaps only to Texas,the West was fairly recession proof, but that doesn't seem to be thecase today. Looking around for some elements of strength, I have beenhard pressed to put my finger on them. Alaska is the only one of ournine states that still seems to be adding to payrolls. Nonresidentialconstruction, which has been very strong, is still above a year agobut the growth is definitely slowing. And across a wide range ofareas there is developing weakness or a going downhill, even in theaerospace industry, on balance, strangely enough. Lockheed justannounced getting out of the production of the 1011. They are hopingto pick up something in defense orders. The semiconductor high-techbusiness that had such a strong growth trend has turned sour. Some ofthe semi-conductor firms from Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the Westare having extended shutdowns because of excessive inventories. EvenBoeing, which has a huge share of the commercial airline market, isgetting increasing numbers of cancellations. There is morecompetition from the Airbus, etc., and even though they are rollingout a couple of new models in the very near future--the 767 is aboutto come out and the 757 is expected a year later--their sales aredefinitely down and so is their employment. So, it is hard to see thebottom being reached in the near future. The trend is still downwardacross a pretty broad front.-15-12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.MR. GRAMLEY. [I'd say] that, if anything, we are likely togo through a recession this time which is worse, or somewhat worse atleast, than the average postwar decline. We are talking aboutsomething that is quite pervasive and quite deep. If memory servesme, the average postwar decline in real GNP is about 2-1/2 percent.What we are looking at is a forecast of about a 2 percent decline,which is a milder recession than the average in the postwar period.Now, recessions come in all different sizes, so this is still aclassic recession; there's no question about that. But I have a hunchthat if things work out differently--and they always work out somewhatdifferently than anybody expects--the area I worry about thathappening in is business fixed investment. And I think Mr. Kichlineis right that if we are in for a surprise there, it will be a surprisein which the drop in business fixed investment is significantly worsethan the decline of about 4 percent we are now forecasting. I thinkbusinessmen are very, very pessimistic for a variety of reasons. Oneis that they look for a future of real interest rates that potentiallywill stay up at extremely high levels because of huge deficits in thefederal budget. And they are pessimistic because they have beenthrough a 2- to 3-year period in which each time the economy hasgotten off the ground it has gotten slugged in the head again and goneright back down. They are pessimistic because they are looking atvery, very low levels of capacity utilization. And they arepessimistic because in some areas of the country we have had such[economic] devastation. So, I think we are going to see a bigger dropin business-fixed investment than this [forecast]. We are likely tosee a first quarter that looks very, very bad--considerably worse thanwhat we are now forecasting--and it may stretch out into the secondquarter before we begin seeing things turn up again.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. Well, I guess the tone of the conversation isgetting a little too gloomy for me. I would remind you that we arehaving the largest tax cut in the postwar history of the country.That will be taking effect in stages over a period of time. Henryreferred to the 10 percent cut next June 30. In addition, there is asizable relaxation that occurs as of January 1, just a few days away,for a wide range of activities that well could have a little moreoomph in them as a result of the change in tax treatment. I wouldpoint out that housing is very low. I suppose [starts] could dropfrom 800,000 to zero--well, to 500,000 or something like that--but thedownside risk can't be very large at this level. Nor can domestic carsales go very much below the [recent pace of] 5 million for very long,given the fact that people still need cars in order to drive. Andinventories of cars on the road are depreciating and the stock, assomebody said, is declining. Fred, I think you mentioned that adecline in the stock of cars is occurring. So, some of the areas thatare customarily sources of weakness can't be that much of a source ofweakness from this point on, in my view.I'd rather agree with Lyle that there is some exposure inplant and equipment. We were talking about that this morning, and Iwould be inclined to think that there might be a little larger declineand perhaps a good deal larger decline than the staff has in itsforecast. But again, for every inch that you give there, the less-16-12/21-22/81pressure there is on financial markets and money markets. And itseems to me that we can almost, with a little lag, get a substitutionof housing for plant and equipment if in fact we get that muchweakness in the system. Also, this Christmas of 1981 is not good but,on the other hand, it is not just abysmal. Let us not be too gloomy;we ought to get a recovery, I think, sometime in 1982.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't want to [catch] you unawares, Mr.Truman, but it might be appropriate for you to say just a word aboutwhat is going on abroad.MR. TRUMAN. Okay.MR. SCHULTZ. To give you a little more time, would you liketo have a filibuster?MR. WALLICH. Do you need your pipe?MR. SCHULTZ. You just let the cat out of the bag, Henry!MR. TRUMAN. The picture is broadly similar to what we haveseen here in the sense that the economies abroad have been growing,although it has been small positive growth. It has been quite modeston average over the last several quarters. There have been some signsof a bottoming out: There were increases in the United Kingdom aftera very sharp decline; and the German GNP number that came in for thethird quarter, just released today finally on a seasonally adjustedbasis that one could understand, shows essentially zero growth ratherthan negative [as it was] in the second quarter. So, there are somesigns of a bottoming out, though I think we have marked down theextent to which we see real positive growth in this quarter. Weexpect at best only a modest rate of acceleration in the course of1982, reaching something on the order of 2-1/2 percent on average as Irecall for the last half of 1982. That is hardly a very robustperformance, when you factor in Japan, which in the past, even in thefirst oil-shock environment, has had a fairly good growth raterelative to the rest of us.Generally speaking, unemployment is expected to continue torise abroad; and there may be some improvement--maybe a percentagepoint or a little more--on the price side but not any rapid expansion.One place where we have seen some shift in policies, or at least inthat direction relative to everybody else, is France, where a somewhatrapid pickup is expected in both prices and real growth. I mightcomment that Japan in particular seems to be a serious problem. Theyhad about 4 percent growth this year, which looks good from ourperspective, but even the official authorities are not looking for toomuch next year, which clearly is one of the things that is causing theproblem on the external side, the current account side. They justhave very weak domestic demands, and that combined with the decline ininternational commodity prices--imports are weighted in that direction--is part of the reason why the number on their current accountposition looks so astronomical. Although that might moderatesomewhat, it is likely to stay up in that range unless Japanexperiences a dramatic rebound, which no one at the moment isparticularly projecting.-17-12/21-22/81MS. TEETERS. Ted, has the British price situation improvedvery much?MR. TRUMAN. It has not improved, particularly over therecent period. The CPI in the second half of the year has beenrunning in the 11 to 12 percent range; it had come down to a plateauand backed up. It actually got down almost to 10 percent on a year-over-year basis and backed up a bit as the pound weakened in thesummer. So they are about back to where they started when Mrs.Thatcher came into power.MS. TEETERS. And they have had how many quarters of declinein real growth?MR. TRUMAN. Oh, I don't know. It is something astronomical,off my chart here. I think it has been occurring since the end of1979.MR. PARTEE. Yes, something like that.MR. SCHULTZ. Ted, why doesn't Japan stimulate [its economy]?They have their inflation rate down to around 4 percent, as I rememberthe figure, and the domestic economy is weak. The yen has been prettystrong. The current account surplus is just--. What is the reasonthey don't stimulate?MR. TRUMAN. I think there are two major reasons. One isthat they found themselves burned badly in the past by excessivestimulation, or they feel they have been burned badly. And they hadtwo rounds of rapid inflation--less the second time but it still wasworse than they expected--in the yen as you may recall in early 1980when it went to 260 yen per dollar, which was as ridiculous a level insome sense as the level of the mark in August. And that was partly aninflation phenomenon. The second reason is just that they have thismaybe well deserved fear of fiscal deficits, and the stimulus todomestic demand one might expect would come from the fiscal side.They have taken some cautious steps on the monetary side though interms of the mix of policy, everything else being equal, that tends tobe a little negative from external perspectives. But their fear is oftheir large budget deficit, which they see problems in financing; theycontinue to have troubles with banks in Japan in placing their longer-term debt. The banks have been gradually backing-off from this sortof short placement system that they have run for years and that hasled to caution in fiscal policy. Now they have a new budget in theprocess of being formulated; and from the indications I've seen, itmay be a little less contractionary than the rhetoric suggests. Theyare talking about expenditure increases in nominal terms on the orderof 6 to 6-1/2 percent, which does show some slight positive increasein real terms. But the rhetoric is going to be in the direction ofcontinued fiscal restraint.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And they are very worried about theirexchange rate. They figure they are in a "no-win" situation if theytake a stimulative action, particularly in monetary policy. Theirexchange rate will weaken and they already think it is too weak. Thatwould get them in more trouble on exports, and they are already in alot of trouble on exports. So how do they stimulate is the question,particularly when the budget deficit might--well, I don't know what it-18-12/21-22/81will do to the exchange rate. But they feel they can't do it on thebudgetary side and they can't do it on the monetary side because ofthe exchange rate.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That is why when they implementedthat 1 percent reduction of the discount rate last month they combinedit with heavy intervention.MR. ROOS. May I ask a question on the domestic end, ofeither Chuck or Jim Kichline? This next round of tax reductions, theones that take effect in 1982, are those to a great extent offset bypayroll tax increases?MR. PARTEE. There is hardly any increase, is there Jim?MR. KICHLINE. No, it is not very--MR. ROOS. Is that possible on these?MR. KICHLINE. No, it is very small. On January 1st of 1982the tax rate increase is only one-tenth of 1 percent compared with the1 percent that went into effect in January of 1981. And the wage basecontinues to rise; it goes up something like $3,000, I believe.MR. ROOS. So it is not a cut?MR. KICHLINE. No. In total the expected increase frompayroll taxes next year is something like $5-1/2 billion. The secondstage of the tax cut for individuals, when it goes into effect, is inthe range of $33 to $35 billion.MR. ROOS. Thank you.MR. BOEHNE. What does bracket creep do next year?MR. FORD. That eats up another part of the $33 billion youare talking about. You have $5 billion going for payroll taxes?MR. KICHLINE. Right.MR. FORD. The question is how much does bracket creep do?MR. KICHLINE. Well, I haven't thought about that question,so I don't have the answer. I think it is a factor but not--MR. SCHULTZ. I think Otto Eckstein is using a figure ofaround $15 billion or something like that.MR. FORD. $15 billion? So it uses up a little more thanhalf? In other words, is there a real reduction in the effective taxrates counting everything?MR. KICHLINE. The effect is reduced by bracket creep, butthere is a net stimulative effect, a substantial one. We also havelow income growth next year and that will hold down the effect ofbracket creep.12/21-22/81MR. GRAMLEY. The staff's full employment budget calculationsshow a switch of around $48 billion from the first half of '81 to thelast half of '82, with most of it coming in the latter half of '82.And that is something like 1-1/2 percent of GNP. That is a prettygood kick from the fiscal side. And I think Chuck was right that itis something we need to keep in mind as a source of stimulus as theyear goes on. I don't think we really are too far apart, Chuck; I dofeel that the recession is going to end and we are going to haverecovery.MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't think we are either. We had sucha series of extremely gloomy comments that I thought I ought to saysomething on the other side.MR. GRAMLEY. Your point is very well taken.MR. SCHULTZ. I think Mr. Boehne made the right comment. Weare at that stage of the cycle when one thinks it could just go"whoosh" down. It doesn't do that, but it always looks terrible.MR. BOEHNE. That is right. If you are at all pessimistic,this is the time when it comes out.MR. SCHULTZ. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have lots of uncertainties andconcerns in the business outlook. And, I must say the mood in Europeis extremely gloomy--more gloomy than the actual trends justify, itseems to me, at the moment. But their unemployment is very high andthey are very aware of that; it is phenomenally high given pastrecords during the postwar period.MR. TRUMAN. That is right. They have already exceeded the1974-75 peaks, partly with the help of the United Kingdom. But allthe countries have generally higher [unemployment now].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, in many countries it is comparable toours or even higher, which is very unusual just taking their rawfigures. On the other hand, I have a feeling that there is moremovement here on prices than there has been for years, literally, interms of a change in trend. And that among other things could havefavorable impacts on financial markets if anybody believed it. Idon't think the financial markets believe it yet. I am not sure Ibelieve it yet, but I must admit there is more gestation and moreferment and more talk about lower [wage] settlements than even thatreduction in 1976 or whenever it was indicates. [The staff has] somefairly optimistic price figures in its forecast. We will see, but Iam not sure they are out of sight. Let's go to your commentary, Mr.Axilrod.MR. AXILROD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me say I don't anticipate getting downto anything very [specific] in the way of numbers on this particularlonger-range exercise this afternoon or tomorrow. There may even beconceptual questions that people may want to raise about how topresent these, and I say that without having thought through anychange myself. So proceed, Mr. Axilrod.-20-12/21-22/81MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just make a couple of comments. Onthe technical side, the possibility exists of some redefinition of M2.What sounds logical is putting in retail RPs, which would raise M2some historically. If we take out institutional money market funds,it's practically a wash. That leaves us with some unknown amount ofinstitutional money market funds in money market funds that are notlabeled institutional and that we don't know how to break down. Whatto do with IRA/Keogh accounts, which might change appreciably nextyear, is a confused subject. I'll put it that way. It depends uponwhat one thinks M2 is measuring and what a transition of money intothose accounts may mean. It might have been worth distributing, but Iforgot about it, a little set of charts that Mr. Truman's peoplecirculated this morning [at the Board meeting]. The charts werenotable for showing that currently none of the main countries was nearits monetary targets this year and that enormous discrepancies--largerthan for the United States by a considerable margin--had developedbetween the different Ms. There were actual minus numbers for M1 insome cases with 12, 14, 15 percent increases in M2 or M3 as the casemay be. The only country that showed a nice orderly pattern was thecountry which doesn't have monetary targets. That was Japan. I don'tknow what the lesson is to that. But it was an extremely erraticpicture. It was poor--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But they don't have the innovationand the technology--MR. TRUMAN. They had gradually declining interest rates;that is the thing that has helped.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, you wouldn't think some of these othercountries did either. They have not had the swings in interest ratesand they haven't had the swings in the economy, which may saysomething too. These other countries have had some technologicalinnovation but the impression is that they haven't had as much asours. But the discrepancies in the numbers were even larger than wehad. It is a startling picture of the differences between the various[Ms] in those countries.MR. TRUMAN. We could have copies of those charts circulatedto the Committee tomorrow.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's have a little discussion inthe remaining time.MS. TEETERS. I have a question. Given the tentative targetsthat we established in July, are the various growth rates for the Msnow consistent?MR. AXILROD. Well, if our projections are right, we think M2and M3 growth just at, or a shade below, the upper end of the rangesis consistent with growth of M1 at the midpoint. That means themargin of error on the up side [for M2 and M3] is above their ranges.MS. TEETERS. Taking just the difference in the midpoints forthis year, a midpoint on M1 of, say, 4 percent, given a 2-1/2 to 5-1/2-21-12/21-22/81percent range, would imply 11 percent for M2 and 12-1/2 percent forM3?MR. AXILROD. Yes, but our projection is for somewhat slowergrowth in nominal GNP over the year, which tends to hold that down.MS. TEETERS. And then you have interest rates beginning torise again in the latter half of the year. Won't that mean the sameforces that were operating this year will tend to expand the rate ofgrowth in the broader aggregates?MR. AXILROD. Yes, to the degree that this year might havehad an unusual amount of shift into money market funds [from] marketinstruments or back into depository institutions that would nototherwise have been there, we would have less of that in store nextyear. In any event, maybe somewhat optimistically, we worked our waydown to a growth of just under 9 percent for M2 and M3, but it couldvery well be a little higher.MR. WALLICH. But why is that?MS. TEETERS. Essentially what you are saying is that we mayget a rerun of this year with M1 growth toward the bottom end and M2and M3 constantly on the--MR. AXILROD. Well, I don't have a strong feeling that way,Governor Teeters. It is not too bad to think of the change invelocity of M2 as normally about zero, or not much change. That wouldgive our present projection of M2 some credibility, and that is onaverage what happens. My instincts are not that we have severelyunderestimated it. But, obviously, there is not any room for error inthat, particularly.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Schultz.MR. SCHULTZ. Steve used the word credibility several times.I have been talking to market participants the last few weeks and thatterm keeps coming up in their discussions as well. In particular,just to give you three examples and names that might you remember: Intalking with Paul Boltz, who used to be with us and now is atContinental, and George Henry who is now up on Wall Street, and JohnPhalen from the NYSE, I asked the question about credibility. Theyall said that the credibility of the Federal Reserve is much higherthan it has ever been before. There is a cost to that, however. Thecost is [related to] the second question I asked them: What do youthink would happen to financial markets if we were to change courseperceptibly? And they said they thought it would have enormous impacton the financial markets. So, I think we have a situation in which wehave built up a lot of credibility, but the flip side of that is thatwe have painted ourselves into a corner in that if we don't staypretty well on the course that we have generally outlined, it is goingto have a rather substantial market impact.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. To pick up on what Fred said about credibilityand going back to Steve's comments on it, we recently had our fullacademic conference with about 35 professors from all around the West-22-12/21-22/81who specialize in money, banking, and monetary policy research, etc.While there are all different points of view and schools represented,from various degrees of monetarists to Keynesians to a few supplysiders, the one overwhelming conclusion that they arrived at when wesolicited their advice on appropriate ranges for money growth in 1982goes right to the credibility problem. It translated specificallyinto a recommendation from that group, for what it's worth, that itwould be a serious blow to our long-term credibility if we didn'tfollow through with something like the provisional ranges we announcedlast July--that is, at least a fractional reduction as a part of amulti-year program to get the rate of money growth down and, hence,the rate of inflation. So, that came across loud and clear.The other point I wanted to make, having supported Steve'sview on the vital nature of the credibility problem, with yourpermission Steve, is to take a contrary view with respect to the3-point range that we provisionally decided on for M1 in July forwhich you have again argued cogently here today. Looking back at theJuly minutes, just to refresh my own recollection, we considered threealternatives for M1. Two of them involved a 2-1/2-point spreadbetween the upper and lower [ends]; the third one, which we adopted,had a 3-point spread. And for reasons that were set forth by Steve,it has been the usual Fed policy to widen the range of long-termtargets when we perceive increased uncertainty in the economy. Now,that made sense as I thought about it under our former operatingprocedures, which had in effect tended to accommodate changes in moneydemand more or less automatically. In fact, I think the big problemin those days was that we accommodated too much, which is probably themain reason we changed the procedures. But with the new approach thathas been in effect since the fall of 1979, and particularly with ourrecord this year--and I might add that we got plaudits from thisacademic group for what we had done in 1981 [whereas] last year we hada lot of scar tissue as you might imagine and you have heard thatyourself--we are doing a better job of keeping within our targetranges and that has [helped] the credibility problem. We don'tautomatically accommodate changes in money demand. I suspect most ofus are uncertain about money demand in 1982. For example, our staffthinks, and I tend to share this view, that if anything there islikely to be a further downward shift in money demand in 1982. Butthat could be wrong. In the Bluebook Steve brought out thepossibility that it could go the other way. And to allow for thatpossibility, since we really don't know which way it is going to go, Iwould argue that, if anything, we ought to go back to the 2-1/2-pointspread for the following reasons: If money demand should shiftdownward, obviously the effective money supply is going to be greaterthan the actual observed money growth; on the other hand, even thoughI don't expect that this will happen, if the demand for money shouldshift upward, then the effective money demand of course will be lessthan observed money growth. Net, bottom line, if we are uncertain, asI am, about what might happen to money demand next year, I think weshould narrow the range of possible effective money by narrowing therange of observed money growth, which is the only thing that we cancontrol. So, at this moment, without hearing other views, I amleaning toward going back to that spread of 2-1/2 points that we hadbefore.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Where would you cut the half point,from the top or the bottom?-23-12/21-22/81MR. BALLES. Well, if I had to commit myself today, I'd gofor 3 to 5-1/2 percent instead of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, but that isjust provisional until we have had a lot more discussion.MS. TEETERS. 3 to 5-1/2 is only 2 percentage points.MR. PARTEE. No.MR. BALLES. 3 to 5-1/2 is 2-1/2 points.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With that I think we can agree. GovernorPartee.MR. PARTEE. One of my problems with talking about moneydemand is, as you say, that we don't know what it will be beforehand.I never know what it was afterwards! It seems to me that what we saywas a change of money demand is just the residual that one can'texplain. So I am a little reluctant to do a lot of changing on thebasis of that, although I suppose one could say that this year thereseems to have been a better economy until recently than one would haveexpected, given the very low money growth that we had in M1-B. Iassume you are talking about M1-B.MR. BALLES. Yes.MR. PARTEE. When you are talking about money demand, you arenot talking about the [broader measures]?MR. BALLES. No, all my remarks were on M1-B at this point.MR. PARTEE. On the technical side, I don't really understandM2 either, but one thing that has disturbed me about it is that itseems to me to be subject to the possibility of coming in higher as aresult of the structural changes. Steve mentioned it. We have IRAand Keogh accounts, and nobody really knows how they are going to goover the next year. They involve a very long-term commitment offunds, but there is a very desirable tax effect from [getting intothem]. I just don't know how it will go. In addition, we have thefact that people who are uncertain about the future at least now havethe option of going to money market funds from the market itself. Wehave seen continued rapid growth in recent months in the money marketfunds, partly because of the uncertainty, and that could continue inthe period ahead. But even more broadly, all of the efforts on thepart of the government and the administration to stimulate savingscould be successful. That is, we have IRA/Keoghs, the tax [cut], theall savers certificate, and the reduction in the maximum rate onearned income from 70 to 50 percent. And if [such saving] were tomaterialize, it seems to me it would tend to show up in the M2 number.Now, you have projected an increase in the personal saving rate fornext year. You mentioned the decline in the increase in nominal GNP--there is an increase of 1/2 percentage point, I think--but there isalso a 1/2 point increase in the saving rate projected from 1981 to1982. So I wonder whether, in fact, we don't need in that broaderaggregate to allow for the possibility at least that there is going tobe a larger gross flow that makes up the picture of the new economy.Now, I don't think what I say applies to M1-B. There may be somedownward drift in the demand function. But it is associated mainlywith transactions except for very, very temporary periods such as-24-12/21-22/81right now when maybe NOW accounts have some extra money in them as aparking place. I am not saying anything about numbers because I thinkit is too early to do that, but as we look ahead I think we shouldtake into account not only what Nancy said about a tendency to miss onthe M1 versus M2 and M3, but also what the effect of a changingstructure of the economy would be on the comparison between M1 and M2and M3.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I am concerned about theassumptions the staff is making with respect to the NOW accounts in1982 in that they assume that the adjustment is largely behind us.That goes against the experience of the NOW accounts in New England,where it took several years to make the adjustment fully. And itseems to me--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is an assumption the Committee maderather than the staff, if I may just put in a footnote.MR. MORRIS. Well, if the Committee made it, I also questionthat. I would call the Committee's attention to the recent rate ofgrowth in other checkable deposits. In November it was 46.2 percent.In the second week of December, when total M1-B was up $800 million,other checkable deposits were up $2.9 billion. To me, this does notlend a lot of credence to the idea that the adjustment is behind us.Apparently it still does to you, Steve?MR. AXILROD. Well, yes. I think that particular[development] has another explanation. We are adjusting essentiallyfor shifts out of existing demand deposits into NOW accounts becauseof the opening of NOW accounts. But the big increase in November andpresumably in early December was also associated with the fact thatsavings deposits, which had been dropping at a 20 percent or moreannual rate month-after-month, stopped dropping. And it is notimplausible that this is an aspect of the same phenomenon. That is,for precautionary reasons or what have you, people have increasedtheir saving rate as they did in the fourth quarter and some of thatmoney has spilled over into what they think of as the safest form onecan find that has a little interest paid on it. The turnaround insavings accounts and the increase in NOW accounts are--in my mind inany event--aspects of the same phenomenon. So I don't take that asevidence that the shift is not over. The only evidence we have thatthe shift is over, of course, is that the data we got on the number ofNOW accounts--my memory may be off in terms of the exact numbers--wasthat they increased at something like a 67 percent annual rate throughMay. And the data we now have for May through November at banks, andI think also at other depository institutions but I am not sure aboutthe latter, show an increase in the number of accounts at only about a12 percent annual rate. So, there has been a marked, clear, anddefinite [deceleration]. While the increase for the year is about aswe had projected in July, though much more than we projected inFebruary, the bulk of it came early in the year. And then there wasthis marked slowing in the increase in the accounts. We can never saythat some inflow isn't [going into] some account that it has taken aperson a year to learn about. But given the publicity this past yearand given these data, I feel that it is reasonable enough to say thatthe shift is over. The risk we are open to is the risk that interest-25-12/21-22/81rates may get a little lower than the staff is projecting and peoplemay say: "Well, I'll just put my money in the NOW account,particularly if that interest rate is permitted to rise some, ratherthan the money market fund. It is insured as a NOW account; it issafe; and what do I care about 2 percentage points?" Then we wouldget a sharp rise. But I don't think there will be a shift.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that happens, then what? I amgetting--MR. AXILROD. I don't think that is a structural shift inthe same sense that we were talking about this year. It's a shift,and you probably should accommodate it, but it is a different kind ofshift.MR. MORRIS. Well, there are two aspects that could get us introuble. One is that it is entirely possible that we could getcontinued shifts out of savings accounts into NOW accounts. Certainlyit would be at a slower rate, but it could be at a big enough rate tohave a substantial impact on the rate of growth of the new M1 andperhaps lead us to set too low a target for M1. That is what I amconcerned about for 1982.MR. AXILROD. I wouldn't say that is not [possible]; it is,certainly.MR. MORRIS(?). It is complicated also by people using theirNOW account as a savings vehicle--that is, by adding savings to theirtransactions balances. This would again lead us to way overshootingour M1 targets.MR. AXILROD. I think the latter, too, is also a real risk.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is right. There is a risk on thatside. But what do you do about the risk that Visa, Master Charge, anda bunch of other money market fund people will introduce sweeping ofdemand accounts and NOW accounts into money market funds next year?MS. TEETERS. That will only widen the spread between M1 andM2.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It will widen the spread between M1 andM2, but--MR. MORRIS. I think sooner or later we have to recognizethat we can't measure transactions accounts anymore. We ought tostart looking at other things. I think that is a clear message.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley, I don't want to go ontoo long on this scene here.MR. GRAMLEY. I just want to say a word about credibility andwhat it means in terms of selecting targets for next year. I thinkcredibility is terribly important. I do think we have improved ourcredibility enormously but we ought to understand why and what thathas to do with the selection of targets next year. We have gonethrough a two-year period in which the first year M1-B ran way overthe target and the second year it ran way under the target. M2 ran-26-12/21-22/81over in both years. The fluctuations in the money stock have beengreater since October of 1979 than they ever were before; so have thefluctuations in interest rates. And somehow we have come out ahead.I think the reason we have come out ahead is because in the pre-October 1979 period, whenever the System was faced with a choice oferring on the side of opting for a lower unemployment rate and moreinflation or the reverse, it opted for the former; and in the post-October 1979 period, we have said we are going to opt to hold the lineon prices and take a higher unemployment rate. That is basically whatthe markets are telling us. That is basically why we have had theimprovement in confidence. We have run a much, much tighter policy.So, what we ought to do is try to figure out what sorts oftargets we need for 1982 to run the kind of monetary policy we thinkis sensible and worry less about the announcement effects or thereactions of the financial markets or the public. On M1-B, althoughFrank has a point that we need to worry about the possibility thatdemand for M1-B will run over a 5-1/2 percent upper end, I think thebigger likelihood is that we will have trouble holding M1 growth up to2-1/2 percent because so many of these innovations, which have justgotten started, will continue. So, I would be prepared to live withthe 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range [adopted tentatively in July]. Andif it runs below, I don't think that is going to hurt our credibility.On M2, though, so many things are happening that to hold to a 6 to 9percent range runs the danger of having an M2 figure that is againway, way above the target. And I think we could raise that range to 7to 10 percent or 6 to 10 percent or something like that without doingour credibility any damage at all.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roos.MR. ROOS. I share to a great extent what Lyle has just said.It seems to me that we would sharpen this discussion if we were ableto agree upon and accept for ourselves certain basic targets relatedto those objectives that we really are charged with achieving. Thetwo principal objectives we should have are to achieve certain targetsof output growth as well as targets for the reduction of [inflation]and concurrently to consider what effect achieving those targets mighthave on the unemployment rate. Now, for what it is worth, [let metell you what] our people projected [would happen] if we were to comedown on a broad conceptual objective of maybe a 5 percent rate ofgrowth for M1-B in 1982 and 1983--assuming just theoretically thatthat was achievable by us and assuming a moderate slowing in thegrowth of federal spending and the tax policy as presently enacted.They projected that fourth quarter of 1981 to fourth quarter 1982nominal GNP would be something in the vicinity of 7-1/2 percent to 9percent; real GNP would be 1 to 2 percent; prices as measured by thedeflator would be 6-1/2 to 7 percent; and this would result in anunemployment rate of maybe 8-1/2 to 9 percent. And in 1983 if theseassumptions were held to, we again would see growth of nominal GNP of7-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, with a bit higher real GNP of 2 to 3 percent,price [increases of] 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent--that is, a reduction ofabout another point--and unemployment still 8-1/2 to 9 percent. Idon't know whether these objectives are what the Committee would optfor, but it seems to me that it is important, and should be importantwhen we discuss this tomorrow, for us to try to agree on what we thinkare the tolerable ranges of output growth, what price objectives wewould like to achieve, and what unemployment rate we would be willing-27-12/21-22/81to tolerate and then try to establish money growth rates that we thinkwould achieve those objectives.Probably some of you would part from the rationale that I amtrying to present by saying that money growth does not have a preciseeffect or even a meaningful effect on output or on prices. I thinkwhat seems to be happening on prices is more than a reflection of thewhims of the people who are negotiating wage settlements and that itreally is a reflection of the reduction in money growth that we haveachieved either purposely or otherwise. So, in thinking about thesethings, I believe we should try to define our objectives and thenregardless of how we come toward those--whether it is through moneygrowth control or interest rates--try to agree on what we think arethe decisions that would lead to the output growth and price targetsthat we agree on and the unemployment consequences.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have three more names on my list. Iwill not accept any more. And if any of the three on the list--Messrs. Wallich, Solomon, and Black--wish to wait until tomorrow, thatwould be acceptable. If you have an urge to say something, GovernorWallich is first.MR. WALLICH. I am perfectly willing to wait 'til tomorrow.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon, do you have an urge?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I just was going to ask you aquestion if you have the urge to answer. I can understand the casefor not including retail RPs and I can understand the case for notincluding IRA and Keogh accounts [in M2]. I don't understand what therationale would be, though, if I understood you right, for [notincluding] institutional money market funds.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Because they are more like [components of]M3 than M2.MR. AXILROD. The average size of those accounts is about$125,000. The average size of accounts of the others is between$12,000 and $16,000. So, there is a sharp distinction in the holderand it is our thought that the holders of the institutional fundswould otherwise be putting their money in CDs or market instrumentsand not otherwise be putting their money in M2-type instruments.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black, do you want to--MR. BLACK. No, I'll withdraw, Mr. Chairman, until tomorrow.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay, we will meet again tomorrow atwhatever time--MR. ALTMANN. 9:30 a.m. tomorrow morning.MR. PARTEE. Weather permitting.[Meeting recessed]-28-12/21-22/81December 22, 1981--Morning SessionCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think we can proceed with thediscussion of the longer-term ranges in a very tentative way.Governor Wallich, you were cut off before.MR. WALLICH. Yes, I was. All I can think about as I look atwhat we are proposing to do [is whether we are] setting very tighttargets. We are proposing to finance a 7 percent growth in nominalGNP, which is all inflation and has a little minus in real growth,with a 4 percent rise in M1-B, [using] the midpoint of the target. Inother words, we are relying on a shift in the demand function forM1-B. We are also accepting some base drift that we are carrying overfrom 1981, which adds to the tightness. But the fact is that we havehad base drift from time to time and sometimes in very durable form.And the reason that our policy in the mid-1970s, for instance, nowlooks so poor is not that the targets were not very tight; they lookedextremely tight. But we got an amount of shift in the demand functionthat made them very loose. The growth of effective money was muchhigher than we realized. It was again much higher than we realized in1981. We got a very large shift in the demand function, on the orderof 6 percent, which meant that the very modest nominal GNP growth thatwe got was financeable.So I would say that our main risk is really on the side ofgetting new additional shifts in the demand function. We haveanalyzed these and how they work. We have a theory that they comeafter peaks in interest rates. We can now foresee theminstitutionally, with the sweeps out of demand and NOW accounts intomoney market mutual funds. All that suggests that we are going tosee, if anything, greater economies in M1 than we have seen in thepast and that, therefore, the seemingly very tight targets ex postwill not look nearly so tight. One can see the same thing if onelooks simply at what is in M1. It does not contain that part of moneymarket mutual funds that clearly serves as transactions balancestoday, which I think must be quite considerable. And it doesn't takeaccount fully either of the liquidity enhancing effect of theexistence of money market mutual funds that people can write one checka month on; that saves them half their normal bank balance in thatthey can replenish their bank balance in the middle of the month outof their money market mutual fund. So, again, I think one can seethat in practice that makes the tight M1 target of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2percent much less tight than it seems.Now, I think the wide range that we are proposing is allright because there is so much uncertainty here that one cannotoperate with a very tight target. We do have to realize that thesetight targets probably condemn us to quick, short swings in business.If we follow a tight money supply track and stay on it, interest rateswill move up and down sharply. We have not accepted the full declinein interest rates that would have come had we stayed exactly on M1-B,and we didn't because we knew that in 1980 when we came close to doingthat we got a very sharp drop but then a very quick snapback. Itdidn't do us any good against inflation this time by not allowingquite [as] extreme a [shortfall from our] money supply target.Hopefully we will get a more lasting effect. We do need a period ofslack in the economy if we want to wind out the inflation. Ourproblem is whether we are going to bounce back and forth going up and-29-12/21-22/81down to the very top peak of the ceiling and then to the floor as aresult of these techniques; to the extent that we can avoid that, weclearly should.Now, just a word about M2. M2 [growth] has usually been inline very roughly with [that of] nominal GNP. So I would view withalarm any increase in [the] M2 [range]. It is true that there aresome practices [in train] that may make M2 rise abnormally, forinstance the IRA and Keogh expansion that may be ahead. But broadlyspeaking, M2 tends to expand faster in contractions and expands moreslowly than nominal GNP in expansions because of the way the fixedrate deposit interest rates compete with market instruments. So, weare going to go through eventually a period of expansion. I wouldthink that would hold M2 down, and I don't see much harm in arelatively tight M2 ceiling. I think the removal of institutionalmoney market mutual funds and addition of retail RPs would be areasonable adjustment. We shouldn't be in the posture of nevermending the structure of our aggregates. Thank you.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Well, I think the recession that we are in mightwell be more severe than a number of other people seem to believe.Nevertheless, there is a real limit as to what we can do in monetarypolicy to cushion the decline. We have tried a lot of times in thepast to do this and we have gotten ourselves into a progressively morevexing web of problems in the process. Really, the difficulties thatwe will have for the next few months are foreordained, so to speak,and inflation is still the underlying problem that we have to dealwith. So it seems to me that if we make any significant moves towardtrying to accelerate the aggregates, we run a very high risk ofreintensification of inflationary pressures and another debacle in thelong-term bond markets. That would be very, very bad for somecompanies that need to tap that market fairly soon and [would lead], Ibelieve, eventually to a deeper recession and more unemployment downthe road than we otherwise would have.But there are two issues that I do think deserve some specialpriorities that haven't been [addressed] in exactly this way byanyone. One is the issue of multiple targets; [the other is] thewidth of the target ranges. My feeling is that the combination ofthese multiple targets and wide target ranges quite legitimatelyraises doubts in the minds of quite a few of our critics about theseriousness of our efforts to control the rate of growth in the moneysupply. I continue to believe that M1 is the best of the aggregatesto target on and I really would prefer to target on that one alone,although I realize I won't get you all to agree with that. Further, Iwould favor setting a relatively narrow range for M1 and then if weshould find that there is a significant change in the demand for moneyand we can agree that that has in fact taken place--although I shareChuck's apprehensions about that--I think the best way to handle thatis with an overt and publicly announced change in our targets. Now, Irecognize that there are some technical problems in moving from anadjusted M1 range to an unadjusted range. It seems to me that thistarget problem is reasonably manageable. Actually M1-B looks as if itwill grow about 4.7 percent from the fourth quarter of 1980 to thefourth quarter of 1981, and it seems to me that that should be aboutthe upper limit for 1982. So, I am thinking in terms of something-30-12/21-22/81like 3 to 5 percent. But I would want to aim at the midpoint of thatand make a determined effort to hit it. That midpoint, incidentally,is the same as the midpoint of the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range thatwe tentatively adopted in July.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Rice.MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I hope I'm in better voice thismorning than I was yesterday. I would like to say a few words aboutcredibility. I agree with most of the varying earlier comments on theimportance of credibility. However, it seems to me that credibilityhas several dimensions--certainly more than one. Many people I havetalked to feel that it was the high interest rate policy of theFederal Reserve that caused the current recession and they wonder whatkind of institution this is that really wants to cause a recession.On unemployment there are some credibilities involved, too, exceptthat it is negative credibility. In the long run, not necessarily inthe short run, we have to take account of this negative credibility.I agree with a good part of Governor Gramley's observation that somepart of the current credibility that we seem to be enjoying,especially from the investor community, is based on the perceptionthat we are willing to accept very high rates of unemployment as ameans of fighting inflation. However, over time we ought not leavethe impression with the public that we are indifferent to high ratesof unemployment. It seems to me possible over time to accommodateboth the need to fight inflation, which is the primary objective, andto consider as well the effects of our policy on the economy.As to the target ranges for the aggregates for 1982, BobBlack said much of what I wanted to say about that. In the periodimmediately ahead, i.e. 1982, we should in the process of maintainingour credibility try to ensure that we do not starve the economy formoney and that there will be enough money around to provide for arecovery, which we need. Therefore, I would favor narrowing thetarget range for M1 somewhat. I would favor raising the lower limitof the range from 2-1/2 to 3 percent and keeping the upper limit at 5-1/2 percent. I think that was the proposal made by John Balles. Thatwould tend to keep our performance closer to the target and reduce thepossibility that there will be a repeat of this year's performance,where growth of M1 fell very, very short of the target range. If weset the lower limit higher, it would be more likely that the shortfallin money growth would not be substantial. So, I would propose a rangeof 3 to 5-1/2 percent; and 5-1/2 percent for the upper limit, ofcourse, demonstrates that we are sticking with our policy of graduallyreducing the rate of money growth. But increasing the lower band alsowill reduce the likelihood that we would starve the economy for moneyduring the period immediately ahead. I would also say that we don'twant to be too much influenced, in my judgment, by notions of growthin effective money. Particularly we should not be in a position oftrying to place too much confidence in our ability to predict shiftsin money demand. I think we should concentrate on the money growththat we can measure. With regard to M2, I would stick with the rangeof 6 to 9 percent that we had set earlier and hope that that rangewill turn out to be more consistent with the target we set for M1.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.-31-12/21-22/81MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think it is ironic thatthe Federal Reserve has switched to monetarism at the very time whenour ability to measure the money supply has eroded dramatically andour ability to differentiate money from liquid assets is rapidlydisappearing. And, therefore, the relationship between what we callmoney and nominal GNP, which is really what we are after, is becomingincreasingly unstable. I think we've lucked out [this past] year. Wehave one target below [our objective] and a couple above and bankcredit barely within. I hope we luck out this year, but I wouldn'tknow what set of numbers--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. By this year do you mean 1982?MR. MORRIS. Yes, in 1982. I wouldn't know what set ofnumbers presented to the Committee would assure us that we will luckout in 1982. We are seeing very strange phenomena in both the numbersthat we call money. We had something happen in November that I thinkhas never happened before in a recession. We got a sharp decelerationin the economy accompanied by a sharp acceleration in our moneymeasures. That has never happened before, at least to my knowledge.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me linger on that point for a second.[Let me ask] our staff experts: Has it ever happened before? Thesame question has occurred to me. We only have a month and a half ofexperience--MR. AXILROD. I have not made a thorough research of the pastrecords. I would have to do that.MR. MORRIS. Take all months where industrial productiondropped by more than 2 percent.MR. ROOS. I don't think any monetarist ever maintained thata 1- or 2-month trend, upward or downward, will have an effect on GNP.MR. MORRIS. It is more than that, Larry. If you look atM1-B last year, its relationship to nominal GNP is not what one wouldhave forecast at the beginning of the year by any model that I knowof. And it seems to me that the situation is going to get moredifficult in the future as banks begin sweeping consumer deposits intomoney market funds. So, it seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that the timeis ripe to appoint a new committee on the directive. That committeeshould be charged with finding some target for monetary policy whichis more stably related to GNP than the targets we are currentlystruggling with.MR. GRAMLEY. And if they can't?MR. MORRIS(?). Well, I don't think we ought to conclude atthe outset that they can't.MR. PARTEE. Maybe it's currency.MR. MORRIS. It seems to me it could be currency or what isleft of it.MR. FORD. That is half of it.-32-12/21-22/81MR. MORRIS. Currency has become very unstable.MR. RICE. Do you think we have given monetarism a fair test?MR. MORRIS. Well, I think we could have given it a muchbetter test 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, than we can now.Monetarism does require that we are able to measure accurately themoney supply. That is absolutely essential to the monetaristapproach. And once you take the position that you can no longerdifferentiate money from liquid assets, you are in real trouble tryingto pursue a monetarist course. Now, if we don't find an alternative,then we are suddenly going to shift back to targeting on interestrates. Looking at the short-term options the Committee has beenpresented with, I suspect very strongly that such a trend is alreadyunder way because of the fact that we had a shortfall in M1 in 1981,which we prized because it offset the overruns in the otheraggregates. We have an extremely weak economy and for Decemberthrough March we are presented in alternative B with a target of 2percent for M1 and in alternative C with a target of zero. Now, itdoesn't seem to me that either of those suggests any greatdetermination to give a lot of priority to controlling M1. But thereis something in the description of alternative B that makes sense tome. We used to call it around this table "maintaining prevailingmoney market conditions." It seems to me that it says the case for a2 percent growth rate as in alternative B is that it would beassociated with maintaining roughly the present level of interestrates for another month. Maybe I am reading more between the linesthan Steve meant to write in there, but that--MR. PARTEE. Well, he certainly wrote an analysis I am sure.MR. MORRIS. But the less confidence we have in thesenumbers, the more we are going to drift back to controlling interestrates. And I would prefer that we find some other option.MR. ROOS. May I ask Frank a question very quickly, Mr.Chairman? If we had a shortfall in M1-B this year and we have a weakeconomy, how does that add up to the conclusion that there is littlerelationship between the growth of M1-B and output? I think thatstrengthens the case for the fact that M1-B is a predictor of economicactivity.MR. MORRIS. Well, I would like to see the model that a yearago would have forecast the kind of nominal GNP growth we had in 1981as being associated with the kind of M1-B growth we had.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Which M1-B?MR. ROOS. You are invited to St. Louis, my good friend!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, given all that has been saidhere about the problems with M1-B, I would point out a littlearithmetic exercise we did. I had my people go all the way back toOctober of 1979 and construct from the fourth quarter of 1979 thelevel of M1-B that we should have in the fourth quarter of this year-33-12/21-22/81assuming that we had achieved the midpoints of all the targets thatthe Committee has had for that whole period of almost 2-1/2 years.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you are talking about the short-runtargets or the long-run targets?MR. CORRIGAN. No, the long-run targets.MR. PARTEE. From the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourthquarter of 1981?MR. CORRIGAN. Right.MR. PARTEE. Two years?MR. CORRIGAN. Right.MR. GRAMLEY. Shift-adjusted?MR. CORRIGAN. Yes. Now, doing these numbers gets a littletricky, but let me just point out for the record that the target levelof M1-B that comes out of that exercise is $429.2 billion. The actuallevel, leaving aside the last two weeks in December, is $428.6billion, a whopping difference of $600 million. Perhaps things aren'tquite as bad as we make them out to be.MR. MORRIS. But do you believe in compensating errors as abasic--MR. CORRIGAN. My own view, Frank, would be that the errorsover the period haven't been all that big. There has been some luckand there have been some ups and downs, but when you look at theperformance of policy over the whole period, I don't think it is allthat bad. It could be better, but certainly it isn't something thatone has to be ashamed of by any stretch of the imagination. That iswhere I start from. I am under no illusions, of course, that we canmeasure M1-B right now. I don't think we can. And I think thesediscussions about what model would say what really miss the pointbecause in order to have a model you still have to plug in the moneysupply number to get the GNP out the other end. And quite apart fromone's views about monetarism, models, or anything else, there is alegitimate question as to what to put in on the money assumptions.My instinct, however, in thinking about the 1982 targets, isto leave them where they are. In the case of M1, I think thelikelihood is great that we will continue to see strong forces workingin the direction of a continuation of the so-called downward shift inthe demand for M1-B. I don't see those forces lessening; as a matterof fact, if anything, I think they will remain as strong or maybestrengthen further. But even if that is the case, I still have someconcern that later in the year the targets that we have for M1-B, evenallowing for some further shift adjustment, could prove very difficultto hit if the economy were to pick up the way the staff is projecting,recognizing that there are an awful lot of private forecasts aroundthat would place the economy stronger in the second half of the yearthan the staff has. So, my point here is that even under the best ofcircumstances those targets for narrow money, particularly as we getout in the year, will prove to be ambitious. And in fact it may be-34-12/21-22/81that the only way they will prove workable in that timeframe is inassociation with a price performance that is a little better perhapsthan is currently being forecast. Incidentally, Jim, what was the CPIthis morning?MR. KICHLINE. It is up 0.5 [for November] compared to the0.4 in October. Food prices rose 0.2, the same as in October. Andhousing performed very well; it was only up 0.4, and that reflects thesizable increase in the mortgage rate and a 3/4 percent decline inhome prices. On average, it is a good report.MR. CORRIGAN. Anyway, as I said, unless we get a littleluckier on prices, I think those targets could be ambitious evenallowing for demand shifts. On M2 I find myself attracted to GovernorPartee's comments yesterday. I think there is a possibility that wecould see some rebound in savings in the fundamental underlying sensenext year. At least as far out as one can reasonably see, cash-typeinvestments are probably going to continue to look pretty good. AndI, at least, am inclined to the view that the IRA account could be abigger factor than most of the discussion around the table hassuggested so far. It is very attractive to begin with, but the factthat so many companies are going ahead with payroll deduction planswill make it such a simple thing and so attractive from an ease oftransactions point of view that that could really generate somemomentum in these accounts as the year unfolds. I must say I amperplexed as to what that means. I might even be prepared to make anargument that IRA accounts don't belong in M2 because they are a muchmore permanent type of savings than are the other [components of] M2.I get that feeling a little more so when I recognize that it is onlythe pure coincidence of who is managing an IRA account that is goingto determine whether it ends up in the banking system or someplaceelse. The distinction is pretty arbitrary as to whether a particularIRA ends up as a component of M2 or in a money market instrument ofsome kind or another. And I would at least raise the question ofwhether they belong in M2 at all. But if we have them in M2, theyalone could create some real problems in terms of the upper limit ofthe target for M2. That would lead me a bit in the direction thatGovernor Gramley suggested yesterday even though I am hesitant, to putit mildly, to change any of these targets, although they were onlytentatively agreed upon by the Committee in July. That is it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.MR. KEEHN. With regard to M1-B, based on the results forthis year as a whole and the expectations for next year, I fail to seeany compelling reason to expand the width of the target range. Andlacking any compelling reason to do it, in my view we would make amistake to do that. Therefore, I would be in favor of keeping thespread at 2-1/2 percentage points as it is currently. Lendingcredence to the credibility theme that any change might be regarded astinkering at this point, I would keep the spread at the samemagnitude. But I would continue the program of restraint, which Ithink has been effectively established and, therefore, I would be infavor of moving the range down to, say, 3 to 5-1/2 percent.With regard to M2, again given the results of this year--withgrowth running at or near the top of the range all year long--it seemsto me that the relationship between M1-B and M2 this year has [not]12/21-22/81been terribly tight. And because of the questions about what islikely to occur next year in the components of M2, which we havetalked about a good deal, and the fact that we have established enoughpress regarding the "noise," if you will, in M2, I think this would bean appropriate time to make a change. Therefore, I would be in favorof maintaining the 3-point spread but moving the range up a bit to,say, 7 to 10 percent as a way of trying to get it back to a morecomfortable level for an uncertain year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We have heard good reasons why awider range in M1-B makes sense. There is uncertainty due to theinnovation in technology impact, which is likely to continue. Onbalance, weighing the pros and cons, I would leave M1-B where it is.And I would leave M2 where it is rather than raise it if the Committeewere to agree that we have to show a greater willingness to make amidyear adjustment if innovation in technology continues to bringabout these shifts. It seems to me that there might be some advantagein terms of this famous or infamous credibility problem, inforeshadowing that adjustment in the policy record of this meeting ora subsequent meeting as well as in the Chairman's presentation inFebruary. We can put everybody on notice and give it someconcreteness and say it is not just a cop-out. We can point to thedivergence between M1-B and M2 and say that if this divergence widenedbecause of innovation in technology, then we would be prepared to makean adjustment in the targets at midyear. I think it would be amistake for us to shrink from that. If I thought we were going toshrink from that, then I'd say we really should go with Lyle Gramley'ssuggestion and raise the M2 target. I should add, since I didn't makemyself 100 percent clear yesterday, that I strongly support taking IRAand Keogh accounts out of M2. I guess they would go into M3; I am notquite sure whether they would go into M3 or into something else, maybeL.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They may even vary L.MR. CORRIGAN. That is right.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I still have some difficulty inunderstanding the rationale for excluding institutionally held,corporation held, money market balances in money market funds. Thefact that they average $125,000 whereas the average household balanceaverages $12,000 is logical; one is a business and the other is ahousehold. The motivation or the potential use of it as money--it isliquidity--is still the same. So I am not quite sure I understandfully why one can make that distinction or what the rationale is.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you are treading on delicatequestions of what M2 and M3 mean anyway. But I think [unintelligible]the rationale [is that] M2 is more a household kind of liquid asset.And there is no difference between any institutional money market fundand [an institutional] CD, let's say, which is in M3 and not in M2.You'd certainly put it in M3.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But an institutional CD, even ifnegotiable, does have a fixed maturity. It's locked in for a periodof time.12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Three months, four--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Whereas this money in the moneymarket fund can move in 24 hours.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But where does it move to? It moves to aCD or 20-day commercial paper.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Or it moves to a checking account tofinance transactions.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Conceivably, yes. Mr. Ford.MR. FORD. Before I make my comments, I'd say on that lastpoint that I have heard, but I haven't seen evidence, that a lot ofsmaller businesses tend to use these money market funds as a demandaccount. That reinforces Tony's point, I would think. I don't knowhow prevalent that is but certainly in the partnership areas a numberof professionals tell me that they just use their Merrill Lynchaccount for all the bills of over $500 that they have to pay.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Nobody knows. There is some of that, butI don't think they would tend to be the ones that label themselvesinstitutional funds. These are the Merrill Lynch accounts or Fidelityaccounts or whatever.MR. FORD. Yes, maybe they are putting in the--MS. TEETERS. We are going to undertake a special survey ofthe money market mutual funds at the beginning of next year, isn'tthat the timing, Steve?MR. AXILROD. It might be a little later than that, but itwill be early next year.MS. TEETERS. And we'll try to find out what the transactionuse is and what the turnover is on them.MR. BALLES. Oh, good.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are not going to find out. We can try.MS. TEETERS. We can try.MR. FORD. Well, that then leads into another suggestion Ihave but first, with regard to M1-B, we feel we can be comfortablewith the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent tentative target we announced or with2-1/2 to 5 percent, either one. I don't think the 1/2 point makes abig difference. I have some sympathy with what Si said, certainly, ofnot making the range too much wider. Dropping the NOW accountadjustment seems to make lots of sense. So, we would say: Let's gofrom the end of year [and use] the last quarterly average as the base,as we normally do and as I think is recommended in the Bluebook, andgo with perhaps the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range. But we are veryconcerned about the nature of the innovations that will be comingalong, some of which we hope will be at least partly visible by thetime of the next meeting. Nancy just mentioned that she thought weought to do some more research on some of these things such as the-37-12/21-22/81MMFs. I would suggest that we gear up either at the Washington leveland/or at some of the Reserve Banks to get on top of the IRAdevelopments, because the potential there is tremendous. If you takethe number of American households and even if you assume that only 10percent of them go into a $2,000 IRA, it comes to something on theorder of just under $15 billion that could be moved around. And ifyou assume it is 20 percent or--MR. PARTEE. I just figured 10 million accounts at $2,000 is$20 billion.MR. FORD. Yes. Okay, there you go.MR. AXILROD. For sure, President Ford, we are going to bedeveloping and suggesting a data system to capture the flows as muchas possible.MR. FORD. Right, [that needs to be done] early on. I wouldsay even before that if there is any way to find out intentions--thatmight be too romantic for research--it would be interesting to findout not just how many households but obviously the source [of thefunds]. If people shift out of NOWs, obviously that is one thing; ifthey shift among M-2 type assets, then it is less scary. I'd becurious to know whether people are just going to take a largepercentage of the funds out of their NOW accounts or whether they willshift out of other M2 assets or whether the funds will come fromthings outside of M2, all of which have very different implications.I'd just encourage everybody, especially our Washington leadership, tolook at the early returns on IRAs.MR. PARTEE. Or [it could] raise the saving rate.MR. CORRIGAN. That is right.MR. PARTEE. It could.MR. CORRIGAN. That is what the payroll deduction could do.MR. FORD. While we are at it, if we could find out anythingabout these sweep accounts, they, too, as a financial innovation havetremendous potential for bombing us on M1-B. So we should take a lookat whether among some of the major institutions there really will bean outbreak of virulent competition in that area, which could furtherput us in the box of having undershoots on the M1-B target andpossibly overshoots on M2. What concerns me most is the fact that allyear long--while Jerry's calculation was a very elegant one and speakswell for how we actually came out on M1-B--I've had the feeling thatwe were undershooting one target and overshooting the other. And forthe next year we ought to try to figure out a way, if we can, to getout of that box so that we are not always damned on the one side forbeing too tight and damned on the other side for being too loose.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How do you suggest we do that?MR. FORD. Well, if the research supports it and if the earlyreturns on IRAs give any evidence that we should expect M2 to getlooser and wider, I'm leaning to the view that we ought to considerjust biting the bullet and raising the upper end of that target while-38-12/21-22/81doing other things to indicate that it is consistent with a lower ortighter target on M1-B. For example, we might choose a base thatinvolves a little less drift--take the year-end M1-B figure if ithappens to be lower than the quarterly average. Or if there is someother way we could start from a lower point, keep it down at 5-1/2percent and do something which in combination says we are anticipatingthat M1-B already is going to be overshooting, so we are tightening upin that area and we think financial innovations really are going tomake M2 behave in a way that suggests we can anticipate a higher upperend if the research supports it. That is why I hope we [won't] waituntil--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I interjected my question because Iam not sure the research supports anything. And I am not sure we willhave the research that is going to support anything. The nature ofthe problem is that we don't know.MR. FORD. We can't know, but don't you think we can learn alittle about IRAs because by the middle of February we will--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can learn a little something, [but]experience not only here but internationally suggests that we are notvery good at predicting this [kind of development].MR. FORD. Then maybe we have to go to Mr. Morris' idea thatwe look at some other things, although my thrust in the research wouldprobably be different than his. I'd say, if we are going to reexaminewhat we shoot for, that we ought to pull out the monetary base andtotal reserves as possibilities, along with whatever [measures] he hasin mind, although those two present difficulties that everybody herehas commented on at one time or another. Where we are presentlystructured, as I see it, is that we are making ourselves subject tothe same problems we had this year. And I would be inclined not togive up so easily, Paul, on being able to find out something about thetrend in financial innovation. You may well end up being right, but Iwould want to come down on the research to see if we can find outsomething about IRAs and sweep accounts at least.MR. SCHULTZ. Some information on the payroll plans probablywould be the best indicator that we could get, if there is a way tofind that out relatively soon. I think that would give us some realindication.MR. FORD. I don't know about the public sector, but our ownbenefits people are putting it into our plan to make it easy, in linewith the comment that Jerry made.SPEAKER(?). Yes, we are proposing to do that.MR. FORD. It may be that if all other government agenciesare going to do that, we might have a big chunk [of employers doingthat]. I don't know.MR. PARTEE. I don't think so.MR. FORD. Maybe we ought to do a little survey of majoremployers or something like that.-39-12/21-22/81MR. RICE. But we don't know what the [employee] receptionwould be.MR. BLACK. We don't know when it would [go into effect]either, do we?MR. RICE. Yes and no.MR. BLACK. It won't be until April or May sometime.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We won't know where the money comes from.MR. CORRIGAN. This really gets murky because people can[wait to put in the] money all the way out until April of 1983.MR. BLACK. That's right.MR. FORD. Yes.MR. CORRIGAN. They can put it in [then] and get the taxdeduction for 1982.MR. BLACK. I bet a lot of people will borrow money in Aprilof 1983.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think it is useful tospeculate on this at great length at this point. Are you finished,Mr. Ford?MR. FORD. Yes, I'm sorry. I just hope you are not rightabout it, Paul; you might well be right. But I would hate to give upso easily on saying we can't foresee innovation in the financialmarkets.MR. RICE. I don't think we ought to give up on the principleof how to treat these various [monetary measures]. We ought to decidewhere they ought to be.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I agree with that and I agree we ought todo all we can to understand what is going on. Mrs. Teeters.MR. PARTEE. I wonder where the thrift plan is in these Ms?MR. RICE. It is harder to understand what is going on.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Teeters.MS. TEETERS. I simply want to support maintaining the M1-Btarget. I have a lot of sympathy with what Frank has said. I thinkwe do need to see whether we can find something else. It may be inbetween the two ways that we operate but I am not satisfied with whatwe have. I am really very concerned about the M2 target because wehad a 7 percentage point gap between the growth of M1-B shift-adjustedand M2. We got ourselves into this situation where we are below one[target] and at or above the other. I would guess that the midpointof M2 that is consistent with the midpoint of M1-B at 4 percent is 9percent so that we are going to find that we will do again what we didlast year. If we hit the 4 percent midpoint of the M1-B target, we-40-12/21-22/81will hit M2 at 9 percent or above. So it seems to me this is aperfect time to adjust it. We have a history of a 7-point gap. If weaim for a midpoint of 9 percent or thereabouts for M2, that is only a5-point differential instead of 7, so we are not repeating completelywhat we did last year. And we'd have a better chance, I think, ofstaying within the targets and not agonizing all year long about whichone is the most important and which one is going over. So, I wouldassociate myself with those who would accept the existing M1-B target,increase the M2 target, and remove the IRAs and Keoghs [from M2]. Wedon't have a record of changing in midstream, Tony. We have neverchanged a target.MR. PARTEE. Never?MS. TEETERS. We never have, from the time we [establishedthe tentative ranges] on down.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's because we are always afraidour credibility will be injured if we change. But if we foreshadowit--put people on notice that we have a very clear, honest case oninnovation in technology--and everybody is aware of it, we can beginto educate people more and make it easier for us.MS. TEETERS. Yes, but then when we get down to doing it, wealways say we won't do it.MR. WALLICH. Or we make another shift adjustment.MS. TEETERS. We'd rather overshoot than change the target.That is why establishing them in July a year ahead of time is such amistake. We have no idea what the next year is going to be like. Andthis is not a very good forecast. As of the fourth quarter of thisyear, we will be exactly where we were in the fourth quarter of 1979.And if the forecast is accurate for next year, in the fourth quarterof 1982 we will be exactly where we were in the first quarter of 1981.That is really a galloping economy over two years!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Winn.MR. WINN. I would like to join the chorus of those who arecalling for a re-examination of these measurements because I think weare just playing mumbo-jumbo with the numbers game now. I think wecan do a better job of providing measurements of what money is allabout. And until we do that, Fed targets don't make much sense to mebecause we just explain them away by all these deviations. InColumbus, for example, our money market fund clearings have gone from25,000 a day to 115,000; that gives you some idea of the kind ofactivity that is going on in that area. This is the Merrill Lynchclearing setup. And here is a backward way of getting into thatmeasurement.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is the number of checks or--?MR. WINN. On the money market funds.MR. PARTEE. It certainly is the most active.12/21-22/81MR. WINN. I think we have to get on with the measurements.[As for] Frank's point on seeking other measurements, unless we havesome measure of the reserve base or something else, we don't reallyhave reserveable assets involved in the money concept. I just thinkwe must get on with an attempt to remeasure some of these magnitudes.They may not be very accurate, but they are a lot better than reachingin the dark for some numbers that really don't mean anything. Andthen if we don't hit them, we explain it away because of all thesedeviations. In view of that uncertainty, I would prefer to stay rightwhere we are with these targets but to get on with the recalculationof some of these numbers. Unless we do that, we won't have any way ofestablishing a reserve basis for these items. We are playing more andmore an inequitable game in terms of those who participate in theconventional forms. It just behooves us to get on with the problem ofmeasurements. I don't think we have any real basis for our shiftadjustment; it [involves] numbers that we had some time ago but Idon't think those are accurate. I urge that we get on with theproblem of a re-examination of these targets.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, instead of urging, I would suggestthat if you have some practical way of going about this, reduce thatto a piece of paper and tell us.MR. WINN. Yes, I will make an effort.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.MR. BOYKIN. Back to the credibility problem: In terms ofthe long-term ranges, it seems to me that the tentative ranges that wehave published and that have been discussed and seem to be understoodon the outside probably should not be changed at this point simplybecause I don't think we know enough to improve that in any way. I amnot saying they are the best; I doubt that we know what is the bestright now. But M1-B and M2 at least as of midyear seemed to be givingmore consistency in terms of a relationship. Whether that will holdup remains to be seen. I think we should hold to [seeking] a gradualreduction [of these ranges] over time; it's a perception that I stillthink is very important, particularly to those who are lesssophisticated, and we should hold to that. What is actually going tohappen with regard to the innovation that is coming is merespeculation on our part, as we can tell from going around the tablehere. And I agree very much with Tony Solomon that the time to makean adjustment is when we have some pretty firm facts or a basis fordoing it and doing it in a supportable way rather than by conjecture.The idea of giving the first signal that this will be rethought has alot of appeal to me. I don't think the fact that we have never made amidyear shift should [mean] that we never would, if the facts arethere and a change is supportable. So, I would be inclined to staywhere we said tentatively we were going to be and let events unfold;and I'd be ready to make adjustments or changes in definitions, orwhatever will be necessary, but based on more knowledge than we havenow.MS. TEETERS. It is not just a midyear shift; it is a mid-18month shift or any shift in announced ranges. We just don't do it.MR. BOYKIN. Well, whether we do it at midyear or do itbefore then or after, it seems to me that it would be incumbent upon-42-12/21-22/81the Committee to reach a judgment and make a determination when thefacts support it, whatever point in time that is.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. I have just a couple of comments, Paul. I shareFrank's frustration on knowing what money is these days. He proposeda new Committee on the directive. A couple of months ago I think Ispoiled Steve's whole day by suggesting that maybe first and foremostwe needed a major restudy of the monetary aggregates. And that is whyI was so glad to hear Governor Teeters say that we are going to dosomething about money market funds early in the year. Could I ask alittle more about that? For example, Steve, we know that some of theinvestment houses are arbitrarily adding to observed M1-B either 10percent or 20 percent of money market funds on the assumption thatsome of these must be transactions balances. I would like to ask thequestion whether our look-see is really going to zero in on whatpercentage of these [funds] are turning over at the rate of normaltransactions balances. I think we really need that kind of studybefore we need a Committee on the directive, Frank.MR. AXILROD. That is our hope. In response to a Boarddiscussion, we are in the initial stages of outlining a one-timesurvey; whether it will be a sample or complete [coverage] we are notcertain yet. For the money market funds, we have attempted todetermine in more detail than we now have the various characteristicsof the account: the ownership, size, turnover, and other[characteristics] we may think of. We would expect to have a draft ofthe survey in a few weeks to bring before the Board. That is thestage where we are now and we hope to have it in the field relativelypromptly. Whether it could be done and accomplished before theFebruary meeting, I don't know; that seems like a very tight schedule,but we are trying to [meet it].MS. TEETERS. Steve, I am fascinated by Willis' observation.Can we get at some of this from the clearings [data]?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have data on some of this and wehave done some analysis, good or bad, that takes as its point ofdeparture how many checks, the value of checks written, or the valueof turnover and says: If that is representative of a transactionsaccount and has a normal turnover of an individual's checking account,x amount of the money market funds are like M1. And it came out toabout a little less than 2 percent the last time we--MR. KOHN. It was 4 percent, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, 4 percent of the money market funds,but adding 2 percent or a little less than 2 percent or a little lessthan 1 percent is a very [unintelligible]. There are all kinds ofquestions that can be raised about the methodology. There is someturnover to savings accounts that we don't put in at all; there issome turnover to CDs that we don't count at all. On the other hand,it makes no allowance for the fact that if somebody owns a moneymarket fund, even if he doesn't write any checks on it or doesn't takethe money out except rarely, the fact that he has it and knows he canwrite a check on it induces him to hold a lower cash balance than hewould otherwise keep. Now, how do we measure that? I think it is-43-12/21-22/81basically immeasurable, and it is undoubtedly there. We have aspectrum of assets and we are trying to draw an arbitrary line throughit and say this much is M1 and that much is M2 or M3; in fact thearbitrary line doesn't mean anything because it's a spectrum. Iunderstand the frustration. We ought to know all that we can knowabout it; but in fact we are dealing with a spectrum and there isn'tany answer. Nothing is going to fall neatly into what is M1 and M2and M3. We'd have a little trouble if we sat around this table tryingto rationalize the distinction between M2 and M3 and M3 and L. Anysense that after that discussion we're going to get a clean,conceptual difference between these Ms I'm afraid is an illusion.MS. TEETERS. But the troublesome thing about the moneymarket mutual funds is that the data we're getting on low turnover andall the rest goes against what all of us hear that people are usingthese funds as checking accounts. My own sample indicated that 99percent were using them as checking accounts.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, that's the problem with turnover. Oneof the ways that people use the money market mutual funds is that theywrite a check at the end of the month against them and put it in theirchecking account and then write 20 checks against the one check. Andif you just measure turnover, you get one check.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But it's a big check in that case. Theonly explanation I have for the phenomenon that I think you correctlyobserved is that it is a mixture. A large portion of that isbasically savings or investment in the broader sense. Some fractionof it is transactions accounts. That is the nature of it. M1 is only$400 billion and M3 is $2 trillion or whatever it is. And moneymarket funds are an indistinguishable blend of the two.MS. TEETERS. Then what do we do when everything becomesmoney market funds?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Precisely, we don't know. I am sayingthat I think it's a little difficult, however much study we give this,to say we're going to come up with a number that says this portion ofit is M1 and this portion of it is M2 because it doesn't come thatway. It doesn't come in that kind of package.MR. WALLICH. It doesn't have to come into the money marketfund. Merrill Lynch lets you draw checks against your securities andputs the money into a bank account that has a money market fundassociated with it; that fund is up to $12 billion now. You can drawa check for fifteen cents.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I am not arguing at all over this;obviously, we should get as much information about this phenomenon aswe can. I just think people are suggesting more than is practicallyfeasible to say that we are going to have some great study and somehowthe numbers are going to come fluttering down and on this half of thetable they are going to be M1 and on the other half they are going tobe M2.MR. PARTEE. I couldn't agree more, Paul. It is veryanalogous to our difficulty in dealing with savings accounts overtime. Savings accounts have more turnover than money market funds and-44-12/21-22/81yet we never put any portion of savings accounts in M1. Indeed, wedidn't even blink an eye when [depository institutions] went frominterest figured on the minimum balance to interest from day ofdeposit to day of withdrawal, which was a big change in savingsaccounts. We never did a thing about it. I don't think we have everhandled the notion of savings accounts at all well in research that Ican recall, extending back into the 1950s, in terms of what to do withsavings accounts and how to treat their "moneyness" in looking atmonetary expansion. So, I think it is not really the turnover but[their use as a] backup that's terribly important. The differencebetween a money market fund which you can have immediate access to andan IRA account which you can't draw on until you're 59-1/2 years oldis really phenomenal, and yet they are both in M2.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me just inject a thought onIRAs. Conceptually, the argument is very strong, as I see it, to takethose out of M2 on liquidity grounds. But suppose we went ahead anddid that. What we don't know is how much money is going into IRAaccounts that otherwise would have been in M2 or is already in M2, sowe'd get an artificial deflation of M2 in an attempt to improve thefigure. In some long run sense it probably would be an improvedfigure, but it is not going to help us in 1982 in understanding M2, Isuspect.MR. WALLICH. You'd turn it into another M1-A.MR. CORRIGAN. You'd have a shift-adjusted M2.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's inherent in almost anything welook at. Where's the money coming from, right?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Right.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It can't stop us from--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But this is a reflection of a change inlaw. It's like the M1 adjustment problem.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's so clearly understandable byeverybody that there's a rationale for taking it out.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not arguing against taking it out.I'm just arguing against the notion that it will give us a cleananalytically nice figure when we take it out.MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, one more observation: I'd justlike to remind you that back in the mid-1970s we had one of theseveral Committees on the directive--some of us at this table servedon it--chaired first by Bob Holland and later by Chuck Partee. Wetook a long, hard look at optimal control, working on the ultimatevariables and not using money as the intermediate target. And the netof that was a dry hole. It just didn't prove to be doable inpractice. So, despite all of our frustrations about what money is,how it behaves, and what should be in M1 and M2, it is still the onlygame in town as far as I am concerned. Some of the academics--and itis a real minority--are urging us to target on real interest rates orto target on nominal GNP. They get little, if any, support from theirpeers. That came out loud and clear in this recent academic-45-12/21-22/81conference that I mentioned yesterday. Despite the frustrations aboutthe money supply--will the real money supply please stand up!--I thinkit's the only hope we have.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With that comforting thought, Mr. Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. Taking into account all this frustration,uncertainty, and credibility, which I don't think I can add to afterthis dinstinguished discussion, we still have to set some targets fornext year. I think John is right that we still have to deal withthese. I come down for lowering the M1 range to 2-1/2 to 5-1/2percent, which is what we tentatively agreed on in July. And I amsympathetic to the notion of raising M2. It does seem to me that weought to make these as consistent as we can. I don't think it adds toor subtracts from our credibility if we make an adjustment in M2 tomake it consistent with M1. So, I would favor such an adjustment.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. Well, just so we have everything in front of us,I also would like to point out that there is the problem of choosingthe base in doing next year's targeting. We've rather easily slippedover the fact that there was a considerable shortfall in M1-B thisyear. In fact, Jerry had an interesting explanation for it--and Ithink it's something we ought to work on--that involves a 2-year lookat the expansion of M1-B. But there are a good many people who havebeen greatly afflicted by high interest rates and poor business andbankruptcy who won't quite understand why it is that we just disregardthe shortfall entirely and go on and assign the same old lower growthrate to M1 in the year to come. I think it is a very serious problemthat we have to deal with in explaining, if that is what we want todo, why it is what we want to do. Most people would say we ought toadd our shortfall in 1981 into the 1982 expectations.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But last year didn't you accept thebase drift in Ml?MR. PARTEE. Yes, but it didn't involve bankruptcy the way itdoes now. I am talking about builders and realtors and people likethat who just aren't going to understand it and quite a fewCongressmen who already have begun to focus on this issue in lookingat 1982.MR. WINN. Chuck, what do you do with M2, then?MR. PARTEE. Well, I think most people would regard M2 as avery much lesser target of policy. That hasn't been the emphasis atall, for a very good reason in my view. Of course, we differ on that,but it is a problem we have to take into account now. It happens tobe most pointed in this particular Bluebook because in this Bluebookwe have the sense--and it was referred to earlier, I think, by Frankin a somewhat negative way--that we have a year in which we've fallenprogressively short in M1-B and we finally got 2 or 3 months that areup. October was a normative or maybe a slightly more than normativemonth; November was a little strong; and December is another sort ofnormative month. But choosing the fourth quarter as the base meansthat December is above the fourth-quarter average so that when we ask"How are we going to be on track for the first quarter?" we get very-46-12/21-22/81low money rate objectives, and everyone notices that. [Growth] isonly 1/2 or 2 percent, depending on which alternative one takes; thefact is that it is very hard to explain. We are still below targetand now we are talking about getting down to the new target in thisvery meeting, in the second part of this meeting that we are going tohave. It seems to me that's a very [unintelligible] representation ofthe problem we have.MR. ROOS. Chuck, doesn't the law say that we have to use thefourth quarter as a [base]?MR. PARTEE. No, the law doesn't say that. It says the year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would observe in this connection that Ilike to look at a somewhat longer perspective than these fourth-quarter [measures]. This doesn't deal with the short-run problem ofwhat to do when we have a sudden increase such as we have now. We endup with a high December and all the rest. But on an annual basis thetable on page 6 [of the Bluebook] in a sense is another way of lookingat what Jerry Corrigan was looking at; it overlaps, anyway. If youlook at these annual [growth rates] year over year, which are thenumber 2 figures here, [for M1-B] it's 8.2 percent in '78, downslightly in '79, down more in '80, and down more in '81. It's afairly smooth pattern, though you can argue that it's too much, toolittle, or whatever. But it doesn't give that extreme movement we getwith the fourth quarter figures because that reflects the obvious; infact we started high this year and ended up low [given] the decliningtrend during the year. Last year we did the opposite. When youaverage through the 12 months you get a reasonably smooth pattern.MR. PARTEE. Well, if we wanted to take that 4-1/2 percent[year-over-year growth] for '81 and have, say, 4 percent for '82 forthe annual average, I think we'd find that the quarterly growth ratewould have to be quite a bit more than that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Steve has done that calculation. If Iunderstand it correctly, if we stayed exactly on the target quarter byquarter at the 4 percent midpoint of this tentative range, the annualaverage also comes out to 4 percent.MR. AXILROD. Yes, it's tricky because that's the actual M1not shift-adjusted over last year's regular M1, so it works outfortuitously that way.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But what's the meaning of that? It comesout considerably higher if you measure the actual M1 in '82 over theshift-adjusted in '81.MR. AXILROD. No, in '81 the year over year not shift-adjusted so-called M1 grew [6.9] percent, so we would get that goingdown to 4.0 percent. And the shift-adjusted M1 grew 4-1/2 percent,and we get that going down to 4.0 percent. So we really are getting ayear-over-year drop.MR. PARTEE. I see.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure I fully understand how wecome out on the number 2 basis but any way we do it I take it that if-47-12/21-22/81we stayed on path, we'd come out with another drop year over year onthis tentative target.MR. AXILROD. If it was exactly a 4 percent increase month bymonth after the first quarter, with a little slower growth in thefirst quarter, it would come out at 4 percent on this measure.MR. GRAMLEY. I wonder if anybody has noticed how beautifullywe have come out by way of the performance of nominal GNP in terms ofdeceleration. Page I-V in the Greenbook shows the fourth-quarterchanges. Starting from 1979 it shows 9.9 to 9.4 to 9.1 to 8.6percent. Now, that is about as good a target for nominal GNP as onecan possibly imagine--fortuitous, but very well balanced.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where am I here? Has everybody said allthey want to say on this particular subject? I am not sure I heard anenormous range of opinion on the targets themselves. There is somedisagreement about what to do with M2. I have a great deal ofsympathy with the subject that Frank particularly emphasized andothers have too. I must say I have a great deal of sympathy with thefrustrations in defining the numbers and knowing what they mean. Idon't extend my sympathy to a great antipathy about or not worryingabout interest rates. I think that is the obvious modification thatone might introduce into our procedures in the absence of some magicalother statistic. I think we have had a problem with interest rates.If anything, we probably should have paid more attention to themrather than less, I'd say. That's a personal reaction anyway. Itcertainly is not driving me back to being more precise about numbersthat I don't understand.Let me give you the nature of the problem that I see in M1. Ithink some day, conceptually, if we didn't have any statisticalproblems, this demand shift that we keep talking about might go inreverse. If people had more confidence in the currency and lowerinterest rates and we got interest rates paid on transactions accountsthat would be by regulation or in practice much closer to marketrates, we might find some day that we had to have a decidedly fastergrowth of M1 relative to nominal increases in GNP or other magnitudes.I don't think we are there yet. But some day that is going to happen.Apart from that, what do we say about M1 next year? I could see itrepeating [this year's experience] as some people have said, but itcould go either way so far as I know, for purely institutionalreasons. If interest rates continue to decline, if the economy weresomewhat on the soft, depressed side, if the ceiling rates go up ontransaction-type accounts, we might get a big expansion in M1 relativeto what we otherwise would contemplate or relative to past patternsbecause of money flows, particularly into NOW accounts, that otherwisemight have been lodged elsewhere. [That assumes] we don't get theaggressive competition from money market funds, we have a [markedlyupward sloping] yield curve, and short-term rates are getting downtoward what institutions can pay. On the other hand, if interestrates remain relatively high, which might occur with a fairly strongeconomy relative to projections, we could get a great spread of sweepsinto money market fund accounts, with practically every bank in thecountry offering that service. M1 could get very depressed relativeto other economic magnitudes. I don't know which way it will go.-48-12/21-22/81We all want to be very precise about the money supply targetand that's fine. The effectiveness of that target may be more alteredby a decision that we have to make as to whether we are going topermit sweeping of accounts or not than by the decision we make as towhere to put the precise target. We have to face that decision, whichwill be a very difficult one. But I think we probably will have quitea different situation if there is no sweeping than if this [practice]catches on like wildfire. There was something in the paper thismorning about the Fidelity fund being all set up to do this with alarge group of Midwestern banks. I don't know what the implicationsof that will be but I suspect things will be different whether it'spermitted to take place or not to take place. I have a rather strongbias under these circumstances not to be more precise than we reallycan be in setting the targets and not to put all the weight on onemonetary aggregate either because I find it very useful to look atmore than one, whatever we say about the targets, in trying tounderstand what is going on in these very complex and difficultcircumstances in which we live.On the substantive side, where I think greater problems lie,we may have an insoluble problem. It is not impossible and may evenbe likely, apart from the short-run question, that we will have theimmediate problem of a recession and not want to aggravate that andwant to facilitate recovery and all the rest. In that process, Idon't think we can forget about what happens when the economy turnsaround and begins to rise again. If it does, we will just run intoanother blank wall on sharply rising interest rates--with precipitousincreases in money market rates and long-term rates, not justreflecting what is going on but in anticipation of budgetary deficitsand economic recovery and restrictive monetary policy--and I'm notsure we will have served the country well. We have to think a bitabout strategies to minimize that possibility; we can't eliminate it.The reason the problem may be insoluble is that the only way we arereally going to deal with this, I suspect, apart from the budgetaryconsideration, is to convince people that we have a hold on inflationand have created a climate in which interest rates, particularly long-term rates, will tend to go down. But how do we create that climateand that expectation without in some sense risking being overly tightin the short run? And because people are so skeptical about whetherthat is going to happen, the long-term rates won't come down fastenough to facilitate the recovery we want. To what degree can weovercome that by being "easier" in terms of the money supply? Maybethat will scare people even more and work against the objective ofcreating a climate in which interest rates aren't going to bounce upagain as soon as the economy turns around. I am not entirelydiscouraged about this because I think, particularly starting where weare with interest rates so high, there is a possibility thatconfidence will return more rapidly than we could imagine now. So wecould get a situation where the economy could turn around consistentwith declines in interest rates, if we can get the economy turnedaround at all. But I think that is the chance we have to play for.Well, I don't know that we are going to be all that far apartin the mechanics. On this question that Governor Partee raised, wecould broaden that a little as to whether there is any better way ofpresenting our targets. How we deal with base drift is one aspect ofthat. I don't have any brilliant suggestions but it may be worth alittle further thought. We have to deal with this immediate problem-49-12/21-22/81in setting the short-run target. I don't know that we can go anyfurther on the discussion of the long run. This has been useful insome ways. We will obviously return to it and will have to resolve itin early February. Why don't you present the short-term issues,Steve, and then we'll have a coffee break.MR. AXILROD. If I might take a minute before I do that, Idid look up the answer to the question that President Morris raised ofwhether we have ever had rapid growth in M1, such as the 4-1/2 percentrate of growth we are having in the fourth quarter, with a markeddeceleration of the economy, where it is going down as it is thisquarter at a 5-1/2 percent rate. There are a surprising number ofquarters of negative growth in the economy and positive growth inmoney--I am talking about on a quarterly average basis. There wereeven quarters where we had a deceleration and then an acceleration ofmoney, surprisingly enough. For example, in the second quarter of1979 real GNP was [minus] 1-3/4 percent after being plus [3.9] percentin the first quarter, and money growth went from 5-1/2 in the firstquarter to 10 percent in the second quarter. Similarly, in the thefirst quarter of '74 real GNP had dropped at around a 4 percent annualrate after rising at a 3-1/4 percent rate in the fourth quarter of'73, and money growth accelerated from 4.8 to 6.7 percent. So it isnot an extremely infrequent occurrence that something like thathappens and, of course, we are aiming at it this time.MR. WALLICH. Money is supposed to lead the economy with along and variable lag.MR. AXILROD. This is only quarter to quarter. I didn'ttrace out the averages. I was just responding to the question.MR. MORRIS. The examples you gave were all relativelyrecent.MR. AXILROD. But it's even the case going back.MR. ROOS. I wonder, Steve, if you compared the quarterlyrate of money growth to the trend rate, if there is any instance wherewe had two quarters of M1-B growth falling below the trend rate wherewe haven't had a significant downturn in economic activity.MR. AXILROD. Well, that is a different question. I was justresponding to the question that President Morris raised of whetherwithin a quarter we had had this kind of movement. Our observation isthat it's not as rare as one might have thought it would be.Mr. Chairman, we designed the short-run alternatives on thebasis of the tentative range of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent that theCommittee had set for M1-B and on the basis of the Committee'sprevious practice of, in effect, shifting the base to the actual levelof money. Alternative A was designed to hit the upper end of that2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range, alternative C to hit the lower end, andalternative B to be in between by March. It is a fairly mechanicalsetting of the ranges. Thus, from the fourth-quarter average that wesuggested as a base, the growth rate for alternative A is 5-1/2percent, the upper end of the range. That [took account of] how theCommittee has set short-run ranges before. Our thought was thatDecember as a base is somewhat unstable because we don't know the-50-12/21-22/81number yet. If it did come out as we are projecting, the impliedgrowth rates are so low that they raise the possibility of beingsubject to some misinterpretation when put out in the directive. Analternative way of doing it would be to make the base November, whichthe Committee has done before, and the growth rates for alternativesA, B, and C would be about 0.3 lower. That is, the 5-1/2 percent withNovember as a base would be 5.2 percent to hit the upper end of therange; and that 0.3 would extend across all of the other alternatives.That, as I say, the Committee has done one time before.MR. CORRIGAN. That would be November-to-March then, Steve?MR. AXILROD. Yes. With regard to the implications of thesealternatives for credit markets (and assuming less of a demand shift,so to speak, than took place in 1981) our analysis suggested that theodds were--unless the economy was considerably weaker than is beingprojected--that there would be not much room for further interest ratedeclines under either alternatives B or C, which call for really quitemodest growth in money consistent with the Committee's long-run range.Under alternative A it looked to us as if there was more of apossibility for declines in interest rates given the GNP projection.So, in a sense, one way of putting it is that the Committee's choicewould be to set a target depending on how it tends to lean in itsattitude toward credit markets at this time, before the recovery hasstarted. To the degree that the Committee wishes to give a littleimpetus to easing in credit markets in order to encourage therecovery, that tends to argue, of course, for the more liberal [fourthquarter to March] alternative within the Committee's range. To thedegree that the Committee would want to leave more room for expansionlater and believes the recovery has enough momentum and can turnaround on its own, that tends to argue for an alternative of lowergrowth, leaving a little more room later to finance the expansion asit develops.I should mention one other point, Mr. Chairman, with regardto the borrowing assumption. We have assumed borrowing in alternativeB of around $450 million, which is a little higher than we haveactually attained in recent weeks. Again, to the degree that theCommittee wants to lean toward a little easing in credit markets insetting its monetary target, consideration could be given to loweringthat more toward the levels of borrowing that are suggested foralternative A, which would be around $250 million. That leaves arange, obviously, in between.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me make a couple of quick commentsjust in terms of presentation. I am not crazy about that firstalternative in the Bluebook, [shifting the base] from a quarterlyaverage to a monthly number. That looks a little awkward to me and Irecoil a bit. I don't like the December-to-March approachparticularly because we don't yet know December. It seems to me wehave done that before and then gotten mixed up by the fact thatDecember, or whatever the last month in the quarter was, didn't comein the way we expected. This leaves me thinking that maybe theNovember-to-March method of looking at it is the most fruitful. Thisis just arithmetic in presentation.On the substance, I find myself thinking these numbers meansomething quite different if in fact we continue to get sizable growth-51-12/21-22/81because NOW accounts are bulging--and we don't quite know why but itmay be [related to] this interpretation of a temporary parking place--than if NOW accounts are not bulging the way they have been in thelast few weeks. I guess that's all I have in the way of preliminarycomments. Why don't we have coffee.[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me make one other comment just to setthe stage for what we're talking about and to give us a due sense ofhumility. If I recall the discussion correctly at the last meeting, Idon't think anybody around the table--I certainly speak for myself--had any conviction that, almost regardless of what we did, we weregoing to have high money supply figures in the period from the lastmeeting to this meeting. Everybody was worried that whatever numberwe put down we might fall way short even if interest rates declined.Instead, we had interest rates tending to be under a little morepressure in the money market and the money supply figures movingsignificantly in excess of the target we put down. I don't think thatis a tragedy. I am just saying that is an indication of the [limited]degree of precision that we have in setting the target for a one-monthperiod; whatever effects there will be on the money supply in the nextmonth are probably already [determined] in the market, rather than bywhat we do today. But we are setting a money supply target here for aquarter. Let's proceed with the discussion. Is there a generalagreement that we ought to use November as a presentational base?SEVERAL. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It may just make it a bit less confusingif we--MR. MORRIS. Paul, how would that influence the money growthnumbers?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's just what Steve said. Ifyou're looking at the fourth quarter-to-March numbers, take off 0.3 toget the equivalent number on M1. I don't know what it does--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. On M2 the numbers are 9.8, 8.9, and8.1 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Those are the equivalent numbers?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Those are the equivalent numbersaccording to our calculations.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just write those down.MR. BALLES. Say them again.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Taking the November base to March,for alternative A M2 is 9.8 percent, alternative B is 8.9 percent, andalternative C is 8.1 percent.MR. BALLES. How about M1?-52-12/21-22/81VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. M1, as Steve said, is 5.2, 3.7, and2.2 percent.MR. BALLES. Right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What I would recommend, Mr. Chairman,is taking the November base and liberalizing alternative B somewhat byrounding up the 3.7 to 4 percent. I'd start with around $350 millionof initial borrowing and lower the fed funds rate range by 1 point,which would bring it down to 10 to 14 percent or we could use 10 to15 percent if we want to go back to the 5-point spread.MR. PARTEE. Tony, the 4 percent is the quarterly average?Is that what you're explaining?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, it's November to March.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Which is a liberalization of "B."MR. FORD. You're saying make the fed funds range 10 to 15percent, Tony?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Or 10 to 14 percent.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Either 10 to 14 or 10 to 15 percent,I don't care. There's some advantage in changing that range from timeto time whether it's 4 points or 5 points. I don't feel stronglyabout that. But I do think the lower end of it ought to be lowered by1 point and that the initial borrowing ought to be around $350million.MR. MORRIS. Sounds like a Solomonic judgment!MR. SCHULTZ. I'll vote for that.MR. PARTEE. What was your M2 number?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, the M2 number then becomesaround 9 percent. It's 8.9 percent technically, but if we round upthe 3.7 on M1-B to 4 percent then it would be shading M2 to a littlemore than 9 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Gramley.MR. GRAMLEY. I'd like to say first that I don't thinkanything we do here today is going to help this recession come to anend soon. It's going to run its course for a while. I do believethat if we are not careful in the selection of where we go, we coulddraw out the recession and make it longer. Therefore, I want to avoidany alternative that would result in rising interest rates at thisstage. I think that would be a grave mistake. What we ought to beaiming for is to set the stage for a recovery later this spring butone of moderate dimensions. We ought to be very careful to avoid thekind of problems we got into in 1980. I'm cognizant of the enormous-53-12/21-22/81uncertainties we face in interpreting the monetary aggregates, notonly in the long run because of these tremendous innovational changesbut also the point you made earlier, Mr. Chairman, that we havesomething going on here in the OCD area that we ought to be awfullycareful with. I would opt for alternative B. I could live with asomewhat lower borrowing level, but $450 million or $400 to $450million is acceptable. I would say, however, that in addition toadopting the specs of "B" for growth rates of M1 and M2 we ought to bewilling to live with a larger increase in M1-B if it results from thekind of increase in OCDs we've been seeing recently, which we have areasonable basis for interpreting. This parking of funds while thereis uncertainty is clear.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just as a matter of clarification, whenyou say "B," are you willing to accept something like Mr. Solomon's[numbers]?MR. GRAMLEY. Yes, that's all right; I would go with that.MR. WALLICH. You know that when we set something and accepta higher amount that it has the effect, really, of pegging the fundsrate. Is that what you want?MR. GRAMLEY. I tried not to use--MR. PARTEE. He doesn't want interest rates to go up.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I think there's a difference ofview among the technical people as to whether initial borrowing of$350 million means a lower rate or the same rate as we've been seeinglately. Borrowings have been running on average less than the $450million. We might ask both Steve and Peter to comment on what theythink the implications are.MR. AXILROD. We've assumed in the Bluebook that if the pathwere $450 million and it was successfully hit, probably there would besome little upward tick in the funds rate, but maybe not a lot. Iwould assume that $350 million at a minimum would probably avoid that;whether that would cause the funds rate to drop initially, I feel moreagnostic about.MR. STERNLIGHT. I wouldn't disagree with that. I would tendto think of something like $250 million of borrowing as perhaps likelyto keep the funds rate just around the discount rate, $350 millionmaybe 1/4 percentage point over it, and $450 million a little more--maybe 1/2 point--over it.MS. TEETERS. To what extent does the discount rate act as afloor?MR. STERNLIGHT. The discount rate becomes a kind of anchoraround which the funds rate clusters once there's enough borrowing tomake that discount rate meaningful. If there's so little borrowingthat a great majority of banks hardly ever [come to] the discountwindow, then the discount rate isn't too meaningful and we fall intothis zone of indeterminacy. I don't know whether it's $200 or $250million or what, but once there's something like that level ofborrowing then there will be enough borrowing so that the discount-54-12/21-22/81window is a meaningful alternative that a number of banks want toavoid; they will be willing to pay the rate in the funds market ratherthan come to the window. And the more of that borrowing gap there is,the more demand for funds there will be by banks that want to stayaway from the window; so, they'd be willing to pay up a little higherin order to stay away [from the window].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I find very little to disagree within either Lyle's or Tony's statement, and since it sounds a littlepoetic I'll say that I'll just go with the wisdom of Solomon.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ford.MR. FORD. I want everybody to know that I am the one whofirst said that I don't think anybody here is wise enough to determineinterest rates except Solomon! I, too, tend to agree with him. Thisis getting to be easy except that I'd like to reinforce one point hemade and that relates to the fed funds rate range. If I read theGreenbook forecast correctly, the staff is saying that in the firstquarter of next year we're going to have a negative GNP of 2.2percent, a GNP deflator of under 7 percent, and unemploymentapproaching 9 percent. And with a GNP deflator that low, other priceindexes are probably going to be down. We're talking about realinterest rates on average in those three alternatives of 5 percent on"A," 6 percent on "B," and 7 percent on "C." I think we should atleast allow the possibility of seeing [real] interest rates get intothe single digit range at the nadir of this deep recession. So, I'dargue for "B" with a wider fed funds range, maybe going from [a lowerlimit of] 9 percent and centering on the present rate, which Iunderstand is just over 12 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. I am comfortable with Mr. Solomon's variationof "B," although I'd like to think of the initial borrowing as morelike $400 million or maybe a bit higher rather than the $350 millionthat Tony suggested just because I'd still like to leave a little roomdown the road. But, basically, I'd go along with something like Mr.Solomon's suggestion.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. Well, I have no difficulty with the funds rangethat you specified Tony, of 10 to 14 percent. We're right about atthe midpoint of it now and that assumes that it might drift a littlelower but not very much, at least initially. I don't know but I thinkeither $350 or $400 million on borrowing would be all right. I'dcertainly accept the $350 million. I do think that your objectivesfor M1 and M2 are pretty stingy. Page 2 of the Bluebook shows aSeptember-to-Deceber increase in M1-B shift-adjusted of 6.3 percent.Now, that has benefitted some from the shift adjustment; that is, Idon't have an M1 figure here. But if it weren't shift-adjusted, itwould be somewhat higher than that--7-1/2 percent or something likethat.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What are you looking at?-55-12/21-22/81MR. PARTEE. I am looking at page 2; I can't work with thesealternatives which don't have the correct figures on that. So I amtrying to look at what experience has been recently as against whatwe're plotting for the period ahead. It shows an increase fromSeptember to December--but if anything December is raising it just alittle--and that goes into our numbers that we're calculating lookingahead as maybe something like 7-1/2 percent in M1 as newly defined and12-1/2 percent in M2. You are cutting those to 4 and 9 percent.That's a pretty sharp cut in the growth rate compared with what wehave been experiencing recently. And I think that's too abrupt. Iwould prefer an M1 of 5 percent and an M2 of 10 percent as a centerpoint for November to March. I don't think anybody would be surprisedat that or regard it as being unduly expansive; in fact they mightregard it as being pretty restrictive compared with recent experienceand [given] the shortfall we've had.MR. BOEHNE. What was your M1, Chuck?MR. PARTEE. Five. I am just picking it almost out of theair but a 5 percent M1 seems to me like a normative M1; and if we took5 percent and 10 percent for the two numbers, that's really quite abit less [growth] than we've had recently in both M1 and M2.MS. TEETERS. Well, if we have a big December; this is aNovember-to-March number.MR. PARTEE. That will mean even less in the course [of the4-month period]; and we'll review it again in early February. Theother thing I'd just comment on is that I don't know what to make ofthose NOW accounts. I'm inclined to think it is an error in theseasonal adjustment but I am not sure. It could be that there is abig build-up in precautionary balances in NOW accounts, as the staffsays, and that might well continue right on through the winter if thatis the case.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, it might be temporary parkingfor Christmas.MR. PARTEE. Well, that's right. And that is why I think[the explanation] may be the seasonal. The seasonal doesn't have theadvantage of knowing what those household accounts have done in pastyears.MR. SCHULTZ. Or a temporary parking for IRA-Keoghs.MR. PARTEE. Or just temporary parking because people arescared they may lose their jobs.MR. BLACK. That is right.MR. PARTEE. You know, it makes a difference. I think Lyleis right that we want to watch that carefully to see whether [NOWaccounts] continue to be the source of strength in M1 and regard thata little differently than if it is in corporate balances or intraditional demand accounts where one might think that a build-upwould be a predecessor, as Larry likes to say, to an expansion inactivity, which also could be the case. We might be right on the edgeof a recovery in the economy and not know it. But it is just not-5612/21-22/81clear to me which is the case. Nevertheless, my basic point is that 4and 9 percent are so far below what we recently have had that they aretoo low to shoot for, and I would rather have 5 and 10 percent butwith your parameters on the funds rate and initial borrowings, Tony.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. I'd prefer something between "A" and "B," and Ican't get excited whether it's Tony's or Chuck's [formulation]. I dohave stronger feelings about the funds range; I think it ought to be10 to 14 percent. I would look with considerable disfavor if thefunds rate rose; I could accept some decline. And somewhere betweenthe $350 and $400 million range on borrowings makes sense.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. Generally I come out in favor of "B+," abouthalfway between those two revised numbers, starting with November [asthe base]. I share the concern that Lyle and some others haveexpressed that this recession might be worse than the staff is nowforecasting. If there is an error, it is likely to be on the side ofthe recession being deeper through the first quarter than both ourstaff and the Board's staff have suggested. And for that reason Iwould agree with Bill Ford on the federal funds rate range. I'dprefer to see the bottom of it as low as 9 percent, and I would notlike to see us strongly resist the decline in interest rates thatwould accompany a really soft economy. So I'd accept either 9 to 14or 9 to 15 percent on the funds rate range. And as far as theborrowing assumption is concerned, $350 to $400 million would be okaywith me.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Wallich.MR. WALLICH. Well, I find myself leaning toward the easyside this time because what we have done is to avoid following theaggregates as far as we might; had we done so, interest rates would bea lot lower. Not having done that, I think we ought to give theeconomy a chance to recover at this interest rate level and try tostring that [level] out as long as it will last, giving [firms] achance to issue more bonds and so on. I would not welcome a furtherdrop unless the economy weakens substantially because that wouldsimply be what I think has been the error that we have avoided in thefirst place. But we have to compensate somewhat for not having letrates drop that far by now smoothing them out for the future. So, Iwould go with the higher aggregate [growth rates] proposed--that is M1at 5 percent and M2 at 10 percent, a low borrowing assumption of $250or $300 million, and a funds rate range of 10 to 14 percent. Iwouldn't see any advantage in letting fed funds get into the single-digit range; I'd try to hold it here for a while if circumstancespermit. There is a cost to this; later in the year we may have toaccept higher interest rates to stick by our overall targets. Thatcost I think we have to be prepared to pay.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.MR. KEEHN. I'd be comfortable with Mr. Solomon's proposalfor both M1 and M2, given the current state of the economy, with thethought that a little reduction in the fed funds rate might provide-57-12/21-22/81some encouragement. I'd be in favor of a $350 to $400 millionborrowing range and a federal funds target range of 10 to 14 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.MR. GUFFEY. I'd be comfortable with Mr. Solomon's proposalwith one exception. It is maybe a fence-riding caveat. I amconcerned about interest rates rising and, to ensure against that, Iwould like to suggest that we adopt the modified "B" as Tony hassuggested, with $400 million borrowing but by the same token have anunderstanding that if money in January begins to come in a bitstronger than projected, there wouldn't be any overt action taken thatwould result in higher interest rates until we got to [M1 growth] atabout the "A" level. In other words, we'd have a range, if you will,of 4 to 5 percent M1 growth under that kind of proposal before theDesk would alter the path that was set based upon a November base.Also I'd favor a federal funds range of 10 to 14 percent, whichprovides a bit of insurance that we would have a consultation if thefunds rate begins to rise early in the period.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters.MS. TEETERS. Well, I can endorse Tony's suggestion, whichwas modified by Roger, Chuck, and others. If you look at it visually,we need something more than 4 percent [M1 growth] to come in ontarget. So, if we take Roger's suggestion of 4 percent for M1 and use9 percent for M2, a funds range of 10 to 14 percent, and borrowing of$350 million with the understanding that if M1 growth begins to go upwe won't try to restrain it if it means a rise in interest rates, thatwould be a perfectly acceptable decision for me.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I am not quite sure about one comment youmade. What you are suggesting is low relative to the targets, as Iunderstand this, because if you are talking about next year's target,it is right on it.MS. TEETERS. No, I am talking about Chuck's point that bygoing from November to March we have a December which is probablygoing to be above November and we have a high first month in there sowe may need a little leeway to accommodate for the fact that Decemberis coming in above the November level.MR. PARTEE. If you look specifically at the staff's numberson page 12 for M1 under alternative B, which is about what Tony had inmind, that calls for a December of 8 percent and then a January andFebruary of 2.2 percent in each month.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Well, that's reflected in the secondpart of page 11.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I should say that New York, for whatit's worth, has a lower projection for December.MR. PARTEE. Well, it is very hard to know what December willbe. There is some exposure here to having to seek quite low numbers.MS. TEETERS. If we need a little leeway, we could have aconference.-58-12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roos.MR. ROOS. As a means of achieving growth in M1 next year of5 percent, for the reasons I attempted to enunciate yesterday, I wouldfavor the alternative A choice. I wouldn't jump off the bridge if youadopted Tony Solomon's "B+;" I would be happier on Christmas Eve if wedid widen that funds range a little, maybe to 9 to 14 percent orsomething like that. A $350 to $400 million borrowing assumptionwould be consistent with this, I think.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I would want to rush to supportGovernor Wallich's proposal while I can, for the reasons given byGovernor Partee.MR. PARTEE. It seldom happens!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends.MR. PARTEE. I want to be associated with those remarks andI'd like to join Governor Wallich, too.MR. RICE. I would say 5 percent for M1 and 10 percent forM2, borrowing of, say, $350 million, and on the funds range 10 to 14percent.MR. FORD. I didn't hear that. Could somebody repeat it?MR. RICE. I said borrowing at $350 million and a funds rangeof 10 to 14. Did you hear what I said about M1 and M2?MR. FORD. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have no more volunteers. Mr. Winn.MR. WINN. I would take to heart your caution that we betterlook down the road in terms of the short-term target as well as justthe immediate problem. And I would go along with the 4 and 9 percenton the aggregates because they're in line with our longer-rangetargets. [For the funds range] 10 to 14 percent is fine. On theother hand, if the aggregates should come in stronger, a littleincrease in the rates, not a major one, would not bother me as awarning in terms of what lies ahead. So, I would not be upset, if theaggregates were strong, to see a little firming in rates as a warningto what the fall may hold for us.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have a few precincts that haven't beenheard from.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I'll do it quickly. The $350 million andthe 10 to 14 percent I think are fine. I prefer 4 and 9 percent [forthe aggregates] because I don't believe we're going to have a greatdeal of problem with that. My feeling is that there's a risk in theeconomy that tends to be on the down side and I just don't understandthe OCDs. I don't know, but my gut feeling is that [the recession] isnot going to continue forever, so I don't feel that we are going tohave much of a problem. On the other hand, if we do have some-59-12/21-22/81problem, I wouldn't mind seeing us have a little leeway on the up sidethere. I am perfectly willing to tolerate a little stronger growthdepending upon what happens in the economy and what happens tointerest rates.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.MR. BOYKIN. I'm trying to remember the numbers Tony gaveoriginally. I don't think I got them down right.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You want all the decimals?MR. BOYKIN. No.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [For M1 and M2] 4 and 9 percent and 10 to14 [for the funds range].MR. BOYKIN. Okay. That's what I wanted to be sure of. Yes,I would find that acceptable.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is for November to March, right?MR. BOYKIN. Yes, I would find that acceptable.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris and Mr. Black haven't beenheard from. No, I have Mr. Morris and Mr. Black down.MR. BLACK. I've said something but apparently it didn't--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm ahead of the Secretary. I guesseverybody has been heard from. We obviously don't have any very bigdifferences here. Where has borrowing been in the last three weeks?MR. AXILROD. I'll give you the precise numbers in just asecond. It has been running about $340 million this week so far andthat would be about the average. For the week of the 16th it was $268million; for the 9th, $493 million; for the 2nd, $192 million; andbefore that, $214 million. [For that period] we were expectingborrowing of $400 million or higher.MR. GRAMLEY. Wasn't this partly a consequence of very littledemand for excess reserves?MR. AXILROD. Well, initially. But excess reserves wererevised upward successively as the weeks passed. They ran a littlelow in two out of the first three weeks and were very high in one ofthem, so they averaged [close to expectations] in the first threeweeks and then were very low last week. Last week [excess] wasnegative; I don't how it's coming out this week. It didn't turn outto be nearly as low as it looked at the beginning because we got "as-of" adjustments subsequently.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I only have some very limited substantivecomments to add to what has been said. A premise of a lot of thecomments was that nobody's dying to see interest rates rise at thispoint. And there's a certain sense that people would feel a littlemore comfortable with a decline, I suppose, if I can summarize theatmosphere. In that connection a number of people commented that they-60-12/21-22/81are not going to be upset by a slightly higher growth rate in theaggregates. Nobody mentioned the opposite, which I would now mention.If interest rates really softened, I wouldn't be all that disturbedabout some shortfall from any of these numbers we are talking aboutif, and I emphasize this, interest rates were declining in any verypronounced way during this particular period.MS. TEETERS. What if the decline in the real economy in thefirst quarter continues at the rate in the fourth quarter? [Interestrates] undoubtedly would be softer.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it didn't happen in the last part ofNovember and December. I just don't know. It depends upon that funnydemand for money that we can't fully explain in the very short run. Iwould agree with you that it is not likely [to continue] over a longerperiod of time, but I don't know what is going to happen in the veryshort run.I wonder whether [my summary] is consistent in substance withwhat everybody in varying degrees seems to be saying. Well, let meapproach the funds rate first, where there isn't much disagreement. Iwould think 10 to 14 percent makes a lot of sense just in terms of theform. We're about in the middle of that now range and it allows [adecline of] 2 percentage point or slightly more in the federal fundsrate. I don't say that with any feeling that 10 percent ought to bean absolute floor in any sense; it hasn't been in the past and thisseems a logical range to put down. Almost everybody has said thatwith some exceptions. I guess everybody on the Committee has saidthat. I have no problem with that. I wonder a little whether theborrowing level that people were talking about isn't a little high interms of the balance of risks and possibilities here. I'd be a littlemore comfortable with, let's say, a $300 million number than the $350or $350 to $400 million that people mentioned, considering where weare now and considering this average pattern in the past, in order toprovide a little more assurance that rates are not going to rise evenif these numbers come in more or less as projected. So, I would raisethat question.We have a clear majority for around 4 and 9 percent [for M1and M2] on a November-to-March basis. In any event, I think thatwould be interpreted, if that's where we alight, as our not beingunduly concerned by a somewhat higher number than that. If we putdown a higher number, I'd feel more strongly that if it came in lowerand interest rates were declining appreciably, we shouldn't push anyharder than necessary just to hit the 5 and 10 percent numbers. Butthe 4 and 9 percent numbers suit me all right with the understandingthat we're not going to be very upset by some overrun and startingwith a slightly lower borrowing number than the weight of opinion hassuggested here. I'm just a little worried about that borrowing numberbeing a bit too high. And I think we do [need to] interpret thesenumbers--I don't know how to put that in the directive--somehow in thelight of what is going on in NOW accounts, if we can make any sense ofit, as opposed to a general increase.MR. PARTEE. We have been carrying 7 percent for months asour objective on Ml-B.MS. TEETERS. You feel so sure on this.-61-12/21-22/81MR. PARTEE. Yes, there's some room to bring it down.MR. SCHULTZ. That [depends on] the initial borrowing number.What happens initially with that borrowing?MR. AXILROD. Well, I don't think much.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think anything much would happen.MR. AXILROD. I think the funds rate would stay somewhatabove the discount rate at that level of borrowing. When borrowing inthe first two weeks of this intermeeting period was around $200million, the funds rate was a little below the then discount rate.And in the next week borrowing was $493 million, followed by $268million and thus far this week $330 million or so, and the funds ratehas been about 1/2 point above the discount rate. So, it's probably alittle above--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is obviously a fine judgment, but I'dworry a little about forcing the funds rate on the high side of whereit has been or maybe even a little higher than where it has been, asopposed to making sure it doesn't rise in the very short run. I'm noteven sure $300 million makes that [certain], but it's just a questionof where we want to take the risks. My feel for the situation is thatit is more consistent with the comments I hear around the table aboutnot wanting an increase in the funds rate right out of the box or noteven wanting it if money growth gets a little higher.MR. CORRIGAN. So 4 and 9 percent would be the numbers in thedirective?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, in that interpretation, I think we'dsay something in the directive--I haven't got any wording--MR. BOEHNE. Or somewhat higher?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think I want to bias it to thatextent but [I'd include] some language that this takes carefulinterpretation of the NOW account situation. Maybe that's hard to do;I haven't worked out any language. But whatever the directive says,that is what we mean.MS. TEETERS. We could do it by saying "around" 4 and 9percent and let that--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, having "around" is fine with me andtaking account of or analyzing the figures in light of the fact thatthese are not shift-adjusted and have a big NOW account component.That's not good language, but that's--MR. BLACK. And praying a lot!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On the other hand, if we went with aslightly higher number, I'd also put in the directive that this istaking account of the fact--and we can do it this way too--that we arenot using a shift-adjusted number and that the discrepancy has beenquite large recently and we assume it's going to continue to besizable. So, theoretically, we can do it either way. It will be hard-62-12/21-22/81to get that language in there but [we need] some allusion to theproblem that we're moving from a shift-adjusted number. We have had along [explanation in] parentheses in the directive that we weretalking about a shift-adjusted number; now I think we need a long [onein] parentheses that we're not.MR. CORRIGAN. Is that an illusion or elusion?MR. PARTEE. It made a three point difference in November.MR. SCHULTZ. From a perception point of view, I think we'rea little better off with 4 and 9 percent and tolerating somewhathigher growth than with 5 and 10 percent, tolerating somewhat lower.MR. PARTEE. From the perception of whom? From the financialmarkets or the people who are unemployed?MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I don't want to get into that one! Ihave some rather strong feelings about the fact that the criticalthing we have to do is to find a way to get long-term interest ratesdown. So when we target on that sort of thing, the perception of whatwe do has considerable importance since expectations are so much [afactor] in those long-term rates. But I don't want to get off on adiatribe on that issue.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm a little bothered by the 5 and 10--more by the 10 than the 5--which is above our long-range target and,unlike M1, coming off a high number not a low number.MR. BLACK. True.MS. TEETERS. What do we have for the long-term range?MR. PARTEE. But what is going to bring down M2 growth in theperiod?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I was just going to ask. What, ifanything, is your estimate of M2 based upon here, Mr. Axilrod? Whatis the estimate for December?MR. AXILROD. Well, for December, the M2 growth estimate israther high, given [the data] we now have. In the last week growth ofmoney market funds was a little slower. That's not much to base [yourdecision] upon. But [flows into money funds] have usually sloweddown, with a lag, following a period of declining market rates.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And there is a chance that money marketfunds will really slow down now, because the money market certificaterate is at--and in the next couple of weeks may even be above--themoney market fund rate for the first in a long time.MR. CORRIGAN. That's not going to help M2, though.MR. PARTEE. Won't that shift into another component of M2?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, maybe.-63-12/21-22/81MR. AXILROD. We really have not allowed for the savingsaccounts to show the same kind of strength, so to speak, that they'veshown. If they showed that kind of strength, it would spill over alsointo NOW accounts, I think. We haven't allowed for that continuing.Those are the two principal factors.MR. PARTEE. You have a December estimate of 12.6 percent inthe Bluebook?MR. AXILROD. That's right, and a very marked slowing inJanuary.MR. PARTEE. You have it dropping to 7.3 percent in January.I don't quite see what is going to bring about that slowing from 12 to7 percent, if we don't really care what the figures are.MR. AXILROD. Well, those are the two factors, GovernorPartee. The only thing I could offer is to look at October, which was8 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I didn't realize the December estimate wasquite that high.MR. PARTEE. That's the trouble, you see; that really pinchesit.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Assuming you go ahead with one ormore of these three conceptual changes in the definition of M2, thatwould be effective at the beginning of January or what?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we can make the two we're talkingabout effective right away, I guess, because we have the numbers. Idon't think we have the numbers for--MR. AXILROD. Well, we were assuming that at the beginning ofJanuary we would switch over to M1 as is and do away with M1-A and M1-B. But we had hoped to make the other changes effective in Februarywhen we've [typically] done the seasonals and the benchmarking and doit all at once. Because there are other--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. And making it retroactive?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Can you even do the IRA/Keoghs inFebruary?MR. AXILROD. That I don't know. That depends.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You raised another question, now that Ithink of it.MR. AXILROD. No, I was thinking of the other ones.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have a period here, [November toMarch], which encompasses a period of time when we used M1 shift-adjusted, and there is quite a difference. What are we talking abouthere? A shift-adjusted figure for one month and a---64-12/21-22/81MR. AXILROD. Well, I was assuming you'd start in Januarywith regular M1.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but what is this number we put down--the 4 or 5 percent or whatever?MR. AXILROD. M1.MR. BLACK. It's M1.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For December too?MR. AXILROD. Well, you're comparing it with old M1-B, whichis in effect M1. That's right. M1-B not shift-adjusted is M1.MR. FORD. That's right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the only difference is what mighthappen in December. How much difference is that?MR. AXILROD. Well, there's roughly a 12--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We have to be consistent. If thebase is going to be M1-B unadjusted, then December has to be treatedthat way.MR. AXILROD.MR. SCHULTZ.precision?You take off from the regular M1-B series.Isn't it wonderful to be able to deal in suchMR. BLACK. That's why we all--MR. AXILROD. Well, that number we know. It's the shift-adjusted number that's a little doubtful.MR. PARTEE. Yes, it's really M1 that's 8 percent.MR. AXILROD. That's right.MR. PARTEE. And then it has to drop to 2 percent.MR. AXILROD. Well, it rose from 3 percent to 11 percent inone month.MR. PARTEE. I know.MR. GRAMLEY. As long as we have this around 4 percent, I'd--MR. SCHULTZ. Yes, that may be the more critical point."Around" means anything from 0 to 10.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me take this in an orderly way.The funds rate range is 10 to 14 percent; it was at least among themembers of the Committee. I'm not sure there was any disagreementwith that. That is where we are on the funds rate, I think. Theborrowing really is the only operating decision we're making today. I-65-12/21-22/81gave you a little case for $300 million. The great majority was for$350 to $400 million.MS. TEETERS. I can buy $300 million.MR. RICE. Me too.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If $300 million is going to producewhat Steve thinks it will produce--namely, [a fed funds rate] a shadeover the 12 percent discount rate--then I'd go with that. That'sbasically what I was targeting for when I said $350 million. So itdoesn't bother me if--MR. BOEHNE. That's the way I feel about it too.MR. SCHULTZ. If it doesn't work out that way, we'll kill themessenger! I was going to say put it in--MR. BOEHNE. If it doesn't work out that way, raise theborrowings.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think that's the way it will workout. I wouldn't die if the federal funds rate was 11-7/8 percent oreven 11-3/4 percent. We're at $300 million on the borrowing?MR. WALLICH. Suits me.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All right, Now we'll talk about thecosmetics.MR. SCHULTZ. You're being a little too frank!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The range here is not huge. We can cutthrough it all if you want and say 4-1/2 and 9-1/2 percent.MR. SCHULTZ. Oh, I think that gives a feeling of greaterprecision [than is warranted]; really that's nitpicking it.MR. WALLICH. Well, there were some who wanted to accept anovershoot.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've often used "1/2" and we're--MR. SCHULTZ. I know, but--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Not that often, it seems to me, inthe time I've been on [the Committee]. It certainly makes us look alittle sillier when we miss by a big amount if we put our targets interms of halves.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we have a long record of puttingthem in terms of halves, in my memory, but I--MR. CORRIGAN. And missing them by a large amountMR. SCHULTZ. I'd rather go with either 4 or 5 with someappropriate language than with 4-1/2. I continue to prefer 4 and 9.-66-12/21-22/81MR. PARTEE. How about both: "about 4 to 5 percent" and"about 9 to 10 percent"?MR. AXILROD. I think the Committee once did have [somethinglike] that in the directive, too, for some reason.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't see how we can target over 9percent unless we more or less agree that we are going to raise [thelong-run target for] M2.MR. FORD. That is exactly what was going through my mind.MR. PARTEE. Well, I am going to vote to raise [the targetfor] M2 at the next meeting. We are starting in 1982.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Your mind is supposed to be open for awhile. It is supposed to be open for [unintelligible] too.MR. SCHULTZ. There are some who would feel strongly--MR. CORRIGAN. I like "about 4 and 9."MR. PARTEE. Get it down.MR. SCHULTZ. Me too.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's all right with me. But in any casewe have an understanding that if it goes a little higher than that, wewill not be too bothered.MR. WALLICH. I would prefer 5 and 10 percent with no suchunderstanding, even though it may produce what I don't want--a rise ininterest rates. I think it is just bad in principle that we havefallen into implicitly targeting the funds rate only.MR. PARTEE. That's a very bad principle but I thought we hadgotten away from that.MR. WALLICH. We've done that repeatedly.MR. SCHULTZ. We're going to have to get Henry a red suit anda beard here! I sense a conversion in process here.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. 1982 brings a new Henry Wallich.MR. WALLICH. I'm just being consistent. I didn't want tolet [rates] drop too far; I don't want them to rise too fast.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I agree.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know how to interpret that commentbut.... The only reason I hesitate a little on the 5 and 10 percentis that the 10 looks a little high to me, just visually. I think thatis what we are talking about here.MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, you said it was cosmetic, so 4and 9 percent with the appropriate language would---67-12/21-22/81MR. GRAMLEY. An alternative is 5 and 9 percent with anunderstanding that we may get even more than that.MR. PARTEE. I would be happier with 5 and 9.MS. TEETERS. They're not consistent.SPEAKER(?). We aren't compromising.MR. GRAMLEY. I think Chuck's point is very well taken.We're looking at a growth rate of M1-B shift-adjusted in our thinkingwhereas we are now targeting on non shift-adjusted. The differencewas 3 percentage points. That is quite--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Right at the moment.MR. GRAMLEY. It was 11.1 versus 8.8 percent in the month ofNovember, and that is a huge difference.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, and [consider] the problem we've gotif that reverses itself. We don't know what is going on here.Suppose that suddenly reverses itself in January.We'll just try to arrive at the greatest consensus here. IfI get preferences, I'll know the answer. Who prefers 4 and 9?MS. TEETERS. Wait a minute. What are our chances of hitting9 percent on M2 if we have 5 percent on M1?MR. AXILROD. Well, I think these are very small differences,Governor Teeters, given our track record in predicting theserelationships. I don't think it is a matter of strong significancefor the Committee, actually.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. These differences are small. What we'reassuming is that we're going to continue to have a pretty bigdiscrepancy if we shift adjust it, which we're not going to doanymore. I think what we're saying with the 5 percent is that it[involves] an assumption in substance that there is a lot of NOWaccount [growth] in this.MR. BOEHNE. One possible way to break this is to say:"seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 andM2 in a range of about 4 to 5 percent and 9 to 10 percent." It givesboth numbers and has a range and has "about."MR. CORRIGAN. We still have to draw the path, which makes adifference.MR. BOEHNE. Draw the path somewhere in between [that rangefor M1].MR. PARTEE. Yes, put it at 4-1/2. That is a way of doing4-1/2 percent.MR. BOEHNE. Without being too precise.-68-12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can do that. The only drawback I seeis that in some ways one could argue that it sounds more precise--thatsomehow we're willing to tolerate 4 to 5 percent but we'd get veryupset if it's outside. But I don't know that that's such a big deal.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In New York the market participantsseeing "around 4 to 5 percent" will tend to assume that the "around"refers to the area between 4 and 5 percent. And it gets us a littleless precision if we just say "around 4" or "around 5."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know; that really doesn'tsound too bad to me. But I think a disadvantage of saying "around 4to 5 percent" is--MR. BLACK. Well, M1 for last year is estimated to come outat 4.7 percent, and some little downward movement looks a littlebetter cosmetically. I think the 4 percent is a little better than 5percent and I am forced to settle on it for that reason. But Iwouldn't be disturbed if it hit 5 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, whatever we decide upon, we have tosay here someplace in the directive or elsewhere that we have thisproblem with the fact that we think December is coming in high. Sowhatever number we have here is in a sense not as high for January,February, and March as it appears on the face of it because we thinkwe're operating off a high December number. I think that ought to beclarified somehow in the record. Mr. Axilrod is trying to fiddlearound with this language and it is so obscure that I don't understandwhat it means.MR. SCHULTZ. That is the best kind!VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Would you like to read it?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "Taking account of the significance ofshifts as they may develop between NOW and similar accounts and otherassets..."MR. PARTEE. NOW and similar accounts?MR. BLACK. And other unknown phenomena!MR. BALLES. UFOs!MR. BOEHNE. No, UMOs: unidentified monetary objects!VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's not obscure, that's just--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My quick reaction is that we're not goingto be able to do it in a parenthetic sentence. We've got to writeanother sentence in there after the one that talks about "seeksbehavior" etc. Then we could say: "In reaching this decision theCommittee recognized that the target had to be evaluated in the lightof the fact that shift adjustment was no longer being made and thatthe performance of the aggregates would have to evaluated in the lightof NOW accounts, which have been exceptionally large recently," orsome such thing.-69-12/21-22/81MR. AXILROD. I was trying, Mr. Chairman, to make that applyalso to M2 to allow for savings deposits which have been very strongas well. And we're not predicting any strength here.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's decide upon what we want to sayfirst before we decide upon what, in effect, the footnote says. Howdoes the around 4 to 5 percent and around 9 to 10 percent strike you?MR. SCHULTZ. I'm less happy with it than I am with a precisenumber.MS. TEETERS. You want 4.7 percent?MR. SCHULTZ. No, I want a [single] digit.MR. BALLES. Well, there is virtue in the Chairman'sproposal. We've missed every short-term path this year by aconsiderable margin and I don't know why we should insist on misplacedprecision when we will be lucky to come even close to the intermeetingpath, if the past record is any indication.MR. SCHULTZ. The problem with it is that I think Tony isright. The Fed watchers will misinterpret if given any opportunity todo so. And I think it gives them a greater opportunity tomisinterpret if we say "around 4 to 5 percent" in that they will infact look at that as a range in which we're trying to operate, with adegree of precision that we don't have.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's what I thought in a way, too.But when I think about it more, I am not sure what your objection isto "around 4 to 5." Is it in substance that it is too high?MR. SCHULTZ. No, my objection to it is that I prefer 4 and 9percent and a willingness to tolerate somewhat higher growth. It iseasier to draw the path and I just think it works better than your--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, clearly, we'd draw the path at 4-1/2percent if we had "around 4 to 5 percent" initially.MR. SCHULTZ. I still prefer 4 and 9.MR. PARTEE. This would be published when, Murray, February5th?MR. ALTMANN. February 5th.MR. PARTEE. And when do you [testify], do you know?MS. TEETERS. Probably February 20th with Proxmire.MR. CORRIGAN. I have a preference for 4 and 9 percent, butnot on the cosmetics. It is a small distinction but I still think theeconomy will turn around, and I would like to have the leeway down theroad rather than now. But the initial borrowing of $300 million isfine with me.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, how do we reconcile this smalldifference? After listening to all of this, how many still prefer 4-70-12/21-22/81and 9? How many prefer around 4 to 5 and around 9 to 10? We haven'tseen all the hands up.MR. PARTEE. You haven't asked about who would prefer 5 and10.MR. ROOS. You wanted just voting members?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, just voting members at this point.That leaves two with a preference for 5 to 10, I assume.MR. RICE. I have a preference. I didn't know how you weregoing--MR. PARTEE. And I thought you were going to say "prefer" and"live with."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, all right. [Our preferences] arealmost symmetrical. It sounds to me as if everybody ought to be ableto live with the "around 4 to 5."MS. TEETERS. And the 9 to 10?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And 9 to 10.MR. WALLICH. It is the principle of it that bothers me.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What is the principle?MR. WALLICH. That we're now beginning to fudge thedifference between 4 and 5 by saying "around." The next time it willbe around 4 to 6 and then around 4 to 7.MR. FORD. Suddenly, it becomes our long-term forecast.MR. WALLICH. It becomes increasingly realistic.MR. BLACK. I think Henry has detected a trend.MR. ROOS. Anything that is a departure from customaryterminology leads market people to read things into it, I think.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Have we ever given a range before?MR. AXILROD. I know we did once before.MR. PARTEE. Yes, I am pretty sure we did.MR. AXILROD. I am not sure if it was for both M1 and M2. Itcertainly was on M1.MR. CORRIGAN. In this particular case we can probably getaway with it a little more easily simply because of this problem ofgoing from shift-adjusted to non shift-adjusted. I hadn't thought ofthat. That really does make a difference in terms of our transition.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I just expressed my preference, but I'mnot going to fall on my sword about this.-71-12/21-22/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How many can live with the 4 to 5 and 9 to10 [formulation]?MS. TEETERS. Do you want a show of hands?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Again, I just want to say that if wedo 9 to 10 percent, then that does imply very strongly a case--and Ithink the markets will definitely read it that way--that we're goingto come out in February with a revised figure that is somewhat higherthan 9 percent on M2.MR. GRAMLEY. I don't think that interpretation is necessaryany more than it meant we were going to revise the targets on M1-Bwhen we put a number like 7 percent for M1-B shift-adjusted during thesummer or early fall.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. When I say this, somehow we are going toget in here that we think the December number is going to be higherthan either of these numbers.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We don't want to say thatspecifically. Suppose we're wrong?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we can be wrong. Well, wecould be wrong, but it would take a very sharp drop in both of them tocome in below 4 to 5 percent on M1. It's now estimated at 8.8percent, I think.MR. AXILROD. Yes. The policy record in that light, Mr.Chairman, with regard to M2--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Anything is possible. I wouldn't promiseyou that it couldn't come in within that range but it would take avery sharp drop in the last two weeks of December.MR. AXILROD. With regard to M2--and also M1, moretentatively--the policy record [for the November meeting] clearlyindicates that the Committee expected a slower growth rate in thecourse of the quarter. That is, the 9 to 10 is really consistent--itwouldn't be that specific with something like 7 to 8 percent [forM1-B].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This figure is between alternatives A andB; what does that imply for quarterly growth rates?MR. AXILROD. For M1 it would be somewhere between 4-1/2 and5-3/4 percent on a quarterly average basis, and for M2 somewherebetween 9-3/4 and 10-1/2 percent. They are fairly high.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just taking the midpoint, the growth ratesare a little over 5 percent and around 10 percent on a quarterlyaverage basis, which is the nearest thing to a long-term target.Whatever we put down will be high in relation to the long-term targetsinterpreted on a quarter-to-quarter basis.MR. AXILROD. Yes, the monthly growth rates are slow.-72-12/21-22/81MR. BOYKIN. [If we say] 4 to 5 percent and 9 to 10 percent,I have a little problem with the understanding that we are not goingto be that concerned if it comes out higher. That is a bit of adifficult bridge for me to get across because I would find acceptablethe 4 and 9 percent with the understanding that you talked aboutearlier but I am a little uncomfortable with it. So, to go to 4 to 5and 9 to 10 makes me even more uncomfortable.MR. GUFFEY. Just to follow on that, Bob, I would prefer thatthe Desk, without regard to how it comes out in the directive, starttargeting with 4 percent rather than 4 to 5 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You know, we are now talking about verysmall differences here. I am inclined to think that we are best offwith the 4 to 5 and 9 to 10 [formulation]. Whether we set that pathat 4 or 4-1/2 percent is going to make what--a $50 million differenceby 3 or 4 weeks from now?MR. AXILROD. Something like that. [No], by March it is thatbig, so it is less [for the next few weeks].VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My concern is not with the substance.We all know the difference is very small. My concern is that I thinkwe are loosing a certain sense of respect because of how outsidepeople see these things. They see an overrun in M2. They see ustargeting 9 to 10 percent, which is over our preliminary M2 target.It seems to me that there will be an immediate feeling in the market--I don't see how we could avoid that--that we probably will move the M2target up in February and there will be talk about some easing. If weare willing to do that, all right; but I don't see how we can avoidthat impression. If we had had a shortfall in M2, sure, we could getaway with 9 to 10 percent. I don't see how we can escape that marketreaction; if that market reaction doesn't bother you, all right, but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But there will be an explanation in therethat we were high in December, which encompasses this period.MR. GRAMLEY. Well, we could say that the growth ratesimplied for January and February, given the present estimates, wouldbe below 9 percent. I really think we can handle that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we can find a handle on that, too,Lyle.MR. BALLES. Tony, the present directive calls for M2 at anannual rate of around 11 percent. So what is different about this?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You are talking about the short term.MR. BALLES. Yes.MR. PARTEE. Well, we are talking about the short term here.The M2 growth rate was 16 percent for the month of November. And howare we going to bring it down?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's go ahead with the 4 to 5 and 9to 10 and see what comes up. Before we vote, there is this question[of the precise language to use]. I am afraid we are not going to be-73-12/21-22/81able to draft this very well sitting here. I may exceed the limits ofyour confidence and trust, but if you would delegate to me inconsultation with the staff the task of putting another sentence inthe directive, I would be pleased to undertake that responsibility.It would say we are moving from a shift-adjusted number to a nonshift-adjusted number and M1 growth running a little high in Decemberbecause of this NOW account bulge. We would get a little flavor ofthat in another sentence in the directive.MR. SCHULTZ. I have great confidence that between you andMr. Axilrod you can make it properly obscure!MR. BOEHNE. I second that vote of confidence.MR. GRAMLEY. You are full of Christmas spirit!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the alternative is putting it inthe policy record, which the staff will do anyway in other language.This would be in the directive. Is that agreeable? With thatunderstanding, let us vote.MR. ALTMANN.Chairman Volcker YesVice Chairman Solomon NoPresident Boehne YesPresident Boykin NoPresident Corrigan YesGovernor Gramley YesPresident Keehn YesGovernor Partee YesGovernor Rice YesGovernor Schultz YesGovernor Teeters YesGovernor Wallich YesCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay.MR. BALLES. Now that this has been decided, I wonder if Ican return for just a second to your comments a while ago that I foundvery interesting, to put it mildly, that once we had decided that theonly real operational decision this time was the borrowing assumption,we could now deal with the cosmetics. That brings to my mind thequestion: Why don't we in the Bluebook, Steve, have some moreanalysis on this borrowing assumption that goes with the variousalternatives and its implications? This is a very key part of what wedecide at a meeting. And I, for one, would like to see some text,analysis, and recommendations. Is there some reason that it is notdesirable or what?MR. AXILROD. Well, we could certainly expand on it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just interpret my comment. I donot interpret my comment as meaning at all that these aggregatefigures are not important. The problem I talked about is that withina 1-month perspective what we do operationally to affect our reachingthose targets is to set the path. It doesn't mean that these othernumbers are not very important in a longer-term perspective. But theconnection in any 1-month or 6-week period between meetings is very-74-12/21-22/81loose. It does in an operational sense come down to setting thatreserve path--to state it more accurately--rather than the borrowingassumption. The borrowing assumption is part of it. It does not meanthat we are operating on the basis of ignoring these numbers. But thenumbers are cosmetic. They are not cosmetic at all in a longerperspective. I just want that clarification in the record.MR. BALLES. Even if you had not made that comment, I wasstill going to bring this point up. There is a hidden variablerunning around loose here on these borrowing assumptions.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, the point is still--MR. BALLES. And I would very strongly urge that we getsomething on it in the text in the Bluebook, unless I am missing somereason why they don't do it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it is in the Bluebook, isn't it? Ithought you were raising a question of whether it should be in thedirective.MR. AXILROD. Maybe I could explain, President Balles. Wecould develop it further, of course. But one of the things that cameout of that study we did last year was that in terms of analysis andachievement of targets, the best kind of borrowing assumption toassume at the beginning of our path is the borrowing assumption thatseemed to be consistent with the interest rates that come out of themoney supply target. So, generally what we try to put down is whatthe Committee in reaching its decision may wish to use as an initialborrowing figure. Heaven alone knows what the final borrowing will bebecause that depends on how the money supply actually behaves.Presumably what the Committee makes its decision on, in some sense, isfirst whether it believes those relationships, and second, how itmight wish to tilt, if it wishes to tilt, the initial starting point.But after the initial starting point, this borrowing is pretty welldominated by what happens to the money supply.MR. WALLICH. But the borrowing assumption is generallyviewed by people who look at these things at all as a proxy for thefunds rate. So, if we put this into the directive, it will beinterpreted as having taken a step in the direction of at leastinitially targeting on the funds rate. Now, it is true that borrowingshifts thereafter; but quite often we take steps to prevent that, likeforgiving low volumes of borrowing or redistributing borrowing over aperiod of weeks. These are all ways of focusing more fully on thefunds rate than a pure money supply target.MR. BALLES. Henry, I was never suggesting that we ought toput the borrowing assumption in the published directive as part of thespecifications. I was urging that there be more analysis and sets ofassumptions about different borrowing levels as part of [the Bluebook]for the benefit of the decisionmakers.MR. WALLICH. Well, that would reassure me. The second thingthat would reassure me is if we left the borrowing more fully to findits own level during the period.MR. PARTEE. We have to start someplace, though, Henry.-75-12/21-22/81MR. WALLICH. Oh yes, we need a starting point.MR. PARTEE. That is all we are talking about.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I understand what you are saying--Idon't know what you have in mind in substance--in principle I thinkwhat you are saying is fine. Whatever analysis we need we should havein there. Maybe you should talk to Steve a bit more concretely aboutwhat you might have in mind. I thought he did put in what he thoughtwas consistent with these numbers. The Committee has modified it alittle today and on other days, on the basis of where we wanted totake the risk, so to speak. But why don't you talk to Steve aboutputting something in.The Secretary raises the question of whether we are going tohave a Monday afternoon session at the next meeting. Normally wewould in the light of the fact that we have to settle on the long-range targets. So, I think you ought to assume that.MR. PARTEE. There will be a longer projection [horizon],too, won't there? You will have to give us some look at 1983?MR. AXILROD. We also plan to have alternative strategies, ifthe Committee wishes, as we have put it at other times, onimplications for phasing down or staying the same.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The other item that we have is the releaseof the memoranda of discussion for early '76. Maybe you ought todescribe this situation, Mr. Altmann.MR. ALTMANN. Well, as we said in the memo to you, thesememoranda for the first three meetings of 1976 are described asunofficial because they have never been presented to the Committee forreview or acceptance as we did in the old days. We were under a courtorder to accede to requests for the segregable factual portions of thememoranda and the Committee made the decision in May of 1976 todiscontinue the memoranda of discussion after the memorandum forMarch. Those three memoranda were not presented because the draftingof them was given a low priority and they were not completed untilsome years later and by then the composition of the Committee hadchanged. That is essentially the issue. They could be withheld asbeing unofficial documents. They could be withheld, I suppose, evenif they were regarded as official memoranda.There is one other issue that I brought to the attention ofthe Chairman because I thought he should be aware of it before we putthese out. At both the February and March meetings there was anexecutive session which concerned the Merrill case--that is, the suitunder the Freedom of Information Act. And at the February meetingthere was a report by the General Counsel on the oral decision thathad been handed down by the District Court at that time, which wasagainst the Committee, on release of the directive immediately and onrelease of the segregable facts in the memoranda of discussion. Atthe February meeting the Committee agreed to the appointment of asubcommittee to consider what to do with the memoranda of discussionin light of this court decision, which was obviously troublesome inmany ways. At the March meeting, which was after the written decisionof the court, the General Counsel again reviewed the options and the-76-12/21-22/81Committee agreed to appeal the decision on the directive, but not onthe memoranda of discussion. As you all probably know, that case wentto the Supreme Court and back to the District Court, and the DistrictCourt ruled in June of this year that the Committee or the Board didnot have to release the directive immediately. That was not appealed,so that is a dead issue at this point. But this would probably be thefirst time that the System has acknowledged the link between theMerrill case and the discontinuance of the memoranda of discussion. Ithink everyone connected with the case assumed that was the fact. Andin testimony before Congressional committees starting in 1977 withChairman Burns on new legislation to require some detailed minutes, itwas said that the Board would go along with that legislation providedthere was an explicit relief from the requirements of the Freedom ofInformation Act. Later testimony of Governor Coldwell and then ViceChairman Schultz made the same points. I think it was generallyassumed that there was a link between the Merrill case and thediscontinuation.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You said something that confused me a bit,if I understood you. I thought we were releasing these minutes in thepast as entirely a voluntary act.MR. ALTMANN. Well, it began as a voluntary act and continuedto be so in the sense that the court order only required that weprovide the segregable portions of the memoranda that were factual.We would have had to provide that on request. But we continued topublish the entire memoranda with only those deletions made inaccordance with our guidelines.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but on this segregable facts issue,there was a case about that. The only reason we haven't released thesegregable facts is that nobody has asked?MR. ALTMANN. I think that is the case. Mr. Mannion may haveanother--MR. PARTEE. Did you ever see that draft with the segregablefacts?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I remember that discussion, but Ithought the whole thing was dropped.MS. TEETERS. But we have only released these with a 5-yeardelay, is that correct?MR. ALTMANN. That is correct. I should have stated at theoutset that in releasing these memoranda for early 1976 we would befollowing the schedule that we had followed for a number of years.The only thing about them that is different is that they are"unofficial."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I thought the only issue here wasbasically that we are releasing them now, though it is questionablewhether we have to. But if we release them now, we have continued thepractice we had in the past. Nobody can raise any question of ourholding back something that we have. On the other hand, if we releasethem, it calls attention to the fact that we no longer [prepare] these-77-12/21-22/81documents. And it may engender some discussion instead of letting thesleeping dogs lie. What do you have to say?MR. MANNION. Everyone realizes that we don't prepare thememoranda of discussion any longer. If you are ever challenged, youalways would have to release segregable facts; those are not subjectto any privilege under the Freedom of Information Act. What theCommittee has been doing on this 5-year delay basis is releasing theentire memorandum of discussion for each meeting except for certainitems that may relate to a foreign country or central bank or someconcern of the Treasury Department.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And that has been entirely voluntary?MR. MANNION. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The question before us is: Do we persistin our entirely voluntary policy, recognizing these three haven't beenchecked the way the others have been checked by individual members ofthe Committee? And we will just say that these three months are allwe have. Or do we forget about it on the basis that nobody has askedand who cares? I don't have a strong feeling one way or the other,but I don't think this will attract much attention. Is Mr. Coynehere? We put these out without an announcement as I recall.MR. ALTMANN. We have not put out an--MR. COYNE. I think they will go completely unnoticed. Iwould bet that you would not get one request.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Hoping that Mr. Coyne is correct, I haveno trouble myself in putting these out with a notice that they haven'tbeen checked the way the others have but this completes [the releaseof] what we have and is in accordance with [past practice].MR. COYNE. Even when we have announced--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is this discussion of the Merrillcase in them, but that doesn't bother me much.MR. BALLES. Can you possibly remember what you said back in1976? I couldn't.MR. MORRIS. I am the only one here who was at those meetingsand I couldn't.MR. FORD. Nobody can spot something he wishes he never said?MR. MORRIS. That is a long time to remember what we said.MR. PARTEE. Well, I was there, too, and--MR. GRAMLEY. It is better not to start down that routebecause if we do, then we do have to stamp them as official.SPEAKER(?). Yes.-78-12/21-22/81MR. GRAMLEY. Put them out now and if [no member of theCommittee] has looked at them, they are purely staff documents. Ithink we are safer that way than to start trying to hunt down thosepeople who might remember.MR. ALTMANN. We have a prefatory note which states thesituation in terms of their being called "unofficial" because theywere prepared after a time lag and had not gone through the [usualreview] procedure.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if there is no objection or nocontrary concern, we will just put them out as quietly as possible,which has been the case.MR. ALTMANN. We don't issue a press release on this.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. While we are making them available, we arenot announcing that they are available, if I understand thiscorrectly. That means if somebody asks, he gets it. If nobody asks,I guess nothing will ever happen. With that understanding we shallproceed. I believe that is all the business we have. Do we havelunch out there?MR. ALTMANN. Yes, lunch is available in the anteroom forGovernors and Presidents and those who have been invited to stay.END OF MEETING-79-
