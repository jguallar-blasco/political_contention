Further, there is no transcript record of the beginningof this call.]MR. ANGELL. [Should we retain] the $600 million [borrowingassumption] for the two-week period until the next FOMC meeting, orwould we want some leeway here for a somewhat lower possibility, giventhe day-to-day watch?CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think we're playing it on a day-to-daybasis. And in a crisis environment, I suspect we shouldn't reallyfocus on longer-term policy questions until we get beyond thisimmediate period of chaos.MR. ANGELL. But I presume that there's at least anacceptance by the members of the Committee that the $600 million onborrowings is not necessarily in place in the coming two weeks as wellas in the reserve maintenance period now ending.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. Does anybody disagree withGovernor Angell's comment on this?MR. STERNLIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to think that there'sa particular element of flexibility here because I suspect there maybe some greater reluctance by banks to borrow in this kind of--MR. JOHNSON. I agree with Peter on that. I think that oneof the problems we may run into, and we've already seen it, is astrong unwillingness to borrow. And trying to force the borrowingtarget in that environment could result in an unbelievable funds rate.So, I agree with Peter; he needs the flexibility, at least for awhile, to manage that situation. We just don't know what we're upagainst, at least for a while, in this kind of situation.MR. HELLER. I agree with what both Governors Angell andJohnson have said and I think we also need to watch the fed funds ratein that environment. As long as we are where we are, I think we arein good shape; given the fact that Treasury bill rates have dropped somuch, we really have some room in that arena. So, I'm agreeing withour press statement this morning: That's what we said we would wantto do, so let's do it.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I want to ask Sam Cross if he willexplain to us why the dollar is as strong as it is in thisenvironment.MR. CROSS. That's a very good question and I wish I had agood answer for it. We've been asking ourselves and others that,without any really very convincing response. Certainly, there hasbeen some liquidating of things abroad as people have brought fundsback into the United States either for meeting their own liquidityneeds or for other purposes. Also, with all the world tending to beunder the same, or at least a downward, pressure in fairly substantial10/20/87under the same, or at least a downward, pressure in fairly substantialamount, that may be having an influence. Another factor in the past24 hours is that the climate has looked much better for thecooperative activities among us, the Germans, and the Japanese.That's reflected in the statements that followed Secretary Baker'smeeting with Mr. Soltenberg, and the Japanese comments this morningadd to that. Also, the statement of the Federal Reserve this morningwas favorably noted. I'm not sure that adds up to a very convincinganswer.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. In part, I think, the issue obviously isthat potentially defaulting investors in dollar securities weredrawing funds out of other currencies. That presupposes that thedeclines in the other markets were not doing the reverse, which Iassume is where you come out.MR. CROSS. Yes. Perhaps reflecting what Peter is talkingabout, in our bond market there has been some tendency to move intoTreasury bonds as kind of an attractive place at this point, given thechaos in so many of the equity markets around the world. But I thinkthere certainly has been liquidation of overseas positions. And we'veheard reports, certainly from our colleagues in Canada and from one ortwo other places, that they have seen investment firms and othersliquidating positions, for example in Canadian dollars, and bringingthem back.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, Jerry Corrigan here.Can I just make two quick comments? [Unintelligible] you may havecovered this before I came in the room, but I would want to say thatjust because we have not seen hard evidence of any sizable ortroubling losses, obviously that doesn't mean that they may not bethere. It's quite clear that a lot of people are not entirely surewhere they are. It's also worth keeping in mind the margin calls forthe funds. The New York Stock Exchange for the big clients may startto [unintelligible]. I'm not sure what was being said before aboutmonetary policy over the near term, but the second point I would makeis that certainly, we've got to have maximum flexibility, at least forthe days ahead. But I'm not willing to prejudge at all the questionof where borrowing should or should not be in a more permanent fashionat this point.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I sense that that is the consensus as agroup.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I'm not so sure of that.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think we stated it that way, and sinceI got very little response, I assume that was acquiescence.MR. JOHNSON. I agree with what Jerry said. When you reallydon't know where you're going to be, you might as well assume the samesituation until you reassess at some point. I think that's where weare.CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any other issues before the group thisafternoon? Gentlemen, I think it would be useful to do more of these[conference calls] rather than less during this period to make certainthat we're all feeding whatever information and insights we have into10/20/87the system. So, if you don't mind, I'd like to schedule another oneof these for tomorrow at some point, hopefully after the close, ifthat's adequate or appropriate for everybody.END OF SESSION
