Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 2.
 Péhl (168 - 238)  Mr. Chairman, before we talk about paragraphs shouldn't we try to get a little more clarity into what we are really going to suggest to our principles. What will we suggest. Will we suggest, as Jacques has proposed, to start negotiations on a legal text immediately on the basis of our Report. That is one alternative, or are we of the opinion as a group that that would be premature, that we should leave that - as Robin has suggested in his proposal - to the development, that we should aim first for more progress and convergence in the real economy and then in due time, when the time is ripe or right, we start this process of negotiation, the legal thing. These are the two extremes I would say. Firstly, let me _ say, Mr. Chairman, I am very glad that after the very natural struggles which we have had, we reached a text yesterday and in our last meeting which I think is very very co-operative. I read it, as you all did, and I think it is a good text now apart from some little drafting points (what we concluded yesterday). It would be very desirable after having reached such a high degree of agreement in very substantial points, if we could come out of this room today, if possible, also with an agreed text. I really think we should aim for some compromise between these two extreme positions. Of course, if we can't we always have the possibility of telling the world that we disagree on the follow-up and further procedures and that we describe two alternatives, but that would be the second-best solution. The best solution would be, of course, a compromise and I wonder whether the compromise could be a little bit on the lines suggested by Wim — but maybe we could redraft that. The compromise in substance could be that we Say we Suggest that preparatory work for a legal Treaty should be started immediately - coming a little bit in the way of Jacques - and in the competent bodies of the Community. I think that is going to happen anyway  because the Monetary Committee and ECOFIN will all read the text and work  on that and if we suggest that they should continue and that, for instance, there should be a working party of the Committee of Governors to deal with details of this Report, etc., and the same in the Monetary Committee, I think that would be appropriate. We can't say nothing should happen, here is our Report and that is it, the rest we leave to you. That would not be good, anyway, because then we would give the whole thing to the politicians and we would lose all control of this process. Then we say after this preparatory work - and we leave it open when that would be - if the first stage has been implemented, which will also take time, of course, and this preparatory work will take a long time I am afraid, and then at one point there should be negotiations. That would be a kind of compromise. I don't know whether that is sufficient for both parties, but that is what I would  suggest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker presents two alternative options for how negotiations should proceed on the basis of their report. One option is to start negotiations immediately, as proposed by Jacques. The other option is to first focus on progress and convergence in the real economy before starting negotiations, as suggested by Robin. The speaker expresses their preference for a compromise between these two extremes, but acknowledges that if no compromise can be reached, the group may have to acknowledge their disagreement and propose both alternatives.


Passage number 3.
  The Chairman (238 - 257)  I repeat that my proposal is a proposal of method only, to concentrate this point on the follow-up procedure and not to discuss’ the same subject three times. It is not my job to take a position on the substance, my duty is to reach a global consensus within the Committee, but if we discuss this point now, the problem remains that to concentrate our proposal at the end of the Report because it is better for the clarity of the Report and to accept the Mr. Duisenberg's amendment for para. 41. It is a question of method and not a question of substance. Do we discuss method or substance. Pres. Pohl has proposed a compromise which we can discuss  immediately, but we are not discussing this again at the end of the Report.  M. A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not have any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker is stating their proposal and clarifying that their focus is on the method, not the substance, of the discussion. They also mention a compromise proposed by Pres. Pohl that can be discussed immediately.


Passage number 4.
 Lamfalussy (257 - 263) On your question, Mr. Chairman, does your suggestion concerning  the method imply that whatever we decide on the time proposal for the  ‘Treaty discussion goes at the end, or when we come to the end can we still  put it back into para. 41.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and asking for further information or confirmation regarding the suggested method.


Passage number 5.
  The Chairman (263 - 265)  For para. 41 I propose the Mr. Duisenberg's amendment. Mr. F. Andriessen . (267 - 273)   I have an important point just for clarification. The text within brackets is not completely covered by the procedural proposals. "The first part is a firm political commitment to the creation of economic and monetary union, as described in Part II, would appear to be an indispensable precondition for lending credibility to the decision to  embark on the first stage". That sentence we should retain anyhow.  Mr. N.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing an important point for clarification.


Passage number 6.
 Thygesen (275 - 285)  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the effort to concentrate the discussion as much as possible and not to have it several times, but I do think we need to address the substantive issues, otherwise if we postpone this essential question including the para. that has now been left out of para. 41, we risk leaving that to so late in the day that we won't have a proper discussion of it. I regard, like Gov. de Larosiére, that the 2nd part of para. 41 is essential to the whole Report. You identified yesterday four or five issues in Part III that you thought were important, I think that we ought to go through that as an agenda and also the content of the  stages, I think we need to get to that as soon as possible.  M. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply expresses their opinion and suggests addressing certain issues in a timely manner.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 7.
 de Larosiére (286 - 347)  May I say something to answer what Karl-Otto said a moment ago. I do not accept being positioned in an extremist position here and I will explain why. Indeed, I do consider that the time has now come to start the process of negotiating a Treaty and that part, of course, will comprise a preparatory sub-part, but that is not an extreme position. We have been asked to deliver, to provide, to the Heads of State concrete stages or steps for the creation of an economic and monetary union. The first stage that we have put forward is a soft stage and that was not my view, as you know. I thought we had to embark on something more significant at the very beginning. I am making compromises all day and we do this for the soft stage. But I insist very much, and if I am the only one to say this then I will be happy to say it alone, that since we are going the soft first stage way and not doing something that could have been done - pooling of reserves and very concrete manifestations of our interest in this endeavour - it is very important and essential to me, and I think to others here, to show  that something is happening, that there is an impulse, some dynamism that  has been put in the whole process. This impulse can only come from the launching of a process that is going to change in the future the institutional structure of all this - if we agree, of course, to do this. It is vital for me, and it is not the manifestation of an extreme position, that the softness of the first stage be in a way offset by the indication that now is the time to launch a process of negotiation. I would accept that that process of negotiation will take time, Karl-Otto, I can accept that it has to be prepared on a technical level, but the launching of the process is something that is very important. We had a long discussion last time on the importance of a signal and Alexandre made proposals on that; I thought we had agreed on the basic idea. My difficulty is not, Mr. Chairman, to concentrate the discussion on the timing of this launching of the negotiations, etc. at the end, and you know I am a very easy person to deal with, if you want to do it at the end I will be absolutely happy, but with respect to Wim there is something other than procedure in the 2nd sub-para of para. 41 and that something else is for me very important. It is the notion that if you want to lend credibility to this extremely soft first stage - let us be honest amongst ourselves, there is nothing really important in that first stage - we must indicate that some firm commitment for the creation of the whole process has to be given and that Signal I  think is, indeed, very important. That is my view.  Dott. C.A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker disagrees with Karl-Otto's previous statement and asserts their own position on the need for negotiations and a signaling of commitment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 8.
 Ciampi (347 - 362)  I have one point of method and one of substance. The point of method is that I cannot accept postponing this part, but if we discuss the final part together otherwise it would be unacceptable. Second point: I share many of the views expressed by Gov. de Larosiére that we have to give strength to our Report as far as this important part is concerned, putting in something which is a message, to give some specific commitment. Of course, it is not a matter of time because it takes time but we have to  stress 1t in a very clear way.  M. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "I cannot accept postponing this part" indicates a disagreement with someone who wants to postpone the discussion. Additionally, the phrase "I share many of the views expressed by Gov. de Larosiére" suggests that there may be differing views on this topic.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 9.
 Godeaux (362 - 387)  Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that as a matter of procedure I accept your suggestion, which is in effect that there is only one part of the Report in which we discuss this important matter. As regards the  substance, the heart of the matter, I would like to say this: as Gov.  de Larosiére has said, as Mr. Andriessen has said, there is more than simply procedure, there is the message that has to be given. I believe personally that we have to suggest to our Heads of State and Government that a significant and visible signal of a political nature has to be given. Therefore, I should like to say that basically I am in agreement with what Jacques de Larosiére and Gov. Ciampi have said as regards the heart of the matter: a clearly visible and significant political signal must be given in order to give credibility to what we say, otherwise it will be perceived by public opinion - I know it will be perceived by our own politicians in our own countries - that we Governors have simply succeeded in telling the world that we shall continue doing what we have done so far which is - and what is true ~ co-operating in a very effective and pleasant manner. But we have to say more than that. That is my  position.  Mr. M.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that they agree with what Jacques de Larosiere and Gov. Ciampi have said as regards the heart of the matter, implying that there are others who do not agree with this stance. The speaker also mentions that if a political signal is not given, it will be perceived by public opinion that the Governors have simply continued doing what they have done so far, suggesting that there may be differing opinions on whether a political signal should be given.


Passage number 10.
 Rubio (388 - 407)  Mr. Chairman, I think that this proposal ... now on this para. is the most important part of this Report and I think the best thing is to discuss it now, maybe with the last para. on the question of method, but not to leave the discussion to the end, because it all depends on what we say at this point, the rest is not very important. On the question of method, I think we should tackle the most important question at the beginning because it all depends on that. On the question of substance, I think that is very important and I completely agree with M. Godeaux that if we don't say that we are saying nothing really. I think it is very important if we are able to arrive at unanimity, but maybe that is impossible in which case .we would have to state clearly the different opinions on this point, because I think this is the most important point in the Report. I am not sure that we cannot compromise but I do not think we  should arrive at a compromise which is meaningless.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and making suggestions for the discussion of the proposal, but there is no disagreement or conflict with others.


Passage number 11.
  The Chairman (407 - 423)  Can I distinguish the following procedure on one part, and I understand that all the members agree to discuss, for example, the proposal of Pres. Pohl, the amendment of Mr. Ciampi, de Larosiére, Leigh-Pemberton, in the "Suggested follow-up procedure" and can we concentrate our minds on  the 2nd sub~para. of para. 41, because this is the first difficult point, because many members express, clearly Mr. de Larosiére, that in the same time of the stage one there is a necessity to have a clear political signal and this 1s the draft of the 2nd sub-para. Can we concentrate our minds on  the 2nd sub-para., please.  Mr. W.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not discussing a particular issue, proposal, or argument. It is simply asking for the members to focus their attention on a specific part of a document or discussion.


Passage number 12.
 Duisenberg (423 - 435)  Mr. Chairman, with the statement as contained in that 2nd para. between square brackets I have no serious quarrel, because it is still a general statement. ("A firm political commitment ...") (POhl: "The implementation of the concrete measures proposed for a stage one should be  supported ...'') I have made the brackets myself, you see....
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 13.
  The Chairman (435 - 439)  Please, can we concentrate on the 2nd sub-para., because for the last sentence of the first sub-para. we have a proposal of Mr. Duisenberg to treat this point at the end of the Report. There remains the problem of  the 2nd sub-para.  Mr. W.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking to focus on the second sub-paragraph and addressing a proposal made by Mr. Duisenberg.


Passage number 14.
 Duisenberg (439 - 455)  I have no serious quarrel with the 2nd para. as it is worded, but we know perfectly well of each other what our positions are. There are two types of amendments to this 2nd para., one type is suggested on the right page by Gov. Leigh-Pemberton, Hoffmeyer and Doyle, which also goes on the procedure, which will push the political commitment of entering into Treaty negotiations further in the future. Then there is the amendment suggested by Gov. de Larosiére which will bring it forward to enter immediately into negotiations. In between those I have suggested my follow-up procedure as contained in paras. 66 and 69, that is the significance as a compromise formula between those diverging views. That is all I have intended to do  here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that they have no serious quarrel with the second paragraph and simply explains the different types of amendments suggested by others. They also mention their own suggested compromise as a way to bridge diverging views.


Passage number 15.
  The Chairman (455 - 459) But you have no objection to maintaining the 2nd _ sub-para.  (Duisenberg: No objection, if it is maintained as it is.)  Herrn K.O.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: Both speakers agree that there is no objection to maintaining the 2nd sub-paragraph, as long as it remains unchanged.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 16.
 Pohl (459 - 534)  I'm sorry, I am not sure that I fully understood what you said, but I have strong objections to accepting this wording, this language, because, Mr. Chairman, it has been said again and again that the Heads of State and Government, and even we, are asked to give a signal, I am not sure whether that is really appropriate or reasonable. What does it mean to give a signal. To what. If we ask too much from the Governments and Parliaments in Europe, there is a very great risk that this Report will have the same fate as the Werner Report, because then the failure of the whole thing is already embedded, if we ask too much. We are all aware what the positions of the Governments are in Europe. We need unanimous support in the Council for a new Treaty, to start a Treaty, as long as it is in the framework of the EEC. So all Heads of State and Government have to agree and if we ask too much I think it is very clear that there will be no agreement and then the whole thing will be finished for the time being, and we will not even enter into stage one, because it is said that a clear commitment to start negotiations immediately on a new Treaty is a precondition for stage one as well. I am not sure whether that is really a very wise position.  On the other hand, I think the language of the first para. of para. 41 is something that all of us can subscribe to, that we say: "the Committee agreed that the creation of economic and monetary union must be viewed as a single process. Although set out in Stages which guide the progressive movement to the final objective, the decision to enter the first stage should be a decision to embark on the entire process". That is a very far-reaching statement and I haven't heard any objections to that yet. The next sentence I would strongly urge you to delete because we cannot say the implementation of the concrete measures proposed for stage one should be supported by the conclusion of a new Treaty. Who knows what is going to happen. Of course, if we finish stage one we will go to stage two and that implies a Treaty, but I don't think that this is a very reasonable sentence. The 2nd part of the para. I think goes much too far: "indispensable preconditions". I mean "a firm political commitment to the creation of economic and monetary union would appear to be an indispensable precondition for lending credibility". In substance it is correct, but it the expression is so dramatic and in my view this is not really the main  problem. I think that Robin's text is much better and fits much better into  reality. It says the most important precondition for reaching stage two is that we finalise stage one, and stage one means that all member states participate, that we have a higher degree of convergence. How can we talk about the Treaty, about the monetary union and the European Central Bank as long as almost half of the membership of the EC is either not willing or not able to participate in the existing institutional system. The EMS: almost half of the membership, including Italy which has now for 10 years relied on a broader margin for reasons we all know, that means that 5 countries, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and the UK do not participate in the EMS and as long as this is the case it makes no sense at all to talk about a monetary union, at least not a European monetary union. Then it may be a monetary union between France and Germany, including Holland, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland, but this is not a European monetary union. I think Robin's language is much better, much more realistic. Maybe with the exception of the last sentence where he is a little vague and which maybe could be strengthened. It has much more to do with reality than this strong  call for negotiations on a monetary union.  The Rt. Hon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses strong objections and disagrees with the wording, language, and approach being discussed. They argue that asking too much from governments and parliaments in Europe could lead to failure and a lack of agreement. They also disagree with the proposed preconditions and language regarding the creation of economic and monetary union.


Passage number 18.
 Rubio (628 - 672)   Very briefly. I completely understand the remarks about the actual situation of the EMS and the fact that many countries are not members of the ERM, but I insist on a certain point because I think it is very important for this membership what happens in this Report and what happens in future decisions. I think I can say here in confidence that the decision of the Spanish Government will depend on the result of the discussion we are having now and maybe the Spanish Government is prepared to take a very clear decision. It will depend on the kind of conclusion that is arrived at about where we are going in the future. Then with respect to the question of membership, Spain I think is very clear and I do not think that there can be an objection to the fact that the peseta is not now in the agreement because the ... is just completely the opposite. It would make progress, it is very likely that very soon the peseta could be in the ERM. On the other hand, I want to remind you of the discussion that we had at the beginning and the discussion that we had even in the  Committee of Governors, where it was explained to us very clearly that for  legal reasons it would be impossible really to change the nature of co-ordination in the Committee of Governors because there are legal obstacles to overcome. It is because of that that we thought it would be necessary to change the Treaty. At least the message by the highest political authority that the Treaty was going to be changed, and I suppose that we will allow for certain central banks to be in a different position at the moment of the discussion on monetary co-ordination, otherwise I am afraid that stage one will be just a continuation, as Mr. Godeaux said, of the actual situation. It was explained to us that it would not be possible to go further even if personally the representative of the central bank who liked the legal situation as such that we cannot make any progress in that field. Finally, of course, there is this political situation that maybe it is impossible for political reasons to make in important step and that our Report finishes like the Werner Report. Well, if there is not a_ political condition this Report should finish like the Werner Report because it is not possible to change it. I think it is much better to be clear on that point, maybe it is impossible to make any progress, not just to give the impression to the Public that we are going to change certain things, which in fact we know we are not going to because there is no political agreement. It doesn't depend on us, but I do not think that we should  collaborate to give the wrong signals to the public opinion on that field.  M. P.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 19.
 Jaans (672 - 703)  When looking at the present draft of the Report, one thing which is striking is that the EMS is only mentioned in the initial version as something which had weaknesses, something the potential of which has not been fully used. We have lived 10 years with the EMS and writing a Report on progress towards economic and monetary union and talking about something which would be so much more constraining while the EMS is still incomplete, would I think not be very realistic on our part. Therefore, the suggestion to complete the EMS first and to have that as a strong, not only a Single, move towards economic and monetary union seems to me a quite adequate move, and therefore, in terms of the proposal by Gov. Leigh-Pemberton, it fits my view rather well.  With regard to timing and the question of whether to embark now on a new Treaty or to embark now on preparatory work, I think we should be  aware that we are not particular experts on economic union, we are not particular experts on designing out what Ministers of Finance could in the budgetary and fiscal field see as useful co-ordination procedures, so definitely what we write in this Report are indications, but I think that the Ministers and adequate working groups of the Ministers should go in depth on that point. Therefore ait would also seem to me premature to. say let's start on a negotiation immediately. We should Suggest to prepare a negotiation. My concern is that this Report should be realistic and build on what we have at present and not, so to say, indicate what the Werner Report did at a time when the Community had 6 members, well, we do not give a timetable, but to be overprecise about certain things. Many things have  to be studied further.  Mr. N.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their viewpoint and suggesting that the EMS should be completed before moving towards economic and monetary union. They also suggest that the Ministers and working groups should go into depth on certain points and that the Report should be realistic and build on the current situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 20.
 Thygesen (704 - 741)  I would advance 3 arguments in favour of advocating a Treaty change immediately, as Gov. de Larosiére has done, in addition to those of giving a signal. The first is that we have discovered in our discussion of the present EMS that the scope for intensifying co-ordination Significantly beyond what exists today is very limited. That was a result of the inquiry suggested by Gov. Hoffmeyer. In order to make a qualitative improvement in the EMS, it is necessary to have a Treaty change.  The second point is that I think it is unfortunate that some members of the Committee seem to regard comprehensive membership of the present EMS as a substitute, an equally strong Signal, as a Treaty change. Let me put it abit bluntly, and I apologise to Gov. Leigh-Pemberton because some of the remarks are directed at the UK. If we look at what happens in the UK we see that monetary policy is oriented very much towards domestic concerns, volatility of interest rates and exchange rates have increased if anything, that decision-making on interest rates is highly politicised; these are factors that would within the framework of the present EMS destabilise the system rather than improve it. I think it is a somewhat facetious argument to say that comprehensive membership is an essential improvement of the EMS. Something stronger is required to accommodate a member such as the UK: a system where there is no doubt that there 1s an element of collective monetary policy.  My third point is that the UK authorities have in a number of statements, and you also Gov. Leigh-Pemberton, said that EMU is not on the  agenda .at:.an: early time and have over-emphasised in a sense the  impossibility of having any form of independent policy within an EMU. (Leigh-Pemberton: full EMU) I think that this Committee is answering some of your concerns in other parts of the Report, notably in Part II that we discussed yesterday, and we need also for that reason to reiterate that EMU is the aim and to do so at an early stage.  Finally, I would just like to note that, in contrast to what Gov. Pohl says, a decision to convene a conference to discuss a Treaty change is not a matter for unanimous decision but a matter for a simple majority in  the European Council, as we saw in the case of the Single Act.  Mr. E.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker disagrees with some members of the Committee who believe that comprehensive membership of the present EMS is enough without a Treaty change. The speaker argues that a Treaty change is necessary for a qualitative improvement in the EMS. The speaker also disagrees with the UK authorities' stance on EMU, stating that they have over-emphasized the impossibility of having any form of independent policy within an EMU.


Passage number 21.
 Hoffmeyer (741 - 772)  It 1s clear where my position is, but I think that one should be aware of the fact that we all agree that one should tell the Heads of State that if they want to realise an economic and monetary union there should be a decision to embark on the entire process. This is the fundamental issue and it is curious that we discuss in a sense political advice to the Heads of State much more than this essential thing. That is as if we were Secretaries of the Heads of State, telling them you should give a_ signal and one signal is more important than the other. Do you really think that a signal, when you look at all the statements and communiques that have been published during the years, do you really think that a statement by the Heads of State which is clearly unrealistic would be a better signal than, for instance, if the Heads of State said now we engage on this process and we embark on the entire process, and to show our goodwill we all join the present applications. Wouldn't you expect this to be a much stronger signal than to say we embark now on a Treaty negotiation which, well, when would it last. Do you really think that people will attach much importance to that. It is a question of being a secretary to a political authority. Then I think that one could imagine that you could say well, you will have to choose yourself, you are politicians so you will find the best signal. There are these various things and that would be a compromise. But the essence is that there you have to embark on the whole process if you want  to realise it.  M. A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The author expresses their position and offers a suggestion, but there is no explicit disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 22.
 Lamfalussy (773 - 850) , I would like to make a few points and perhaps talk a little  longer than I usually do. The first point I would like to make is about the  way I tried to draft this 2nd sub-para., which is at the centre of the discussion. When I put that to you in one of our last meetings this was done already in a spirit of compromise, the compromise comes out in the way it is drafted, and I did it rather carefully not to make it prescriptive. It is a descriptive statement. It may be strong in some of the words, one can change that, but it is a descriptive statement which of course sets the tone but does not prescribe anything to anyone. Please read it in that sense. That is simply on the way it is drafted. Now let me come to the substance, and I must say that I don't necessarily stick to this para. and I am ready myself to envisage a number of alternatives, but let me talk about the substance.  What 1s stage one about. The only substantive point in stage one, as it stands today, is that the Committee of Governors would shift in its practice from ex post discussion of monetary policy events gradually towards an ex ante co-ordination effort of monetary policies. If you go through the text, this is the only thing that is in that stage one. (.: may I correct you, there are many other things in stage one). This is the thing that on reading it one would really retain. This is a very important thing, I am not saying that this is an unimportant thing, it is an extremely important matter and it is important in two ways. On the one hand, because it would mean. that the Governors themselves would change their method of work; and secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, they would give recommendations and express views on monetary policies, which goes even further because that involves not only themselves but in most countries it involves the Governments. They would give recommendations and that is an extremely important step. I am not complaining about the lack of substance in that stage, I think it is an important change.  Here I come to my problem of credibility. Let me quite frankly tell you that I have a rather unique position in the sense that I have participated in the meetings of the Governors for 10 years, so I saw it from inside and at the same time not being a member of the Committee, not being a Governor, I can look at it from outside as well, both sitting in this building and having some sort of external view on these events. If I take my external hat, but also looking at my own experience, I was sitting in that Committee at the time the EMS was discussed and I did even take a rather active part in some of the discussions, I think that the view of the  external world is that if this Committee of Governors does not receive an external impulse to move in the direction which is suggested in stage one, that this move from ex post discussions towards an ex ante co-ordination of policies will not happen. It will not happen because that is not the way a group of central bankers works. When the EMS was set up, it was the result of an external political impulse and this is the more so since what you ask here is that the Governors are willing and ready to give advice to Governments on monetary policy. It is a very important step. So any outside observer who will read this Report will say, but why on earth has that not happened already. If this can be done without any external political impulse it ought to have happened already. It hasn't happened, therefore why 1s is going to happen. This is why I used the word credibility. I am Saying this very bluntly, because I do care for the Governors as much as anyone can, and I am really interested in their own credibility and also in their own ability to perform this change, which I do not think they have unless there is an external impulse. How should that external impulse come. There I can see a number of ways and I am not doctrinaire about it in any sense and I can imagine that the way the drafting is done in Wim's proposal at the end can go quite a long way in that direction, but you need an  external impulse to be credible in the implementation of stage one.  Mr. M.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing various points and expressing the need for an external impulse for credibility in the implementation of stage one.
