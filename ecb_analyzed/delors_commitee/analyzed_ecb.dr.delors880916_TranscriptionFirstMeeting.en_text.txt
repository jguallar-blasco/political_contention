COMMITTEE FOR THE STUDY OF 7 16th September 1988 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION   Meeting on 13th September 1988 (BIS, Room E)

Passage number 1.
The Chairman (000 - 60) (Interpretation)  First of all I should like to thank M. Lamfalussy and the BIS for having agreed to help us to run these meetings. We have to end at 17.30 in order to enable all members of the Committee to be present at the time the conclusions will be drawn before the next meeting. I shall very briefly discuss one or two things. First of all we shall formerly appoint the two rapporteurs. This is a matter that we have discussed with each member of the group and I wish to ask you to confirm your agreement to the appointment of Mr. Gunter Baer and Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa as rapporteurs. We are going to ask them to come in. They will keep the minutes of the meeting, minutes which will be kept here at the BIS, they will not be made generally available. I will put a technical question to you: would you agree to the discussions being recorded and to being kept in great secrecy here at the BIS or are you against recording. I leave the decision to you. It is obvious that the rapporteurs will note the main points, but some things may escape their attention and it would be very helpful to them if we had a tape which they could refer to, a tape which would be kept here confidentially. Would you agree to this, Mr. Governors.  Thirdly, I suggest that we issue neither a press statement, nor do we hold a press conference, not even for your Chairman. A press statement might be useful but I am afraid that that would probably waste an hour and half here amongst ourselves trying to settle on such a statement, even if it were to be only fifteen lines long. Therefore we are going to work and if anybody puts any question to me I shall say that we work in a good atmosphere, that we are all aware of the mandate given us by the Heads of Government. Never are we going to give the impression that there is  disagreement amongst us. We are a team, we do teamwork to serve our Masters  and that is all. Were we a group of academics, doubtlessly there might be differences of opinion, but we are not going to dramatise them and we are not going to turn the meeting of this group into a series, like Dynasty or Dallas - and one that would be less attractive too.    Fourthly, I should like to emphasise the highly confidential  nature of our meetings. 

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct contention or disagreement. Rather, it focuses on practical matters such as appointing rapporteurs, recording discussions, and handling media statements. The speaker emphasizes the need for confidentiality and unity within the group.


Passage number 2.
 Herrn K.0O. Péhl (60 - 73)  We should never quote each other. Nobody should quote the position of anybody in this group, but on the other hand, of course we should feel free to express our own views on the subject, but never referring to these meetings. I think that should be the basic rule for our co-operation. It is unavoidable, at least for one or the other, to make remarks or to speak on the substance of the discussions at one or -other  occasion, but never quote each other.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author states that while they should not directly quote each other in their discussions, they can still express their own views without referring to the meetings. The author acknowledges that there may be instances where remarks or discussions are referenced, but it should not involve quoting each other. Overall, the passage presents a suggestion for cooperation rather than any disagreement.


Passage number 3.
 The Chairman (74 - 76) (Interpretation)  Each one will speak on his own behalf and nobody will repeat the  views of another member of the Committee. 

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The passage states that each member of the committee will speak for themselves without repeating the views of others. This indicates that there is no contention or disagreement, as each member is given the opportunity to express their own opinions without interference.


Passage number 4.
 Mr. M.F. Doyle (76 - 78)  Just one question. Does that mean that we don't get a copy of the  minutes ourselves, individually.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The passage is asking a simple question and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 5.
 The Chairman (78 - 84) (Interpretation)  You will be able to look them up and read them here. You can even  listen to part of the tape if you wish, but here. 
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it simply provides information about being able to access and read certain materials.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 6.
 Herrn K.O. Péhl (84 - 90)  I would also suggest that even you as our Chairman are not  obliged to report to the Council of Ministers, because we are in the  0 sf a. ee  PA tt  TRE gE Mea ae, RRR NTR se . p ’ process of discussions and it would be premature to make any reports before  we have finalised our own report. The Chairman . (90 - 96)  Our duty is to have one or two meetings with the European Parliament but purely for formal reasons and I do not intend to deliver any  subject discussed inside the Committee.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage states that the speaker only intends to have meetings with the European Parliament for formal reasons and does not intend to discuss any subject discussed inside the Committee. This suggests a disagreement or contention with the idea of engaging in substantive discussions with the European Parliament.


Passage number 7.
 The Chairman (96 - 131) (Interpretation)  Finally, the fourth point on which I seek you opinion is this. Our work here is entirely confidential and this confidentiality has to be protected. Confidentiality is very well protected as far as the meetings of the Committee of Governors are and we would like this Committee to benefit from the same confidentiality. Unfortunately two days ago there was a press article which revealed part of the contents of one of the working papers and this is a great pity. We really have to be disciplined if we wish to prevent the members of the press from speculating about what we are likely to say. If there is going to be an open political discussion, this will take place at the European Council level and before that there is no such discussion needed. In particular, we should not make available parts of our documents to the press.  Finally, my last point. I received a letter from M. Giscard d'Estaing on behalf of the Committee for European Monetary Union and he says that, together with his Co-Chairman, Mr. Helmut Schmidt, and the Executive Secretariat of his Committee, he would like to be heard by us. Now, there are one or two things you can decide. Either you accept the idea or M. Godeaux, the Chairman of the Committee of Governors, and another member assisting me, I would receive Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Giscard d'Estaing to a dinner and I would listen to what they have to say. What do you  prefer. What are your feelings. Dr. W.F. Duisenberg . (131 - 134)  I prefer that this Committee does not go into hearings. Now it is  Giscard and Schmidt and then it will be someone else. If you are to be so  -4-  polite as to receive this elderly statesman it would be entirely agreeable  to me. 
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their preference for the committee to not go into hearings and expresses agreement with receiving an elderly statesman.


Passage number 9.
 Herrn K.O. Péh1 (134 - 136)  On an entirely private basis of course and you don't charge us  with the expenses for the dinner.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward statement discussing a private arrangement for expenses.


Passage number 10.
 The Chairman (137 - 159) (Interpretation)  I don't intend to send the bill to the Bundesbank.  As the members of the Committee agree to the discussions being recorded, is this possible right away.  In order to save time I am going to abstain from introducing the discussion. Having consulted all the members of the Committee and having heard you earlier on, and having noticed that you refer time and again to the Werner Report, and in particular to the definition of economic and monetary union contained therein, I thought that perhaps it would be a good idea to look at the contents of this report, at what followed the report and the reasons why the objectives contained in this report were not reached. I think it would be a good starting point for the unavoidable brain-storming we have to engage in at the beginning on the basis of a  two-fold, or rather treble, experience. 

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their intentions and suggesting a starting point for a discussion, but there is no contradicting or arguing with anyone else's viewpoints.


Passage number 11.
 The Rt. Hon. Robert Leigh-Pemberton (457 - 496)  -.-.- Some temptation exists then in my opinion, in the absence of progress in those areas, for perhaps excessive emphasis to be placed by politicians on monetary and exchange rate co-operation. May I just say that I am firmly of the view that if in fact progress is to be made it has got to be parallel progress with monetary and exchange rate co-operation on the one side and economic progress on the other. I think for these reasons we need to be on our guard, therefore, against attempts to force the pace of monetary integration, particularly towards the premature Blocking of parities which a union would imply. I don' t say that I am against monetary  integration, I am arguing about forcing the pace of it. I think the risk  - 5 -  arises because this aspect of economic and monetary union is probably technically easier to define and to effect than economic conversions. There are therefore clear political temptations to go out for it in the hope that once it is achieved the other necessary successful elements of EMU will follow. In short, an attempt to force monetary union ahead of economic and even political union has the danger perhaps of failing, and to that extent possibly even discrediting monetary union. In these circumstances I find myself inclined towards the step-by-step approach, not the “petit pas", the tiny steps necessarily, they could be substantial steps, but steps they need to be even though they may be less glamorous and concentrate on steady consolidation of successive advances on all fronts instead of what one might call a “dash for the grand" concept. May I just emphasise again the importance that I attach to what I call "parallelism", if I can use that word to describe progress being made at roughly the same pace towards economic union as it is made towards monetary integration. I hope that those few expressions of principle, Mr. Chairman, put a slant onto Werner  as I look at it now which my colleagues may find helpful. 

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is expressing their own opinion and discussing the potential risks and temptations of forcing the pace of monetary integration. There is no clear contention or disagreement being presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 12.
 Dr. W.F. Duisenberg (508 - 594)  -.-- Kconomic union to me is more than the internal market alone when all physical barriers have disappeared. Economic union, because monetary union affectively implies having one currency, implies also co-ordination or at least a degree of centralisation of policies in other areas, i.e. in budgetary and fiscal policy. That is part of economic union. From the outset, I agree with Leigh-Pemberton that economic and monetary union is the end phase, that is what we have to strive at, and I am not against the step-by-step approach towards that end, however long it may take. But the end should be clear in our minds, that is the first thing for us to do. ...   --. The years that have passed and the experience that we have gained have clearly enhanced the chances of realising Werner after all. Weaknesses are in particular in the domain of policies where towards the end of economic and monetary union a degree of centralisation is necessary, but where it cannot be denied we have deep differences of opinion on the nature and the measure wherein there has to be a transfer of sovereignty to  a centralised institution, whether it-be in a federal form or completely  centralised. The analysis rightly states that with the transfer of monetary authorities, the institutional arrangements have been inadequately precisely defined, and that has been a hindrance to progress in this area. For example, the FECOM is under the right of directives of the Council of Ministers and for that reason maybe the FECOM has not been the success which had been envisaged. ...   --» The co-ordination of monetary policy is also severely hindered by insufficient convergence of government finance, whether the result that too large government deficits or the ways in which they are being financed in a number of countries - my own perhaps not being excluded - are a severe hindrance for the further co-ordination of monetary policy. Identification of monetary co-ordination cannot solve this problem, then you need to go further. If you try to do that through monetary policy only, it would create interest rate differentials which could be enormous and which would create political tensions in the Community and which would be detrimental economically speaking. We all know through our experiences that monetary policy alone cannot carry the burden on its own and that budgetary policy has to give its contribution. The existing procedures of co-ordination are too free, we need more centralisation there and the transfer for sovereignty. That is the end goal to which we, I think, have to work and once we have defined that end goal I am not at all against a step-by-step approach as long as we know what we are doing and what we are  working for, aiming at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The passage contains disagreement or differing opinions on the nature and degree of centralization in economic and monetary union. The speaker acknowledges that there are deep differences of opinion on the transfer of sovereignty to a centralised institution, whether in a federal form or completely centralised. The speaker also suggests that the existing procedures of co-ordination are too free and advocates for more centralization and the transfer of sovereignty.


Passage number 13.
  Mr. M. Boyer (651 - 690) (Interpretation)  --. Since we are moving very quickly from the analysis of the Werner Report to an analysis of the existing situation, it seems to me that we should begin by selecting a modest approach, not a maximalistic approach but a minimalistic approach. We do not yet have enough of an impulse in respect of our ultimate objectives - single currency, European Central Bank, fixed exchange rates. What we have is a set of political decisions and from these political decisions we have to deduce monetary consequences. The liberalisation of capital movements will expose the European Monetary System to shocks which will be much greater than any shocks encountered by the system since 1979. Therefore, one has a feeling that one has to move  forward, but mot so much towards an objective which will give rise to  -7J-  political disagreement, but rather to generate a development which will be capable of ensuring that the system will at least operate as well as it has in the recent past, and that it will be capable of absorbing the shocks which will result from the liberalisation of ‘capital movement - speculation, etc. Thus, if one wonders if one wishes to go all out for a quantum leap or whether that would be dangerous, whether a more modest approach is to be preferred, it seems to me that the latter is to be preferred - to move very modestly and carefully forward. As we do this there will be different alternatives, different concepts as to what is a minimum requirement and what, on the other hand, is perhaps not the absolute minimum requirement but something over and above that. Then one might also consider the more distant political future. It seems to me that our starting point now is not that we have to converge towards an economic and monetary union which is clearly defined, but rather to try and identify the monetary consequences of the political decisions that have already been made, i.e. liberalisation of capital movements and the single market. It is after this analysis that we will probably be able to embark on a discussion  of the next stages - steps large or small - towards the ultimate goal. 

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 14.
 Dott. C.A. Ciampi (766 - 774) (Interpretation)  eee It seems to me, therefore, that the first such intermediate step would have to be something which would show clearly that the system as it exists today and which we have to consolidate, bearing in mind all the dangers referred to by Prof. Boyer, we will have to propose something which will enable clearly the system to grow still further so as to generate even more confidence in what we are doing, indicating that we know where we are  going and that we know how we are going there. Herrn K.O.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion about the necessary steps to consolidate the existing system and generate more confidence.


Passage number 15.
 Péhl (864 - 910)  -.. There are several points in the Werner Report which I think are still valid. One is the emphasis, which has been rightly said by previous speakers already, on parallelism. This is very important, particularly for central bankers (and I am very grateful Carlo that you said it), that we need of course, if we want to come nearer to an economic  and monetary union, much closer co-operation and co-ordination, not only of  monetary policies, where I think we have made more progress than in other areas, but we need that also in fiscal policy, in demand management policies and in macro-economic policies as a whole. We have enormous imbalances. in some areas, the real economy that is the real problem not the lack of credit facilities, etc. So we have to emphasise in our report (I hope that we can reach agreement on that point) what has been said already in the Werner Report, that you need progress on all levels so to say of co-ordination. That can, of course, also have institutional consequences, not only in the field of monetary policy (we are talking about the European Central Bank, etc.) but what about institutional provisions for a better co-ordination of fiscal policy, regional policies. Is it conceivable, for instance, to have a system with exchange rates which cannot be changed any more or only under very restrictive conditions without having a very developed system of what we call in German “Finanzausgleich" - I don't know whether there is an English word for that - transfers of financial resources. For instance, that is something I would be prepared to subscribe to in the common report in order to make the politicians and the heads of governments aware of the consequences of a more fixed exchange rate system. This is one element of the Werner Report which I think is still valid and which we can still use.   The other one - and I think we should use that as a starting point for our report - is the definition of what we are aiming for. We need something like that, we have to know what the final goal is before we talk about steps to get there. I fully agree with what you said, Robin, of ‘course, we should not have any illusions, and I think none of us has any illusions about what is possible. Before we talk about the steps to come to monetary and economic union we have to know what it means and I think the Werner Report provides us with a very good definition both of the economic union and the monetary union. The definition of a monetary union is very simple but still valid: it is free movement of capital, full convertibility of currencies and irreversible fixing of exchange rates. This is a very simple definition but it has of course enormous consequences if you take it seriously. We should start with that definition and from there we can maybe find some proposals, hopefully we can make some proposals, as to how we can get a little closer to this final stage. I don't want to discuss that at this stage already. ‘  - 9 _ Mr. M.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and support for the points made in the Werner Report.


Passage number 16.
 Rubio (932 - 966) (Interpretation)  ... The second point I wanted to make is that it is quite clear that if we don't have a clear view of the final objective then I think we -cannot draw a common view. I think that that is no longer the case. We have a clear view of what we would like to do, clearer than we had then. We also know exactly what effort that entails, but I do know that it will be difficult to reach this aim of economic and monetary union. As I said we have to have a clear definition. From the Werner Report we know what the objective is supposed to be. It is quite clear, therefore, that we will have to take certain steps, but these steps, as Governor Ciampi said, should be steps that will allow us or even force us to take further steps forward. That brings me to the point of the timetable. It is quite clear that if we have a timetable, the timetable has to have a certain rigidity. If it is too rigid it can be counterproductive because if we cannot: stick to the timetable as we had fixed it for ourselves, that means that the project which we were supposed to achieve through the timetable might be endangered as well. You have to have certain constraints, certain obligations here, because if you don't say anything as to what you want to do by when, then the whole thing becomes totally vague and it will not be implemented at all. The progress we have made in the Community so far I think has shown us that you could not always make progress everywhere at the same time, that is absolutely impossibly. You cannot make the same sort of progress in the same way simultaneously with the same number of steps for all areas where you want to reach progress. I think in the Community so far we have seen that it was possible to take steps to institute mechanisms which then led us to make progress in other areas as well. If we look at all this and if we then ask ourselves what steps do we have to take in order to ensure this convergence of economic policies, we see immediately that it is a rather difficult task we have fixed ourselves. What we can do at least is to try and establish certain mechanisms which will then force us towards greater convergence in all areas of economic policy. I think that there we will probably have to follow the example of other small-step procedures. Look at the European Monetary System, that was also in a small-steps procedure perspective. Firstly, you took one small step where you had no institutional implications involved, but this first small step  later on led to a greater convergence of the economic policies of the  - 10 -  various member countries and that in itself would have been quite difficult  to foresee without that first step. M. J.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 18.
 Hoffmeyer (1123 - 1152)  --. L would agree with Karl Otto Péhl that one shouldn't be too pessimistic about evaluating the Werner Report. Of course, you can say that the report was a philosophy, it failed because of bad shocks or wrong philosophies, fine-tuning, or you have this very fine argument which I think is highly dangerous that if they had been better politicians they could arrange again between decisions and the market mechanism. But God couldn't do that in paradise. I don't think that it is easy to do that and I don't think you should try to explain to the politicians that that would be a thing which we could tell them how to do. I think that there is one feature about the Werner Report and the later experience that is common, that is that you have a goal and then you think you have some instruments, either you agree on them and you have an institution where you have the instruments. Actually they proposed a European co-operation fund and it was established, but it doesn't work. The curious thing is that this was repeated in 1979/80, because the decision of Bremen and Brussels in 1978 was also to create an institution, a fund, and at that time there was a report with Werner but it was cut in half and the first part was thrown away. 1 think that Padoa-Schioppa was instrumental also in writing the report at that time, where you dealt with the question of the fund, but it was not established. So one has to ask the question, why has it been impossible to create these two institutions in a workable way. One can then of course come to the conclusion that an economic union has_ been established in spite of the failure to try to establish these things. I think we have to be very clear about the definition of an economic union  and how far we have come to realising this objective. 

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. There are statements of opinion and observations, but no explicit disagreement between different parties.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 19.
 Mr. D.J. Chalikias (1210 - 1214)  --- Countries that do not participate in the exchange rate mechanism, like my own, should make a firm time commitment for full participation along with the implementation of policies that will enable  them to join ERM with no measure . in their economy.  - 13 - Prof. N.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The author argues that countries that do not participate in the exchange rate mechanism should make a firm time commitment for full participation, which implies that they currently do not have such a commitment. Additionally, the author states that these countries should implement policies to enable their participation in the ERM, suggesting that they currently lack those policies.


Passage number 20.
 Thygesen (1299 - 1327) —  Mr. Chairman, the Werner Report has been praised for stating the final objective clearly and that is well justified. I would be more complementary also on one additional point: it did define a first stage. Despite its emphasis on parallel progress in monetary and other areas, the governments also went ahead and established the SNAKE, the mechanism that kept several of the Community's currencies together in the 1970s. That was a useful learning experience and the Community would have been worse off if we had not had that inspiration from the Werner Report. Subsequently, that developed into the European Monetary System as other countries joined. There is no doubt that for a long time monetary integration, particularly now in the 1980s, has tended to run ahead of economic integration. I think it would be worrisome if we were to draw the inference from the Werner. Report that progress always has to be in parallel, has to wait for the area that iS most difficult. At one time it was necessary to move ahead in the monetary area, even if economic integration was not progressing. I suggest that we have today a situation where economic integration has to a large extent caught up with the monetary co-operation that we have and that therefore this group, and after all although the mandate is one of both economic and monetary union, it is a Committee largely of central bankers so it would be expected of the group that it concentrates to some extent on the monetary aspects of integration, that it considers also the possibility that monetary integration in the next phase runs a little bit ahead of economic integration in the broad sense. Governor Hoffmeyer said that if we have economic integration, an economic union, why is it necessary also to have monetary union. I think there are additional, separate benefits in monetary union if by that we understand ultimately a single currency. Some benefits can only be realised through monetary union. One might imagine economic union in a wide sense without monetary integration, but surely  some benefits in terms of removal of risks, lower transaction costs, possibility of more transparent and efficient markets, are only achievable if you have full monetary integration. I hope that this Committee will in its assessment also of Werner be appreciative of the fact that at that  stage one did move ahead in monetary integration.

Passage number 21.
 Herrn K.O. P&Gh (1504 - 1546)  I just want to say that I think that Mr. Doyle put his finger on the crucial question and that is the question of exchange rates, which is not mentioned in your paper, which is very good - I appreciate your paper. This question is not mentioned, it is only mentioned in the context of the Werner definition where it is said that monetary union means irreversibly fixed exchange rates and this is certainly the point of no return. We have to distinguish between a world in which exchange rates are still maybe fixed but adjustable as in the EMS, or even more or less flexible as in the case of the United Kingdom, and a world with fixed exchange rates which cannot be changed at all. In that world that would have far-reaching consequences and maybe we have to make our governments aware of these consequences at least in our report. It means, for instance, that there has to be closer, not only co-operation, but there has to be a common fiscal policy, even if it is in a federation you need some common budget, for instance. The Community budget would be much too small in such a system, you would need a much bigger budget which is not only concentrating on agricultural policy but also on many other areas of policy - infrastructure, etc. There is only one consequence: this has far-reaching consequences for wage policies, for instance. There has to be a flexible wage policy. There is no chance to have exchange rates as a buffer for divergent developments. I think there can't be different interest rates as well and so you need a common monetary policy; that is very close to a European Central Bank, but it can be conducted also in other ways of close co-operation between national central banks, but you need a common monetary policy. As long as you have exchange rates and the possibility of exchange rate changes, there is not the same degree of pressure for co-ordination. You can of course have a system in which one country puts more emphasis on growth and the other country more emphasis on price stability, because that can be corrected both by interest rate differentials and, as a last resort, by exchange rate changes. Of course, you need some convergence and there is also some pressure on convergence if it is a system like the EMS, but it is by far not the same degree of pressure which you have when you do the last steps, so to say, in fixed exchange rates.  My proposal, 1 think we have to be a little more practical  because our time is very limited - we have only a few meetings - and we  -  - 15 -  have been asked to make proposals. What I would suggest is that in our report we start with the little historical reminiscence on what M. Werner has told us and what we have achieved and what we have not achieved. There will certainly not be much disagreement amongst us. Then we can spend some pages on an analysis. ‘of this kind. Then we have to come to the third chapter, which is by far the most difficult chapter, the one which we are asked for - to make proposals. The only proposal I have heard this afternoon is the one by Jacques de Larosiére about the brief at this stage. Maybe we should at least prepare ourselves for our next meeting and think about what kind of concrete proposals we will make. Maybe we cannot all make the same proposals but maybe we can make a sort of shopping list for our Heads of State and governments of several proposals. I want to be  reluctant today, I don't want to make any proposals but maybe next time. 

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mostly a statement of the speaker's perspective and suggestions for the report.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 22.
 Mr. M. Boyer (1590 - 1605) (Interpretation)  Mr. Chairman, I told you when I took the floor the first time how concerned I was with the question of which of the two alternatives we are to opt for. One was based on economic and monetary union as defined in the Werner Report, another possibility would be the possibility of finding the greatest possible common denominator of the members around this table and to start from that, taking into account of course also the question of what the greatest common denominator of the governments might be. It is quite possible that we might agree here on a lot more than would be acceptable for the governments. Therefore our work would be purely theoretical because the political differences would be too great to start us even on a small first step. It would be possible that we might agree here on a definition of economic and monetary union and then we might just put forward the various stages that would have to be implemented, taking into account of course the changes vis-a-vis the time of the Werner Report. But if you try to go into detail and if you try to really discuss monetary union, leaving aside the economic factor for the moment, you immediately have the major problem of fixed exchange rates with no possibility of changing then,  because freedom of capital movement has been granted now. ... 
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker raises two different alternatives for achieving economic and monetary union and suggests that there may be disagreement or political differences among the members about which option to choose. The speaker also acknowledges the potential difficulties in discussing monetary union in detail, particularly regarding fixed exchange rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 23.
 Herrn K.O. Péhl (1665 - 1681)  In addition to what Wim said it is also the text of the mandate. It speaks of steps towards economic and monetary union and as long as we have no better definition of what monetary union is I think we have to use the definition of the Werner plan. I fully agree with what you said, of course, but if we would accept your position I think we should stop to talk about a common currency, a European Central Bank, etc., because by definition a single European currency means the abolition of exchange rates - by definition. Then concentrate, a that opinion actually, on more realistic concepts. One could say as a terminus tectnicus, maybe we could call it a soft union which is a monetary union with still the possibility of changes in exchange rates. Not a hard union, but a soft union. Maybe we can save a lot of time if we concentrate on that, but we should tell the Heads of State and governments that we are of the opinion and we have agreed that for the time being there is no realistic chance for monetary union in the sense of the Werner Report. We should be honest and we should say that and we should stop all this talk by people like Helmut Schmidt and Giscard, etc. If we are all of this opinion, if we all agree on that that would be a very strong statement, I would  subscribe it immediately.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the idea of a full monetary union, as defined by the Werner plan, is not realistic at the moment and suggests focusing on a "soft union" instead. This contradicts the positions of people like Helmut Schmidt and Giscard, who advocate for a common currency and a European Central Bank. The speaker believes that a strong statement should be made declaring the current unfeasibility of a full monetary union.
