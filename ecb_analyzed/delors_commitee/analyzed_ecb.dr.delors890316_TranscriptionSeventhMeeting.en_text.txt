Passage number 1.
COMMITTEE FOR THE STUDY OF 16th March 1989 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION  Meeting on 14th March 1989 (BIS, Room E)  M. P. Jaans (First tape 872 - 908)  I have some hope that between the positions expressed by Gov. Leigh-Pemberton and by Gov. de lLarosiére there is not a real and fundamental contradiction. I think if we tell the Heads of State in our Report that if and when they embark on the process of EMU, it is not just embarking on stage one and not on stage two, it is a whole process with three stages, and if they decide to go in that direction an early decision also has to be taken in order to revise the Treaty. I think if one is clear about the prerogative of the Heads of State to start the whole process, which should be just one process - it is not improving structures in the EMS that is a different thing, that has been done in Basle/Nyborg and that can be done also on the basis of Basle/Nyborg. If they decide to go in that direction then, of course, it is necessary also to have the Treaty revision and to have it during stage one. I think that is in my view a more apparent contradiction between the two positions expressed.  Two other points which I think are eminently political and where this Committee probably has not, let's say, the best expertise, or is not entitled to have the best expertise. One is the question of whether there should be one or more Treaty changes. We can indicate that this thing can  be done in one or more Treaty changes, but I think we should not, as is done at present, indicate a preference so to say for one Treaty change enabling provisions, etc., because the whole process is likely to last over more than one legislature and personally I would hesitate to take the right, so to say, to deprive a second legislature from the possibility to look at that and to foreclose anything by just one act where the Parliament  afterwards would be completely bound. That is one point which I think is a -2.2-  point which has to be left to the politicians. We should indicate that there are two ways but probably we should not express a preference.  A third element, also in my view eminently political, is the question of whether one can start EMU with not all members in it so to Say, if one can start it outside the Treaty, if one can embark in the direction of a two-speed way to work. There may be a lot of arguments to do that, but I think the point is so political it touches to the very heart of the Treaty and the whole philosophy of the Community that we, in my view, should just raise it, point to the fact that it is an eminently political  choice, but the choice has to be left to the Heads of State. M. A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their hope that there is no fundamental contradiction between the positions expressed by Gov. Leigh-Pemberton and Gov. de Larosiére. They suggest that if the Heads of State decide to embark on the process of EMU, it should be understood as a whole process with three stages and that a decision to revise the Treaty should be taken early. The speaker also highlights two other political points that should be left to the politicians. Overall, the passage is more about raising important political questions and leaving the final decisions to the Heads of State.


Passage number 2.
 Lamfalussy (911 - 974)  I think that Robin really raises a very substantial question and I was trying to make up my own mind on that’ question by reading the description of the first stage as if I had never heard about it; I was trying to make a reading as an outside reader, reading the Report for the first time. I think if you make the same effort you come to the conclusion that the only major substantive recommendation in that first stage today is to suggest that the Committee of Governors change their method of work and shift towards ex ante policy recommendations, which are not binding, of course, but which are explicit recommendations. That is a major shift and that is a major proposal, all the rest is interesting, but when you say the same thing about fiscal policies and budgetary policies you know perfectly well that there 1s no budgetary committee comparable to the Governors and with independent sovereign states that doesn't mean much. I am putting these things very bluntly, but that is how any reader would feel about it. I think this recommendation about the work of the Committee of Governors is a very serious one, a very important one, and I would certainly regard it as being a very important first step, and be happy with it as long as it can be regarded as being credible. There is nothing in the present status of the Governors that would prevent them, or would have prevented them . for the last 20 years, of doing it already and any reader of this Report would really come up with this first conclusion.  From there I jump to the second point of my reasoning which is to say that, in order to make the first step credible, there ought to be a  clear political signal, and I use the word in that sense, Signal or  - 3-  commitment which makes it clear that this first step is the beginning of a process -that is the point which was made by M. Jaans in a different way. We need a_ signal because otherwise nobody will take this recommendation seriously to be quite blunt. What is the political signal that you can expect. There, of course, you may have nuanced views. Clearly the most obvious political signal would be for the Heads of State and governments to say we decide to go ahead, and in order to show that we really mean business, we give instructions to our Ministers to start discussions on the Treaty. That is an unequivocal political signal, we don't have to say that "we recommend you to do that - no, we don't recommend it we simply say that to the extent that you want to go ahead and that you want the Governors to go ahead with the first step, please give a political signal and a political signal is, of course, a Treaty negotiation.  One can imagine other signals as well and I am not absolutely dogmatic about this point, what I am dogmatic about is that we need a political signal because otherwise the whole thing falls absolutely flat and will become totally incredible. What other signals could there be. Of course, a new Directive, beefing up the 1964 Directive could be done, but when you look at the Directive it is difficult to beef it up, it was there already in 1964, so what sort of credibility would you gain by adding to that. Then there is, of course, a third political signal which is not as constitutional as the Treaty negotiation but which is a very practical one. I will just mention it, and that is if the UK announced joining the EMS. That is the biggest most practical political signal that could be made. I would stop here by saying that what I am very insistent on, and I am rarely dogmatic, is the absolute need for a political commitment of some _ kind. What sort of political commitment. I am ready to ponder that, but the need for political commitment, to my mind, is absolutely essential. In the present formulation of the first stage, and that is where I join forces with J. de Larosiére, if the first stage was drafted in a different way, then that in itself could make a political commitment. But it doesn't give  that signal in its present form. Herrn K.O.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their own thoughts and opinions on a particular topic.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 5.
 Pohl (483 - 576)  I have much more radical proposals to make on this chapter on the ecu so maybe I can do it in context. This is really a question substance and I know that we disagree on that point, but I really want you to change the whole chapter on the ecu, which is not reflecting at least my views and maybe the views of others, it goes much too far and has not been discussed here with this content I think. My proposal would be to drop p. 37 from the first line until para. 55, but that may go a little too far, so I have a compromise proposal:  "The Committee examined various aspects of the role that the ecu could be expected to play in the process of economic and monetary integration in Europe. Firstly, the Committee was of the opinion that the monetary union does not necessarily require a single currency. However, political and psychological reasons suggest that a single currency would be a desirable feature of a monetary union. A declaration that the ecu, properly defined (not the basket ecu), should assume the role of the future single currency of the Community could be made at the outset, in order to ensure private agents that there would be no discontinuity between the present ecu and the single currency of the union, and that ecu obligations would be payable at face value in ecu if the transition to the single  currency had been made at the time of the maturity of the contract. But it - 10 -  was also felt that such a declaration might better be left for a time considerably closer to the birth of the common currency."  And then we have para. 55. Secondly, the Committee considers the possibility of adopting a parallel currency ...' And that we drop completely paras. 56 and 57 because we can say, if you want, that we should abolish all the administrative barriers for the use of the private ecu, '- that is-something we have agreed - but that would only be one sentence. I am not prepared to support the idea that the private use of the ecu should be encouraged because my own view is that the private ecu will lose importance more and more and we have to say at the beginning, in my view, that the ecu has not come up to expectation. The assessment of the ecu at the beginning in the first chapter is much too positive and absolutely incorrect if you take into account, for instance, what Lamfalussy's report said on the use of the ecu. I think the private ecu was attractive only at the time when we had capital controls and exchange controls and the private ecu has had only some attractiveness in countries with capital controls and exchange controls - in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark the ecu was never attractive for private users. We have abolished all barriers for the ecu and it is absolutely without any relevance, significance in Germany. Nobody holds an ecu account - some people do - but ecu bonds are not attractive and businesses are not really interested in that and so we give the ecu much too much relevance here in this chapter and it is really not the case, in fact. I have nothing against the ecu, it is an instrument it is not a currency. There are so many words here which I think are absolutely wrong. The ecu is not a currency, it is a basket of currencies, but here it is said that it should be granted the status of a foreign currency, we have always said that that is not our understanding of the ecu. It is a question of definition and it has no monetary policy relevance. The use of the official ecu is practically zero, no central bank in Europe holds significant amounts of ecu voluntarily, except the ones’ we get for our swaps, because all the settlements are done in DM or in dollars and maybe other currencies as well. We have this clearance System and it works, we can say OK well it has some relevance, but it is not correct to say that it has become an important currency, etc. We have to change the whole chapter, maybe our Rapporteurs can change it. I am not prepared to accept the proposal made by Mr. Thygesen on the monetary use, we can put  that in the Annex, but not under the headline of the Committee, only under - ll -  the headline of Mr. Thygesen. In that case I would suggest that all papers which have been presented to this Committee should be published in an Annex, including for instance the papers I have submitted to the Committee and others have: J. de Larosiére's paper, if he wants. (M. de Larosiére: I would be delighted.) But all under our own signature. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, but this is a point of substance and I cannot accept that, it gives a completely wrong view. Our views are very known, for years we have made them public, they are all described in my papers and I really wonder how this could be written here because it is known - or should be at least  - that this is not acceptable to me. M. P.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention and disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the current chapter on the ecu and proposes changes that reflect their own views. They argue that certain statements about the ecu are incorrect and that the private use of the ecu should not be encouraged. They also disagree with a proposed idea by Mr. Thygesen on the monetary use of the ecu. Overall, the speaker has significant disagreements with the current content and viewpoint of the chapter.


Passage number 6.
 Jaans (634 - 654)  The present draft is probably too triumphalistic or too strongly committing, so to say, on the private ecu. Therefore, why should we not simply stick to facts and say that the private ecu is a by-product of the creation of the EMS, that it has developed in private markets to an extent which 1s shown in the Annex, where the very useful and purely factual paper of Prof. Lamfalussy could be added, and one could say that for some economies it has played a stronger role than for others and that it has a kind of potential to develop into a genuine currency and that, in any case at the passage, the continuity of the value should be maintained. That would be not very committing on the part of this Committee, one would not try to raise monetary policy on it and all these things which are highly controversial and to which I could personally not subscribe either. It is a factual phenomenon, we can recognise it and I think for those who are, so to say, the great . of the private ecu - I am thinking of Ciscard/Schmidt Committee - if we add some facts about it and about its rather marginal character really for the time being that might altogether provide them with  more information. Herrn K.O.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting a more neutral and factual approach to discussing the private ecu without taking a strong stance or committing to any specific viewpoint.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 7.
 Pohl (768 - 853)  I think we have clear disagreement on this point, but this is nothing new, we know about this for 10 years because we discussed this already 11 years ago when we set up. the EMS. That was one of the main  points of disagreement from the beginning because we always had strong  - 12-  reservations against the encouragement of the use of the ecu for many many reasons, because it is developing into something of which we are losing control. We have national currencies which are controlled by national central banks, but there is something developing which we cannot’ control and then we approach a stage where we are asked to act as lender-of-last~-resort as central banks. This is a very substantial, serious concern, maybe it is exaggerated but this was always the German position on that. It is not only a question of goodwill, so to say. I am not. saying that we should be too negative, I am not against the private use of the ecu. We should leave it to the markets, as you have suggested, and we should say that we should not discriminate the ecu, but we should not discriminate national currencies either. That I think we should say. This is the case in some countries where other European currencies are discriminated against the ecu, that is also not really consistent with our aims. I have made a proposal to replace para. 54, which I have read. It is a little less enthusiastic, I think that should be acceptable. Para. 55 could stand as it is.  Para. 56, maybe we could say: "Thirdly, the Committee examined proposals for the use of the official ecu in the context of a common monetary policy. The Committee could not examine all the details of these  ' We have to make it clear that  _ proposals which are published in an Annex.' we have not agreed on that.  Then we say para. 57: "Fourthly, the Committee agreed that the voluntary use of the ecu by the private sector should not be discriminated, existing barriers should be abolished."  What I don't want to say is that we want to encourage both the official use or the private use, because that has far-reaching implications. For instance, the official ecu: if we encourage the use of the official ecu what does it mean. Do we really want to encourage the European governments to borrow in ecus. Do we want to encourage the German Government to borrow in lira and fr.fr. and pesetas. It is too expensive and really makes no sense at all. The official ecu only plays a role if there are disturbances in the exchange markets, because it only plays a role if there are interventions. If there are no interventions, the official ecu fortunately plays no role - fortunately.  The private ecu: it is a market instrument and if people want it,  it's OK, but why should we encourage it. Why should people be encouraged to - 13 -  use the private ecu instead of national currencies. I can see no reason and it has no relevance for monetary union.  If we say there should be no discrimination, it should be left to the markets, that I think would be fine with me. What I am against is. this "strong encouragement" - that is language which we are used to from the EEC and others, but which I would not support.  (Ciampi: Could Pohl re-read his proposal for para. 54 again.)  Pohl re-reads proposal.  (Ciampi: Would it be possible to say it the other way round.)  Yes, that's fine with me, you would say it would be desirable to have ... But that hasn't been said in the original text. But we have to say somewhere that a single currency is not necessarily necessary, maybe we don't have to say that, maybe it sounds a little negative and you are right, if we have irrevocably fixed exchange rates by definition we have a single currency.  Then there is a last sentence which we should not forget and it said: "But it was also felt that such a declaration - this is different to the previous text - might better be left for a time considerably closer to the birth of the common currency.'' That makes it clear that the common currency, the future currency, is something different from the basket ecu which we use today, which is fluctuating and has all the problems, particularly if some members of the EEC are not becoming members of the  ERM. Herrn K.O.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses reservations and concerns about the use and control of the ecu, and disagrees with the idea of encouraging its use. They argue against discrimination of national currencies and express skepticism about the need for a single currency.
